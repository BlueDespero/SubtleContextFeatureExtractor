Chapter 133.
The song of degrees. Lo! how good and how merry it is; that brethren dwell together. 
As ointment in the head; that goeth down into the beard, into the beard of Aaron. That goeth down into the collar of his cloth; 
as the dew of Hermon, that goeth down into the hill of Zion. For there the Lord sent blessing; and life till into the world, that is, without end.
