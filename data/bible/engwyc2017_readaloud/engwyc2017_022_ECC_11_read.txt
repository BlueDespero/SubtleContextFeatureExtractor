ECCLESIASTES.
Chapter 11.
Send thy bread up on waters passing forth, for after many times thou shalt find it. 
Give thou parts seven, and also eight; for thou knowest not, what evil shall come up on earth. 
If clouds be filled, they shall shed or pour out rain on the earth; if a tree falleth down to the south, either to the north, in whatever place it falleth down, there it shall be. 
He that espieth the wind, soweth not; and he that beholdeth the clouds, shall never reap. 
As thou knowest not, which is the way of the spirit, and by what reason bones be joined together in the womb of a woman with child, so thou knowest not the works of God, which is maker of all things. 
Early sow thy seed, and thine hand cease not in the eventide; for thou knowest not, what shall come forth more, this either that; and if ever either come forth together, it shall be the better. 
The light is sweet, and delightable to the eyes to see the sun. 
If a man liveth many years, and is glad in all these, he oweth to have mind of the dark time, and of many days; and when those shall come, the things passed shall be reproved of vanity. 
Therefore, thou young man, be glad in thy youth, and thine heart be in goodness in the days of thy youth, and go thou in the ways of thine heart, and in the beholding of thine eyes; and know thou, that for all these things God shall bring thee into doom. 
Do thou away ire or wrath from thine heart, and remove thou malice from thy flesh; for why youth and lust be vain things, or vanity.
