PSALMS.
Chapter 54.
To victory, in organs, either in psalms, the learning of David, when Ziphims came, and said to Saul, Whether David is not hid at us? God, in thy name, make thou me safe; and in thy virtue, deem thou me. 
God, hear thou my prayer; with ears perceive thou the words of my mouth. 
For aliens have risen against me, and strong men sought my life; and they setted not God before their sight. 
For lo! God helpeth me; and the Lord is the up-taker of my soul. 
Turn thou away evils to mine enemies; and lose thou them in thy truth. 
Willfully I shall sacrifice to thee; and, Lord, I shall acknowledge to thy name, for it is good. 
For thou deliveredest me from all tribulation; and mine eye despised on mine enemies.
