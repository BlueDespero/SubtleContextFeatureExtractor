ZECHARIAH.
Chapter 3.
And the Lord showed to me the great priest Joshua, standing before the angel of the Lord; and Satan stood on his right half, that he should be adversary to him. 
And the Lord said to Satan, The Lord blame in thee, Satan, and the Lord that chose Jerusalem, blame in thee. Whether this is not a dead brand ravished from the fire? 
And Joshua was clothed with foul clothes, and stood before the face of the angel. 
Which answered, and said to them that stood before him, and he said, Do ye away foul clothes from him. And he said to him, Lo! I have done away from thee thy wickedness, and I have clothed thee with changing of clothes. 
And he said, Put ye a clean mitre or cap on his head. And they putted a clean mitre or cap on his head, and clothed him with clothes. And the angel of the Lord stood, 
and the angel of the Lord witnessed to Joshua, and said, 
The Lord of hosts saith these things, If thou shalt go in my ways, and shalt keep my keeping, also and thou shalt deem mine house, and shalt keep my porches; and I shall give to thee goers, of these that now here stand nigh. 
Hear thou, Joshua, great priest, thou and thy friends that dwell before thee, for they be men signifying things to coming. Lo! soothly I shall bring my servant springing up, either Christ born. 
For lo! the stone which I gave before Joshua, on one stone be seven eyes; and lo! I shall engrave the engraving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I shall do away the wickedness of that land in one day. 
In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, a man shall call his friend under a vine, and under a fig tree.
