HOSEA.
Chapter 12.
Ephraim feedeth on the wind, and followeth heat. All day he multiplieth leasing, and destroying; and he made bond of peace with Assyrians, and bare oil into Egypt. 
Therefore the doom of the Lord is with Judah, and visiting is on Jacob; by the ways of him, and by the findings of him, he shall yield to him. 
In the womb he supplanted his brother, and in his strength he wrestled with the angel. 
And he was strong to the angel, and was comforted, or And he had victory at the angel, and he was comforted; he wept, and prayed to him; in Bethel he found him, and there he spake with us. 
And the Lord God of hosts, the Lord, is the memorial of him. 
And thou shalt turn to thy God. Keep thou mercy and doom, and hope thou evermore in thy God. 
Canaan loved false challenge, a guileful balance in his hand. 
And Ephraim said, Nevertheless I am made rich, I have found an idol to me; all my travails shall not find to me the wickedness, which I sinned. 
And I am thy Lord God from the land of Egypt; yet I shall make thee to sit in tabernacles, as in the days of feast. 
And I spake by prophets, and I multiplied vision, either prophesy, and I was likened in the hand of prophets. 
If Gilead worshippeth an idol, therefore they err in vain offering to oxes in Gilgal; for why and the altars of them shall be as heaps on the furrows of the field. 
Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and served, either kept sheep for a wife. 
But by a prophet the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was kept. 
Ephraim stirred me to wrathfulness in his bitternesses, and the blood of him shall come on him; and his Lord shall restore to him the shame of him.
