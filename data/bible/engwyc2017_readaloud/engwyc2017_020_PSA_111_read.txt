Chapter 111.
Alleluia. Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee in all mine heart; in the council, and congregation of just men. 
The works of the Lord be great; sought out into all his wills. 
His work is acknowledging and great doing; and his rightfulness or rightwiseness dwelleth into the world of world. 
The Lord, merciful in will, and a merciful doer, hath made a mind of his marvels; 
he hath given meat to men dreading him. He shall be mindful of his testament into the world; 
he shall tell to his people the strength of his works. That he give to them the heritage of folks; 
the works of his hands be truth and doom. All his commandments be faithful, 
confirmed into the world of world; made in truth and equity. 
The Lord sent redemption to his people; he commanded his testament without end. His name is holy and dreadful; 
the beginning of wisdom is the dread of the Lord. Good understanding is to all that do it; his praising dwelleth into the world of world.
