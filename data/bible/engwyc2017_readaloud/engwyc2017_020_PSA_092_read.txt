PSALMS.
Chapter 92.
The psalm of song, in the day of sabbath. It is good to acknowledge to the Lord; and to sing to thy name, thou Highest. 
To show early thy mercy; and thy truth by night. 
In a psaltery of ten cords; with song in harp. 
For thou, Lord, hast delighted me in the works of thy making; and I shall make full out joy in the works of thine hands. 
Lord, thy works be magnified greatly; thy thoughts be made full deep. 
An unwise man shall not know; and a fool shall not understand these things. 
When sinners come forth, as hay; and all they appear, that work wicked-ness. That they perish into the world of world; 
forsooth thou, Lord, art the Highest, without end. 
For lo! Lord, thine enemies, for lo! thine enemies shall perish; and all they shall be scattered that work wickedness. 
And mine horn shall be raised as an unicorn; and mine eld age shall be in plenteous mercy. 
And mine eye despised mine enemies; and when wicked men rise against me, mine ear shall hear of their downfall. 
A just or rightwise man shall flower as a palm tree; he shall be multiplied as a cedar of Lebanon. 
Men planted in the house of the Lord; shall flower in the porches of the house of our God. 
Yet they shall be multiplied in plenteous eld age; and they shall be suffering well. 
That they tell, that our Lord God is rightful or right; and no wicked-ness is in him.
