PSALMS.
Chapter 87.
The psalm of the song of the sons of Korah. The foundaments thereof be in holy hills; 
the Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the tabernacles of Jacob. 
Thou city of God, without end; glorious things be said of thee. 
I shall be mindful of Rahab, and Babylon; knowing me. Lo! aliens, and Tyre, and the people of Ethiopians; they were there. 
Whether a man shall say to Zion, And a man is born therein; and that man, alder Highest, founded it? 
The Lord shall tell in the scriptures of these peoples; and of these princes, that were therein. 
As the dwelling of all that be glad; is in thee.
