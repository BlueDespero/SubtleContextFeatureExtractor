Chapter 5.
To the overcomer, on the heritages, the psalm of David. Lord, perceive thou my words with ears; understand thou my cry. 
My King, and my God; give thou attention to the voice of my prayer. For, Lord, I shall pray to thee; 
hear thou early my voice. Early I shall stand nigh to thee, and I shall see; 
for thou art God not desiring wickedness. Neither an evil-willed man shall dwell beside thee; 
neither unjust or unrightwise men shall dwell before thine eyes. Thou hatest all them that work wickedness; 
thou shalt lose them that speak leasing. The Lord shall hold abomin-able a man-queller, and a guileful man. 
But Lord, in the multitude of thy mercy, I shall enter into thine house; I shall worship toward thine holy temple in thy dread. 
Lord, lead thou forth me in thy rightwiseness for mine enemies; dress thou my way in thy sight. 
For truth is not in their mouth; their heart is vain. Their throat is an open sepulchre, they did guilefully with their tongues; 
God, deem thou them. Fall they down from their thoughts; after the multitude of their wickednesses, or un-piousnesses, cast thou them down; for, Lord, they have stirred thee to wrath. 
And all that hope in thee, be they glad; they shall make full out joy into without end, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all that love thy name shall have glory in thee; 
for thou shalt bless the just or right-wise man. Lord, thou hast crowned us, as with a shield of thy good will.
