JOB.
Chapter 26.
Forsooth Job answered, and said, 
Whose helper art thou? whether of the feeble, and sustainest the arm of him, which is not strong? 
To whom hast thou given counsel? In hap to him that hath not wisdom; and thou hast showed full much prudence. 
Either whom wouldest thou teach? whether not him, that made breathing? 
Lo! giants wail under waters, and they that dwell with them. 
Hell is naked before him, and no covering is to perdition. 
The which God stretcheth forth the north upon void thing, and he hangeth the earth upon nought. 
And he bindeth waters in their clouds, that those or they break not out altogether downward. 
He holdeth the cheer of his seat, and spreadeth abroad thereon his cloud. 
He hath encompassed a term, or an end, to waters, till that light and darkness be ended. 
The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his will. 
In the strength of him the seas were gathered together suddenly, and his prudence smote the proud. 
His spirit hath adorned heavens, and the crooked serpent was led out by his hand, leading him out as a midwife leadeth out a child. 
Lo! these things be said in part of his ways; and when we have heard scarcely a little drop of his word, who may see the thunder of his greatness?
