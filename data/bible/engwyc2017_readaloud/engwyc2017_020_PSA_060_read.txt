Chapter 60.
To victory, on the witnessing of the rose, the sweet song of David, to teach men, when he fought against Aram of floods, and Syria of Zobah; and Joab turned again, and smote Edom in the valley of salt pits, twelve thousand. God, thou hast put away us, and thou hast destroyed us; thou were wroth, and thou hast done mercy to us. 
Thou movedest the earth, and thou troubledest it; make thou whole the sorrows thereof, for it is moved. 
Thou showedest hard things to thy people; thou gavest drink to us with the wine of compunction. 
Thou hast given a signifying to them that dread thee; that they flee from the face of the bow. 
That thy darlings be delivered; make thou safe with thy right hand, and hear thou me. 
God spake by or in his holy place; I shall be glad, and I shall part Shechem, and I shall mete or measure the great valley of tabernacles. 
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of mine head. Judah is my king; 
Moab is the pot of mine hope. Into Idumea I shall stretch forth my shoe; aliens be made subject to me. 
Who shall lead me into a city made strong; who shall lead me into Idumea? 
Whether not thou, God, that hast put away us; and shalt thou not, God, go out in our virtues? 
Lord, give thou to us help out of tribulation; for the help of man is vain. 
In God we shall make virtue; and he shall bring to nought them that trouble or disturb us.
