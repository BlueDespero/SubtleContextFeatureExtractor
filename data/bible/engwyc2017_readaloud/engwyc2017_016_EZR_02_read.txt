And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the holy of holy things, till a wise priest and a perfect man rose up. 
All the multitude being as one man, were two and forty thousand three hundred and sixty,

And of the princes of the fathers, when they entered into the temple of the Lord, that is, the place where the temple was, which is in Jerusalem, they offered of their free will into the house of God, to build it in his place; 
they gave by their mights the costs of the work, one and forty thousand pieces of gold; and five thousand bezants of silver; and priests’ clothes an hundred. 
Therefore priests, and deacons or Levites of the people, and singers, and porters, and Nethinims dwelled in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
