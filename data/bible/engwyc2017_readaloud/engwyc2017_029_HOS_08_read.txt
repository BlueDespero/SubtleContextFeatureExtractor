HOSEA.
Chapter 8.
A trump be in thy throat, as an eagle on the house of the Lord; for that that they went over my bond of peace, and brake my law. 
They called me to help, A! my God, we Israel have known thee. 
Israel hath cast away good thing, the enemy shall pursue him. 
They reigned, and not of me; they were princes, and I knew not. They made their gold and silver into idols to them, that they should perish. 
A! Samaria, thy calf is cast away; my strong vengeance is wroth against them. How long may they not be cleansed? 
for also it is of Israel. A craftsman made it, and it is not a god; for the calf of Samaria shall be into webs of araneida or spiders. 
For they shall sow wind, and they shall reap whirlwind. A stalk standing up is not in them, the seed shall not make meal; that if also it maketh meal, aliens shall eat it. 
Israel is devoured; now Israel is made as an unclean vessel among nations, 
for they ascended or went up to Assur. Ephraim is a wild ass, solitary to himself. They gave gifts to their lovers; 
but also with meed they hired nations. Now I shall gather them together, and they shall rest a little from burden of the king and of princes. 
For Ephraim multiplied altars to do sin, altars were made to him into trespass. 
I shall write to them my manyfold laws, that be areckoned as alien laws. 
They shall bring sacrifices, they shall offer, and eat fleshes; and the Lord shall not receive those or them. Now he shall have mind on the wickednesses of them, and he shall visit the sins of them; they shall turn into Egypt. 
And Israel forgat his maker, and builded temples to his idols, and Judah multiplied strong cities; and I shall send fire into the cities of him, and it shall devour the houses of him.
