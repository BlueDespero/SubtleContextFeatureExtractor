PSALMS.
Chapter 149.
Alleluia. Sing ye to the Lord a new song; his praising be in the church of saints. 
Israel be glad in him that made him; and the daughters of Zion make full out joy in their king. 
Praise they his name in a quire or choir; say they psalm to him in a tympan, and psaltery. 
For the Lord is well pleased in his people; and he hath raised mild men into health. 
Saints shall make full out joy in glory; they shall be glad in their beds. 
The full out joyings of God in the throat of them; and swords sharp on both sides in the hands of them. 
To do vengeance in nations; and blamings in peoples. 
To bind the kings of them in stocks; and the noble men of them in iron manacles. 
That they make in them the doom written; this is the glory to all his saints.
