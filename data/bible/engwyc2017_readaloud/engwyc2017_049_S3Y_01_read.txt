PRAYER OF AZARIAH & SONG OF THE THREE.
Chapter 1.
And they walked in the midst of the flame, and praised God, and blessed the Lord. 
Forsooth Azariah stood, and prayed thus; and he opened his mouth in the midst of the fire, and said, 
Lord, God of our fathers, thou art blessed, or Blessed art thou, Lord God of our Fathers, and worthy to be praised, and thy name is glorious into worlds; 
for thou art rightful in all things which thou didest to us, and all thy works be true; and thy ways be rightful or right, and thy dooms be true. 
For thou hast done true dooms, by or after all things which thou broughtest in on us, and on Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers; for in truth and in doom, thou broughtest in all these things for our sins. 
For we sinned, and did wickedly, going away from thee, 
and we trespassed in all things, and we heard not, neither kept thy commandments, neither we did as thou commandedest to us, that it should be or that it were well to us. 
Therefore thou didest by thy very doom all things which thou broughtest in on us, and all things which thou didest to us; 
and thou hast betaken us in the hands of enemies, wicked men, and worst trespassers, and to the unjust king, and worst over all earth. 
And now we may not open the mouth; we be made shame and reproof to thy servants, and to them that worship thee. 
We beseech, give thou or betake not us to enemies without end, for thy name, and destroy thou not thy testament, 
and take thou not away thy mercy from us, for Abraham, thy darling or thy dearworthy, and Isaac, thy servant, and Israel, or Jacob, thine holy; 
to which thou spakest, promising that thou shouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as gravel which is in the brink of the sea. 
For why, Lord, we be made little, more than all folks or all heathen men, and we be low in all earth today or we be meek in each land this day, for our sins. 
And in this time is no prince or there is not in this time prince, and duke, and prophet, neither burnt sacrifice, neither sacrifice, neither offering, neither incense, neither place of first fruits before thee, that we may find thy mercy; 
but be we received in contrite soul, and in spirit of meekness. 
As in burnt sacrifice of rams, and of bulls, and as in thousands of fat lambs, so our sacrifice be made today in thy sight, that it please thee; for no shame or confusion is to them that trust in thee. 
And now we pursue thee in all the heart, and we dread thee, and we seek thy face. 
Shame thou not us, but do with us by or after thy mildness, and by or after the multitude of thy mercy. 
And deliver thou us in thy marvels, and give thou glory to thy name, Lord; and all men be ashamed, that show evils to thy servants; 
be they shamed in all thy might or power, and the strength of them be all-broken or broken altogether; 
and they shall know, that thou art the Lord God alone, and glorious on the roundness of lands or of earths. 
And the ministers of the king, that had sent them, ceased not to make hot the furnace with cement or with naphtha, and hards of flax or of hemp, and pitch, and scions or cuttings of vines. 
And the flame was shed or poured out over the furnace by nine and forty cubits, 
and brake out, and burnt them that it found of Chaldees beside the furnace. and brake out, and burnt whom of Chaldees it found beside the furnace. 
Forsooth the angel of the Lord came down with Azariah and his fellows, into the furnace, and smote out the flame of the fire from the furnace; 
and made the midst of the furnace as the wind of dew blowing; and utterly the fire touched not them, neither made sorry or sorrowful, neither did anything of dis-ease or brought in anything of heaviness. 
Then these three as of one mouth praised and glorified God, and blessed God in the furnace, and said, 
Lord God of our fathers, thou art blessed or Blessed are thou, Lord God of our fathers, and worthy to be praised, and glorious, and above enhanced into worlds; 
and blessed is the name of thy glory, which name is holy, and worthy to be praised, and above enhanced or raised into all worlds.
