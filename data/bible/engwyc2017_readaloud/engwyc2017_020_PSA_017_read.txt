Chapter 17.
The prayer of David. Lord, hear thou my rightfulness; behold thou my prayer. Perceive thou with ears my prayer; not made in guileful lips. 
My doom come forth of thy cheer; thine eyes see they equity. 
Thou hast proved mine heart, and hast visited me in the night; thou hast examined, or assayed, me by fire, and wickedness is not found in me. 
That my mouth speak not of the works of men; for the words of thy lips I have kept hard ways. 
Make thou perfect my goings in thy paths; that my steps be not moved. 
I cried, for thou, God, heardest me; bow down thy ear to me, and hear thou my words. 
Make wonderful thy mercies; that makest safe them that hope in thee. 
Keep thou me as the apple of thine eye; and from them that against-stand thy right hand. Cover thou me under the shadow of thy wings; 
from the face of unpious men, that have tormented me. Mine enemies have encompassed my soul; 
they have closed together their fatness; the mouth of them spake pride. 
They casted me forth, and have en-compassed me now; they ordained to bow down their eyes into the earth. 
They, as a lion made ready to his prey, have taken me; and as the whelp of a lion dwelling in hid places. 
Lord, rise thou up, before come thou him, and deceive or overturn thou him; deliver thou my life from the unpious, deliver thou thy sword; 
from the enemies of thine hand. Lord, part thou them from a few men of the land in the life of them; their womb is full-filled of thine hid things. They be full-filled with sons; and they left their remnants, either residue, to their little children. 
But I in rightfulness or rightwise-ness shall appear to thy sight; I shall be ful filled, when thy glory shall appear.
