JEREMIAH.
Chapter 45.
The word that Jeremy, the prophet, spake to Baruch, the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in the book, of the mouth of Jeremy, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and said, 
The Lord God of Israel saith these things to thee, Baruch. 
Thou saidest, Woe to me wretch, for the Lord increased sorrow to my sorrow; I travailed in my wailing, and I found not rest. 
The Lord saith these things, Thus thou shalt say to him, Lo! I destroy them, which I builded, and I draw out them, which I planted, and all this land. 
And seekest thou great things to thee? do not thou seek, for lo! I shall bring evil on each man, saith the Lord, and I shall give to thee thy life into health, in all places, to which ever places thou shalt go.
