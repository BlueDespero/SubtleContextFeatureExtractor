Chapter 48.
The song of psalm, of the sons of Korah. The Lord is great, and worthy to be praised full much; in the city of our God, in the holy hill of him. 
It is founded in the full out joying of all earth; the hill of Zion, the sides of the north, the city of the great king. 
God shall be known in the houses thereof; when he shall take it. 
For lo! the kings of earth were gathered together; they came into one place. 
They seeing, so wondered; they were troubled, they were moved altogether, 
trembling took them. There sorrows, as of a woman travailing of child; 
in a great spirit thou shalt all-break the ships of Tarshish. 
As we heard, so we saw, in the city of the Lord of virtues, in the city of our God; God hath founded that city without end. 
God, we have received thy mercy; in the midst of thy temple. 
After thy name, God, so thy praising is spread abroad into the ends of earth; thy right hand is full of rightwiseness. 
The hill of Zion be glad, and the daughters of Judah be fully joyful or full out joy; for thy dooms, Lord. 
Compass ye Zion, and embrace ye it; tell ye in the towers thereof. 
Set ye your hearts in the virtue of him; and part ye the houses of him, that ye tell out in another generation. 
For this is God, our God, into without end, and into the world of world; he shall govern us into worlds.
