Chapter 110.
The psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord; Sit thou on my right side. Till I put thine enemies a stool of thy feet. 
The Lord shall send out from Zion the rod of thy virtue; be thou lord in the midst of thine enemies. 
The beginning is with thee in the day of thy virtue, in the brightnesses of saints; I begat thee of the womb, before the day star. 
The Lord swore, and it shall not repent him; Thou art a priest without end, by the order of Melchizedek. 
The Lord on thy right side; hath broken kings in the day of his venge-ance. 
He shall deem among nations, he shall fill the land with fallings; he shall shake heads in the land of many men. 
He drank of the strand or stream in the way; therefore he enhanced the head.
