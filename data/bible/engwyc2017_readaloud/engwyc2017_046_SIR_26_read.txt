Chapter 26.
The husband of a good woman is blessed; for why the number of their years is double. Blessed is the man of a good woman; the number forsooth of the years of him double. 
A strong woman, that is, against sins, delighteth her husband; and he shall ful fill in peace the years of his life. 
A good woman is a good partner; in the good part of them that dread God, she shall be given to a man for his good deeds. 
Forsooth if the heart of a rich man and of a poor man is good; in all time their cheer is glad. 
Mine heart dreaded of three things, and my face dreaded or was afeared in the fourth thing. Betraying of a city, and the gathering together of people, that is, in conspiring of the people against the prince, and false challenge; all these things be more grievous on or than death. 
The sorrow of heart, and mourning, is a jealous woman. In a jealous woman is beating of tongue, and she communeth with all men or In a jealous woman scourge of tongue, to all communing. 
As a yoke of oxes or oxen which is moved, so and a wicked woman; he that holdeth her, is as he that taketh or caught a scorpion. 
A drunken woman is great ire or wrath, and despising or strife; and her filthhood shall not be covered. 
The fornication of a woman is in the raising of her eyes; and she shall be known in the eyelids of her. 
Make thou firm the keeping in a daughter not turning away herself; lest she mis-use herself, if she findeth occasion. 
Be thou ware of all unreverence of her eyes; and wonder thou not, if she despiseth thee. 
As a way-goer thirsting shall open the mouth at a well, and shall drink of each water next; and the foresaid daughter shall sit against each pale, and shall open the arrow case against each arrow or against all arrows shall open the quiver, till she fail. 
The grace of a busy woman shall delight her husband or her man; and shall make fat his bones. 
The knowing of her is the gift of God. A wise woman and a still is not the exchanging of a learned or the taught soul. 
Grace up on grace is an holy woman, and shamefast. Forsooth all weighing is not worth a continent soul. 
As the sun rising in the world in the highest things of God, so the fairness of a good woman is into the ornament, or the adornment or adorning of her house. 
A lantern shining up on an holy candlestick, and the fairness of a face on steadfast or stable age, that is, as such a lantern lighteneth the church, and such a face maketh fair ripe age, so a good woman maketh fair her house. 
Golden pillars on silvern founda-ments, and steadfast feet on the soles of a steadfast or stable woman. Ever-lasting foundaments on a firm stone, and the behests or commandments of God in the heart of an holy woman.

In two things mine heart was made sorry or sorrowful, and in the third thing wrathfulness came to me. A man warrior failing by neediness, and a wise man despised. And God hath made him ready to the sword, that passeth over from rightfulness or over-goeth from rightwiseness to sin. 
Two species appeared hard and perilous to me; a merchant is de-livered of hard from his negligence, and a taverner shall not be justified of or from sins of lips.
