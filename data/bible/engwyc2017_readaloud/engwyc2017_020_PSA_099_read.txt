Chapter 99.
The Lord hath reigned, the peoples be wroth; thou that sittest on cherubim, the earth be moved. 
The Lord is great in Zion; and high above all peoples. 
Acknowledge they to thy great name, for it is fearedful and holy; 
and the honour of the king loveth doom. Thou hast made ready dress-ings or rightforth rulings; thou hast made doom and rightfulness or right-wiseness in Jacob. 
Enhance ye our Lord God; and worship ye at the stool of his feet, for it is holy. 
Moses and Aaron were among his priests; and Samuel was among them that inwardly call his name. They inwardly called the Lord, and he heard them; 
in a pillar of cloud he spake to them. They kept his witnessings; and the commandment which he gave to them. 
Our Lord God, thou heardest them; God, thou were merciful to them, and thou tookest vengeance on all their findings. 
Enhance ye our Lord God, and worship ye in his holy hill; for our Lord God is holy.
