JOB.
Chapter 17.
My spirit shall be made feeble; my days shall be made short, and only the sepulchre is left to me. 
I have not sinned, and mine eye dwelleth in bitternesses. 
Lord, deliver thou me, and set or put me beside thee; and the hand of each man fight against me. 
Thou hast made the heart of them far from doctrine, that is, from know-ing of truth; therefore they shall not be enhanced. 
He promiseth prey to his fellows, and the eyes of his sons shall fail. 
He hath set or put me as into a proverb of the common people, and his ensample before them. 
Mine eye dimmed at the indig-nation; and my members be driven as into nought. 
Just or rightwise men shall wonder on this thing; and an innocent shall be raised up against an hypocrite. 
And a just or rightwise man shall hold his way, and he shall add strength to clean hands. 
Therefore all ye be turned again, and come ye; and I shall not find in you any wise man. 
My days be passed; my thoughts be scattered, tormenting mine heart. 
Those or they have turned the night into day; and again after dark-nesses hope for light. 
If I sustain, either suffer patiently, hell is mine house; and I have arrayed my bed in darknesses. 
I said to rot, Thou art my father; and to worms, Ye be my mother, and my sister. 
Therefore where is now mine abiding? and who beholdeth my patience? 
All my things shall go down into the deepest hell; guessest thou, whether rest shall be to me, namely there.
