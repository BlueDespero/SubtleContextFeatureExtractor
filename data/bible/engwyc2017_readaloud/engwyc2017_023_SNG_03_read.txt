Chapter 3.
In my little bed, I sought him by nights, whom my soul loveth; I sought him, and I found not. 
So I said, I shall rise, and I shall compass the city, by little streets and large streets; I shall seek him, whom my soul loveth; I sought him, and I found not. 
Watchmen, that keep the city, found me. I asked, Whether ye saw him, whom my soul loveth? 
A little when I had passed them, I found him, whom my soul loveth; I held him, and I shall not leave him, till I bring him into the house of my mother, and into the bed-closet of my mother. 
Ye daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you greatly, by the caprets, and harts of fields, that ye raise not, neither make to awake the dearworthy spousess, till she will. 
Who is this woman, that goeth up by the desert, as a rod of smoke of sweet smelling spices, of myrrh, and of incense, and of all powder of an ointment maker? 
Lo! sixty strong men of the strongest men of Israel encompass the bed of Solomon; 
and all they hold swords, and be most witting to battles; the sword of each man is on his hip, for the dread of nights. 
King Solomon made to him a seat, of the wood of Lebanon; 
he made the pillars thereof of silver; he made a golden resting place, a going up of purple; and he arrayed the middle things with charity, for the daughters of Jerusalem. 
Ye daughters of Zion, go out, and see king Solomon in the diadem, with which his mother crowned him, in the day of his espousing, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
