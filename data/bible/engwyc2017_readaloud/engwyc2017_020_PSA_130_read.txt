Chapter 130.
The song of degrees. Lord, I cried to thee from the depths; 
Lord, hear thou my voice. Thine ears be made attentive into the voice of my beseeching. 
Lord, if thou keepest wickednesses; Lord, who shall sustain, or abide? 
For mercy is at thee; 
and, Lord, for thy law I abode thee. My soul sustained in his word; 
my soul hoped in the Lord. From the morrowtide keeping till to the night; 
Israel hope in the Lord. For why mercy is at the Lord; and plenteous redemption is at him. 
And he shall again-buy Israel; from all the wickednesses thereof.
