EZEKIEL.
Chapter 19.
And thou, son of man, take wailing on the princes of Israel; 
and thou shalt say, Why thy mother, a lioness, lay among lions? In the midst of little lions she nourished her whelps, 
and led out one of her little lions; he was made a lion, and he learned to take prey, and to eat men. 
And heathen men heard of him, and took him not without their wounds; and they brought him in chains into the land of Egypt. 
Which mother when she had seen, that she was sick, and the abiding of him perished, took another one of her little lions, and made him a lion. 
Which went among lions, and was made like a young lion; and he learned to take prey, and to devour men. 
He learned to make widows, and to bring the cities of men into desert; and the land and the fullness thereof was made desolate, of the voice of his roaring. 
And heathen men came together against him on each side from provinces, and spread on him their net; he was taken in the wounds of those heathen men. 
And they sent him into a cave in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon; and they sent him into prison, that his voice were no more heard on the hills of Israel. 
Thy mother as a vinery or vine-yard in thy blood was planted on water; the fruits thereof and the boughs thereof increased by reason of many waters. 
And firm rods were made to it into sceptres of lords, and the stature thereof was enhanced among boughs; and it saw his highness in the multitude of his scions. 
And it was drawn out in wrath, and was cast forth into the earth; and a burning wind dried the fruit thereof, and the rods of strength thereof withered, and were made dry, and the fire ate it. 
And now it is planted over in desert, in a land without a way, and thirsty. 
And fire went out of a rod of the branches thereof, that ate the fruit thereof. And a strong rod, the sceptre of lords, was not in it. It is wailing, and it shall be into wailing.
