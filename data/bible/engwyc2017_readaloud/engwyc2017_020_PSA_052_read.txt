Chapter 52.
To victory, the psalm of David, when Doeg the Idumaean came, and told to Saul, and said to him, David came into the house of Ahimelech. What hast thou glory in malice; which art mighty in wickedness? 
All day thy tongue thought unright-fulness; as a sharp razor thou hast done guile or treachery. 
Thou lovedest malice more than benignity; and wickedness more than to speak equity. 
Thou lovedest all words of casting down; with a guileful or treacherous tongue. 
Therefore God shall destroy thee into the end, he shall draw thee out by the root, and he shall make thee to pass away from thy tabernacle; and thy root from the land of living men. 
Just or Rightwise men shall see, and shall dread; and they shall laugh on him, 
and they shall say, Lo! the man that setted or put not God his helper. But he hoped in the multitude of his riches; and had mastery in his vanity. 
Forsooth I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God; hoped in the mercy of God without end, and into the world of world. 
I shall acknowledge to thee into the world, for thou hast done mercy to me; and I shall abide thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.
