JEREMIAH.
Chapter 24.
The Lord showed to me, and lo! two panniers full of figs were set before the temple of the Lord, after that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, translated Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of him, and a subtle craftsman, and a goldsmith, from Jerusalem, and brought them into Babylon. 
And one pannier had full good figs, as figs of the first time be wont to be; and one pannier had full evil figs, that might not be eaten, for those or they were evil figs. 
And the Lord said to me, Jeremy, what thing seest thou? And I said, Figs, good figs, full good; and evil figs, full evil, that may not be eaten, for those or they be evil figs. 
And the word of the Lord was made to me, and said, 
The Lord God of Israel saith these things, As these figs be good, so I shall know the transmigration of Judah, which I sent out from this place into the land of Chaldees, into good. 
And I shall set or put mine eyes on them to please, and I shall bring them again into this land; and I shall build them, and I shall not destroy them; and I shall plant them, and I shall not draw up by the root. 
And I shall give to them an heart, that they know me, for I am the Lord; and they shall be into a people to me, and I shall be into God to them, for they shall turn again to me in all their heart. 
And as the worst figs be, that may not be eaten, for those or they be evil figs, the Lord saith these things, So I shall give Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and the princes of him, and other men of Jerusalem, that dwell in this city, and that dwell in the land of Egypt. 
And I shall give them into travailing and torment in all realms of earth, into reproof, and into parable, and into a proverb, and into cursing, in all places to which I casted them out. 
And I shall send in them sword, and hunger, and pestilence, till they be wasted from the land which I gave to them, and to the fathers of them.
