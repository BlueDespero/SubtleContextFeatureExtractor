LEVITICUS.
Chapter 12.
And the Lord spake to Moses, and said, 
Speak thou to the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, If a woman, when she hath received seed, childeth a knave child, she shall be unclean by seven days, by the days of her separating of corruptible blood, that runneth from her by months; 
and the young child shall be circumcised in the eighth day. 
Soothly she shall dwell three and thirty days in the blood of her purifying; she shall not touch any holy thing, neither she shall enter into the saintuary, till the days of her cleansing be ful filled. 
Soothly if she childeth a female, she shall be unclean two weeks, by the custom of the flowing of unclean blood, and threescore and six days she shall dwell in the blood of her cleansing. 
And when the days of her cleansing, for a son, or for a daughter, be fulfilled, she shall bring a lamb of one year into burnt sacrifice, and a culver bird, either a turtle, for sin, to the door of the tabernacle of witnessing; and she shall give to the priest, 
which shall offer those before the Lord, and shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed from the flowing of her blood. This is the law of a woman that childeth male, or female. 
That if her hand find not, neither she may offer a lamb, she shall take two turtles, either two culver birds, one into burnt sacrifice, and the tother for sin; and the priest shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed.
