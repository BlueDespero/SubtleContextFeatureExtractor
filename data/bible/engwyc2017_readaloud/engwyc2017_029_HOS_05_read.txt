HOSEA.
Chapter 5.
Priests, hear ye this, and the house of Israel, perceive ye, and the house of the king, hearken ye; for why doom is to you, for ye be made a snare to looking afar, and as a net spread abroad on Tabor. 
And ye bowed down sacrifices into depth; and I am the learner of all them. 
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now Ephraim did fornication, Israel is defouled. 
They shall not give their thoughts that they turn again to their God; for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they knew not the Lord. 
And the boast of Israel shall answer into the face thereof, and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their wickedness; also Judah shall fall with them. 
In their flocks and in their droves, they go to seek the Lord, and they shall not find; he is taken away from them. 
They trespassed against the Lord, for they engendered alien sons; now the month shall devour them with their parts. 
Sound ye with a clarion in Gibeah, with a trump in Ramah; yell ye in Bethaven, after thy back, Benjamin. 
Ephraim shall be into desolation, in the day of amending, and in the lineages of Israel I showed faith. 
The princes of Judah be made as those taking over the term; I shall shed out on them my wrath as water. 
Ephraim suffereth false challenge, and is broken by doom; for he began to go after filths. 
And I am as a moth to Ephraim, and as rot to the house of Judah. 
And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his bond. And Ephraim went to Assur, and sent to the king avenger. And he may not save you, neither he may unbind the bond from you. 
For I am as a lioness to Ephraim, and as a whelp of a lion to the house of Judah. I myself shall take, and go, and take away, and none is that shall deliver. 
I shall go, and turn again to my place, till ye fail, and seek my face. In their tribulation they shall rise early to me.
