Chapter 58.
To victory, lose thou not the sweet song, either the seemly psalm, of David. Forsooth if ye speak rightfulness or rightwiseness verily; ye sons of men, deem rightfully or evenly. 
For in heart ye work wickedness in earth; your hands make ready unrightfulnesses or unrightwisenesses. 
Sinners were made aliens from the womb; they erred from the womb, they spake false things. 
Strong vengeance is to them, by the likeness of a serpent; as of a deaf snake, and stopping his ears. 
Which shall not hear the voice of charmers; and of a venom-maker charming ever so wisely. 
God shall all-break the teeth of them in their mouth; the Lord shall break altogether the great teeth of lions. 
They shall come to nought, as water running away; he bent his bow, till they be made sick. 
As wax that floateth or floweth away, they shall be taken away; fire fell above, and they saw not the sun. 
Before that your thorns understood the rhamn, either thieve-thorn; he swalloweth them so in ire, as with living men. 
The just or rightwise man shall be glad, when he shall see vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of a sinner. 
And a man shall say truly, For fruit is to a just or rightwise man; truly God is deeming them in earth.
