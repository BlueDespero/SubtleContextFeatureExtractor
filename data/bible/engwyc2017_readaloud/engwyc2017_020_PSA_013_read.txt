PSALMS.
Chapter 13.
To the victory, the psalmof David. Lord, how long forgettest thou me, into the end? how long turnest thou away thy face from me? 
How long shall I set counsel in my soul; sorrow in my heart by day? How long shall mine enemy be raised up on me? 
My Lord God, behold thou, and hear thou me. Lighten thou mine eyes, lest any time I sleep in death; 
lest any time mine enemy say, I had the mastery against him. They, that trouble me, shall have joy, if I shall be stirred; 
but I hoped in thy mercy. Mine heart shall fully have joy in thine health; 
I shall sing to the Lord, that giveth goods to me, and I shall say psalm to the name of the highest Lord.
