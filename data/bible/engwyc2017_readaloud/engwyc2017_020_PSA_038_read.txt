Chapter 38.
The psalm of David, to bethink on the sabbath. Lord, reprove thou not me in thy strong vengeance; neither chastise thou me in thine ire. 
For thine arrows be fixed in me; and thou hast made steadfast thine hand on me. 
None health is in my flesh from the face of thine ire; no peace is to my bones from the face of my sins. 
For my wickednesses be gone over mine head; as an heavy burden, those or they be made heavy on me. 
Mine healed wounds were rotten, and be broken; from the face of mine unwisdom. 
I am made a wretch, and I am bowed down till into the end; all day I entered sorrowful. 
For my loins be filled with scorn-ings; and health is not in my flesh. 
I am tormented, and made low full greatly; I roared for the wailing of mine heart. 
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my wailing is not hid from thee. 
Mine heart is troubled in me, my virtue forsook me; and the light of mine eyes, and it is not with me. 
My friends and my neighbours nighed; and stood against me. And they that were beside me stood afar; 
and they did violence, that sought my life. And they that sought evils to me, spake vanities; and thought guiles or treacheries all day. 
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and as a dumb man not opening his mouth. 
And I am made as a man not hearing; and not having reprovings in his mouth. 
For, Lord, I hoped in thee; my Lord God, thou shalt hear me. 
For I said, Hear me, Lest any time mine enemies have joy on me; and the while my feet be moved/and while my feet were moved, they spake great things on me. 
For I am ready to beatings; and my sorrow is evermore in my sight. 
For I shall tell my wickedness; and I shall think for my sin. 
But mine enemies live, and they be confirmed on me; and they be multiplied, that hate me wickedly. 
They that yield evils for goods, backbited me; for I pursued or followed goodness. 
My Lord God, forsake thou not me; go thou not away from me. 
Lord God of mine health; behold thou into mine help.
