promising for their brethren, the principal men of them, and they that came thither to promise, and to swear, that they should go in the law of the Lord, which he gave by the hand of Moses, his servant, and that they should do and keep all the behests of the Lord our God, and his dooms, and his ceremonies; 
and that we should not give our daughters to the people of the land, and that we should not take their daughters to our sons. 
Also the peoples of the land, that bring in things set to sale, and all things to use, by the day of sabbath, for to sell, we shall not take of them in the sabbath, and in a day hallowed; and we shall leave the land without tilth and sowing and gathering, the seventh year, and the asking of all hand, that is, release debts, and deliver Hebrew servants. 
And also we shall ordain upon us commandments, that by each year we give the third part of a shekel to the work of the Lord our God, 
to the loaves of setting forth, and to the everlasting sacrifice, and into burnt sacrifice everlasting, in sabbaths, in calends, that is, beginnings of months, in solemnities, in hallowed days, and for sin, that prayer be made for Israel, and into all the uses of the house of our God. 
Also we casted lots on the offering of wood, betwixt priests and deacons or Levites and the people, that those or they should be brought into the house of our God, by the meines of our fathers in certain times, from the times of a year sufficient unto a year, that that wood should burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law of Moses; 
and that we bring the first engen-dered things of our land, and the first fruits of all fruit of each tree, from year into year, into the house of the Lord, 
and the first begotten things of our sons, and of our beasts, as it is written in the law, and the first begotten things of our oxen, and of our sheep, that those or they be offered in the house of our God, to priests that minister in the house of our God; 
and we shall bring the first fruits of our meats, and of our moist or liquor sacrifices, and the fruits of each tree, and of vintage, and of oil, to the priests, at the chamber of the house of the Lord, and the tenth part of our land to deacons or Levites; those deacons shall take tithes of all the cities of our works. 
And a priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the deacons or Levites in the tithes of deacons; and the deacons shall offer the tenth part of their tithe in the house of our God, at the chambers, in the house of treasure. 
For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the first fruits of wheat, of wine, and of oil to that place; and hallowed vessels shall be there, and priests, and singers, and porters, and ministers; and we shall not forsake the house of our God.
