PSALMS.
Chapter 101.
The psalm of David. Lord, I shall sing to thee; mercy and doom. I shall sing, 
and I shall understand in a way without wem; when thou shalt come to me. I went perfectly in the inno-cence of mine heart; in the middle of mine house. 
I setted not forth before mine eyes an unjust thing; I hated them that made trespassings. 
A shrewd heart cleaved not to me; I knew not a wicked man bowing away from me. 
I pursued him that backbited privily his neighbour. With the proud eye and an heart unable to be filled; I ate not with this. 
Mine eyes were to the faithful men of earth, that they sit with me; he that went in a way without wem, ministered or served to me. 
He that doeth pride, shall not dwell in the middle of mine house; he that speaketh wicked things, served not in the sight of mine eyes. 
In the morrowtide I killed all the sinners of earth; that I should lose from the city of the Lord all men working wickedness.
