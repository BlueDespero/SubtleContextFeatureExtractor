ZECHARIAH.
Chapter 5.
And I was converted, and raised mine eyes, and saw, and lo! a book flying. 
And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, Lo! I see a book flying; the length thereof was of twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof of ten cubits. 
And he said to me, This is the curse, that goeth on the face of all earth; for each thief shall be deemed, as it is written there; and each man swearing falsely shall be deemed of this also. 
I shall lead out it, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall come to the house of a thief, and to the house of him that sweareth falsely in my name; and it shall dwell in the middle of his house, and shall waste him, and his trees, and his stones. 
And the angel went out, that spake in me, and said to me, Raise up thine eyes, and see, what this thing is that goeth out. 
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an amphora, either a pot, going out. And he said, This is the eye of them in all earth. 
And lo! a talent of lead was borne up from it; and lo! a woman sitting in middle of the pot. 
And he said, This is unpiety, either unfaithfulness. And he casted down her in the middle of the pot, and sent a gobbet of lead into the mouth thereof. 
And I raised mine eyes, and saw, and lo! two women going out, and a spirit in the wings of them; and they had wings as the wings of a kite, and raised the pot betwixt heaven and earth. 
And I said to the angel that spake in me, Whither bear these the pot? 
And he said to me, That an house be builded thereto in the land of Shinar, and be stablished, and set there on his foundament.
