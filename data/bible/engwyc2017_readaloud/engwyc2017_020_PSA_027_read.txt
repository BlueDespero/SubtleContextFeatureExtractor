Chapter 27.
The holy prayer of David. The Lord is my lightening, and mine health; whom shall I dread? The Lord is defender of my life; for whom shall I tremble or quake? 
The while noisome men nigh on me; for to eat my fleshes. Mine enemies, that troubled me; they were made sick and felled or fell down. 
Though castles or tents stand together against me; mine heart shall not dread. Though battle riseth against me; in this thing I shall have hope. 
I asked of the Lord one thing; I shall seek this thing; that I dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I see the will of the Lord; and that I visit his temple. 
For he hid me in his tabernacle in the day of evils; he defended me in the hid place of his tabernacle. He enhanced me in a stone; 
and now he enhanced mine head over mine enemies. I compassed, and offered in his tabernacle a sacrifice of crying out; I shall sing, and I shall say psalm to the Lord. 
Lord, hear thou my voice, by which I cried to thee; have thou mercy on me, and hear me. 
Mine heart said to thee, My face sought thee; Lord, I shall seek again thy face. 
Turn thou not away thy face from me; bow thou not away in wrath from thy servant. Lord, be thou mine helper, forsake thou not me; and, God, mine health, despise thou not me. 
For my father and my mother have forsaken me; but the Lord hath taken me up. 
Lord, set thou a law to me in thy way; and dress thou me in a rightful or right path, for mine enemies. 
Betake thou not me into the souls of them, that trouble me; for wicked witnesses have risen against me, and wickedness lied to itself. 
I believe to see the goods of the Lord; in the land of living men. 
Abide thou the Lord, do thou manly; and thine heart be comforted, and suffer thou for the Lord.
