Chapter 95.
Come ye, make ye full out joy to the Lord; heartily sing we to God, our health. 
Before-occupy we his face in acknowledging; and heartily sing we to him in psalms. 
For God is a great Lord, and a great King above all gods; for the Lord shall not put away his people. 
For all the ends of the earth be in his hand; and the highness, or the heights, of hills be his. 
For the sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. 
Come ye, praise we, and fall we down before God; weep we before the Lord that made us; 
for he is our Lord God. And we be the people of his pasture; and the sheep of his hand. If ye have heard his voice today; 
do not ye make hard your hearts. As in the stirring to wrath; by the day of temptation in desert. 
Where your fathers tempted me; they proved and saw my works. 
Forty years I was offended to this generation; and I said, Evermore they err in heart. And these men knew not my ways; 
to whom I swore in mine ire, they shall not enter into my rest.
