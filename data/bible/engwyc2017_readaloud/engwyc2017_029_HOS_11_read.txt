HOSEA.
Chapter 11.
For Israel was a child, and I loved him; and from Egypt I called my son. 
They called them, so they went away from the face of them. They offered to Baalim, and made sacrifice to simulacra. 
And I as a nurse of Ephraim bare them in mine arms, and they knew not, that I kept them. 
I shall draw them in the ropes of Adam, in the bonds of charity. And I shall be to them as he that enhanceth the yoke on the cheeks of them; and I bowed down to him that he should eat. 
He shall not turn again into the land of Egypt. And Assur, he shall be king of him, for they would not turn again to me. 
A sword began in the cities thereof, and it shall waste the chosen men thereof, and shall eat the heads of them. 
And my people shall hang, at my coming again. But a yoke shall be put to them altogether, that shall not be taken away. 
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? shall I defend thee, Israel? how shall I give thee up? As Admah I shall set thee; as Zeboiim. Mine heart is turned within me; my repentance is disturbed or troubled altogether. 
I shall not do the strong vengeance of my wrath. I shall not turn, to lose Ephraim; for I am God, and not man. I am Holy in the midst of thee, and I shall not enter into a city. 
They shall go after the Lord. He shall roar as a lion, for he shall roar, and the sons of the sea shall dread. 
And they shall fly away as a bird from Egypt, and as a culver from the land of Assyrians. And I shall set them in their houses, saith the Lord. 
Ephraim compassed me in denying, the house of Israel in guile. But Judah a witness went down with God, and with faithful saints.
