ECCLESIASTICUS.
Chapter 20.
There is false reproving in the ire of a man full of despising or There is lying correction in wrath of the wrongful; and there is doom which is not proved to be good; and there is a still man, and he is prudent. 
It is full good to reprove, more than to be wroth, and to forbid not a man acknowledging in prayer. 
The covetousness or lust of a gelding hath defouled or deflowered the maidenhood of a young woman, so he that maketh wicked doom by violence or so he that doeth by force wicked doom. 
It is full good, that a man that is reproved, show openly penance or How good it is, the chastised to show penance; for so thou shalt escape willful sin. 
There is a still man, which is found wise; and he that is hateful, which is fool-hardy or greedy to speak. 
Soothly there is a still man, not having wit of speech; and there is a still man, knowing the season of covenable time. 
A wise man shall be still till to the right time; but a jolly man or the reckless, or wild and an unprudent man shall not keep time. 
He that useth many words, hurteth his soul; and he that taketh power to himself unjustly or wrong-fully, shall be hated. 
There is going forth in evils to a man unlearned or undisciplined; and there is finding into impairing or into harm. 
There is a gift, which is not profit-able; and there is a gift, whose yielding is double. 
There is making less for glory; and there is a man, which shall raise the head from meekness. 
There is a man, that again-buyeth many sinsor things for little price, and restoreth those or them in sevenfold. 
A wise man in words maketh himself amiable or lovable; but the graces of fools shall be shed or poured out. 
The gift of an unwise man shall not be profitable to thee; for his eyes be sevenfold, that is, his intent is manyfold and diverse. 
He shall give little things or Few things he shall give, and he shall upbraid many things; and the opening of his mouth is enflaming. Today a man lendeth, and tomorrow he asketh forit; and such a man is hateful. 
A friend shall not be to a fool, and grace shall not be to his goods. For they that eat his bread, be of false tongue, that is, flatterers praising his follies; 
how often, and how many men shall scorn him? For he parteth or dealed not by even wit that, that was worthy to be had; in like manner and that, that was not worthy to be had. 
The falling or sliding of a false tongue is as he that falleth in the pavement; so the falls of evil men shall come hastily. 
A man without grace is as a vain fable; and it shall be customable in the mouth of unlearned men. An unkind man as a vain fable; and it shall be often in the mouth of the undisciplined. 
A parable, that is, a true sentence and great, shall be reproved when it cometh out of the mouth of a fool; for he saith not it or he saith it not in his time. 
There is a man, that is forbidden to do sin, for poverty; and he shall not be pricked in his rest. 
There is a man, that shall lose his soul for shame; and for the un-prudence of a person he shall lose it. Forsooth he shall lose himself for the taking or favouring of a person. 
There is a man, that for shame promiseth to a friend; and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause. 
Leasing is a wicked shame in a man; and it shall be customably or busily in the mouth of unlearned men or the undisciplined. 
Better, that is, less evil, is a thief than the customableness of a man, a leasing-monger or a liar; forsooth both they shall inherit perdition. 
The manners of men leasing-mongers or liarsbe without honour; and their shame is with them without ceasing. 
A wise man in words shall bring forth himself; and a prudent man shall please great men. 
He that worketh his land, shall make high the heap of fruits; and he that worketh rightfulness or right-wiseness, shall be enhanced. Soothly he that pleaseth great men, shall escape wickedness. 
Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges; and as one dumb in the mouth it or he turneth away the chastisings of them. 
Wisdom hid, and treasure unseen, what profit is in ever either? 
He is better, that hideth his unwisdom, than a man that hideth his wisdom.
