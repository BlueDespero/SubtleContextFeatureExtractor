Chapter 62.
To victory, over Jeduthun, the psalm of David. Whether my soul shall not be subject to God; for mine health is of him. 
For why he is both my God, and mine health; mine up-taker, I shall no more be moved. 
How long fall ye on a man? all ye slain; as to a wall bowed, and as a wall of stone without mortar cast down. 
Nevertheless they thought to put away my price, I ran in thirst; with their mouth they blessed, and in their heart they cursed. 
Nevertheless, my soul, be thou subject to God; for my patience is of him. 
For he is my God, and my saviour; mine helper, I shall not pass out. 
Mine health, and my glory is in God; God is the giver of mine help, and mine hope is in God. 
All the gathering together of the people, hope ye in God, pour ye out your hearts before him; God is our helper without end. 
Nevertheless the sons of men be vain; the sons of men be liars in balances, that they deceive of vanity into the same thing. 
Do not ye have hope in wicked-ness, and do not ye covet ravens; if riches be plenteous, do not ye set the heart thereto. 
God spake once, I heard these two things; that power is of God, 
and, thou Lord, mercy is to thee; for thou shalt yield to each man by his works.
