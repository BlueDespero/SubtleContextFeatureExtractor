Chapter 91.
He that dwelleth in the help of the highest God; shall dwell in the protection of God of heaven. 
He shall say to the Lord, Thou art mine up-taker, and my refuge; my God, I shall hope in him. 
For he delivered me from the snare of hunters; and from a sharp word. 
With his shoulders he shall make shadow to thee; and thou shalt have hope under his feathers. His truth shall encompass thee with a shield; 
thou shalt not dread of the night’s dread. Of an arrow flying in the day, 
of a goblin going in darknesses; of assailing, and of a midday fiend. 
A thousand shall fall down from thy side, and ten thousand from thy right side; forsooth it shall not nigh to thee. 
Nevertheless thou shalt behold with thine eyes; and thou shalt see the yielding of sinners. 
For thou, Lord, art mine hope; thou hast set thine help to be the alder Highest. 
Evil shall not come to thee; and a scourge shall not come nigh to thy tabernacle. 
For God hath commanded to his angels of thee; that they keep thee in all thy ways. 
They shall bear thee in the hands; lest peradventure thou hurt thy foot at a stone. 
Thou shalt go upon a snake, and a cockatrice; and thou shalt defoul a lion, and a dragon. 
For God saith, For he hoped in me, I shall deliver him; I shall defend him, for he knew my name. 
He cried to me, and I shall hear him; I am with him in tribulation; I shall deliver him, and I shall glorify him. 
I shall ful fill him with the length of days; and I shall show mine health to him.
