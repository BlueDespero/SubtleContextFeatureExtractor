Chapter 113.
Alleluia. Servants, praise ye the Lord; praise ye the name of the Lord. 
The name of the Lord be blessed; from this time now, and till into the world. 
From the rising of the sun till to the going down; the name of the Lord is worthy to be praised. 
The Lord is high above all folks; and his glory is above heavens. 
Who is as our Lord God, that dwelleth in high things; 
and beholdeth meek things in heaven and in earth? 
Raising a needy man from the earth; and enhancing a poor man from drit. 
That he set him with princes; with the princes of his people. 
Which maketh a barren woman dwell in the house; a glad mother of sons.
