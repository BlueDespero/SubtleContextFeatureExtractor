Chapter 126.
The song of degrees. When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion; we were made as comforted. 
Then our mouth was filled with joy; and our tongue with full out joying. Then they shall say among heathen men; The Lord magnified to do with them. 
The Lord magnified to do with us; we be made glad. 
Lord, turn thou our captivity; as a strand or stream in the south. 
They that sow in tears; shall reap in full out joying. 
They going, went, and wept; sending their seeds. But they coming, shall come with full out joying; bearing their handfuls.
