ISAIAH.
Chapter 12.
And thou shalt say in that day, Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee, for thou were wroth to me; thy strong vengeance is turned, and thou hast comforted me. 
Lo! God is my saviour, I shall do faithfully, and I shall not dread. For why the Lord is my strength and my praising, and he is made to me into health. 
Ye shall draw waters with joy of the wells of the saviour. 
And ye shall say in that day, Acknowledge ye to the Lord, and call ye his name into help; make ye known his findings among peoples; have ye mind, that his name is high. 
Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath done worshipfully; tell ye this out in all the earth. 
Thou dwelling of Zion, make full out joy, and praise; for why the Holy of Israel is great in the midst of thee.
