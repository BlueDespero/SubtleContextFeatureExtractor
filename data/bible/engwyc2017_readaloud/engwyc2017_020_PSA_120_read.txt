Chapter 120.
The song of degrees. When I was set in tribulation, I cried to the Lord; and he heard me. 
Lord, deliver thou my soul from wicked lips; and from a guileful tongue. 
What shall be given to thee, either what shall be laid to thee; to a guileful or treacherous tongue? 
Sharp arrows of the mighty; with coals that make desolate. 
Alas to me! for my dwelling in an alien land is made long, I dwelled with men dwelling in Kedar; 
my soul was much time a come-ling. I was peaceable with them that hated peace; 
when I spake to them, they impugned, either against-said, me with-out cause.
