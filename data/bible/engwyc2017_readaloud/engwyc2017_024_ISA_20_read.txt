ISAIAH.
Chapter 20.
In the year wherein Tartan entered into Ashdod, when Sargon, the king of Assyrians, had sent him, and he had fought against Ashdod, and had taken it; 
in that time the Lord spake in the hand of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, and said, Go thou, and unbind the sack-cloth from thy loins, and take away thy shoes from thy feet. And he did so, going naked and unshod. 
And the Lord said, As my servant Isaiah went naked and unshod, a sign and great wonder of three years shall be on Egypt, and on Ethiopia; 
so the king of Assyrians shall drive the captivity of Egypt, and the passing over of Ethiopia, a young man and an eld or old man, naked and unshod, with the buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
And they shall dread, and shall be ashamed of Ethiopia, their hope, and of Egypt, their glory. 
And a dweller of this isle shall say on that day, This was our hope, to which we fled for help, that they should deliver us from the face of the king of Assyrians; and how may we escape?
