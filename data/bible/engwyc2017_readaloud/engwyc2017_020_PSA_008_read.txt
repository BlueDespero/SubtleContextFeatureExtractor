Chapter 8.
To the overcomer, forthepressersor wine presses, the psalm of David. Lord, thou art our Lord; thy name is full wonderful in all the earth. For thy great doing is raised up, above heavens. 
Of the mouth of young children, not speaking and sucking milk, thou hast made perfect praising, for thine enemies; that thou destroy the enemy and the avenger. 
For I shall see thine heavens, the works of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast founded. 
What is a man, that is mankind, that thou art mindful of him; either the son of a virgin or the son of man, for thou visitest him? 
Thou hast made him a little less than angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, 
and thou hast ordained him above the works of thine hands. Thou hast made subject all things under his feet; 
all sheep and oxen, furthermore and the beasts of the field; 
the birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and all the other creatures that pass by the paths of the sea. 
Lord, our Lord; how wonderful is thy name in all the earth.
