Chapter 67.
To victory in organs, the psalm of the song. God have mercy on us, and bless us; lighten he his cheer on us, and have he mercy on us. 
That we know thy way on earth; thine health in all folks. 
God, peoples acknowledge to thee; all peoples acknowledge to thee. 
Heathen men be glad, and make fully joy or and full out joy, for thou deemest peoples in equity; and dressest heathen men in earth. 
God, peoples acknowledge to thee, all peoples acknowledge to thee; 
the earth hath given his fruit. God, our God, bless us, 
God bless us; and all the coasts of earth dread him.
