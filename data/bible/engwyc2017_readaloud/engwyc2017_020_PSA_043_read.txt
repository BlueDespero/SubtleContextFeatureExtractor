Chapter 43.
God, deem thou me, and separate thou my cause from a folk not holy; deliver thou me from a wicked man, and guileful or treacherous. 
For thou art God, my strength; why hast thou put me aback, and why go I sorrowful, while the enemy tormenteth me? 
Send out thy light, and thy truth; those led me forth, and brought me into thine holy hill, and into thy tabernacles. 
And I shall enter to the altar of God; to God, that gladdeth my youth. God, my God, I shall acknowledge to thee in an harp; 
my soul, why art thou sorry, and why troublest thou me? Hope thou in God, for yet I shall acknowledge to him; that is the health of my cheer, and my God.
