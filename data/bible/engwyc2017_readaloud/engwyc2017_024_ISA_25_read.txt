ISAIAH.
Chapter 25.
Lord, thou art my God, I shall enhance thee, and I shall acknowledge to thy name; for thou hast done marvels, thine eld or old faithful thoughts. Amen. 
For thou hast set the city into a burial, a strong city into falling, the house of aliens, that it be not a city, and be not builded without end. 
For this thing a strong people shall praise thee, the city of strong folks shall dread thee. 
For thou art made strength to a poor man, strength to a needy man in his tribulation, hope from the whirlwind, a shadowing place from heat; for why the spirit of strong men is as a whirlwind hurling the wall. 
As by heat in thirst, thou shalt make meek the noise of aliens; and as by heat under a cloud burning, thou shalt make the scions of strong men to fade. 
And the Lord of hosts shall make in this hill to all peoples the feast of fat things, the feast of vintage of fat things full of marrow, of vintage well-refined. 
And he shall cast down in this hill the face of the bond, bound altogether on all peoples, and the web which he weaved on all nations. 
And he shall cast down death into without end, and the Lord God shall do away each tear from each face; and he shall do away the shame of his people from each land, for the Lord spake. 
And they shall say in that day, Lo! this is our God; we abided him, and he shall save us; this is the Lord; we suffered him, and we shall make full out joy, and shall be glad in his health. 
For why the hand of the Lord shall rest in this hill, and Moab shall be threshed under him, as chaffs be stamped in a wain. 
And he shall stretch forth his hands under him, as a swimmer stretcheth forth to swim; and he shall make low the glory of him with the hurtling down of his hands. 
And the strongholds of thine high walls shall fall down, and shall be made low, and shall be drawn down to the earth, till to the dust.
