GALATIANS.
Chapter 6.
Brethren, if a man be occupied in any guilt or overcome in any trespass, ye that be spiritual, inform ye or teach such one in spirit of softness, or meekness, beholding thyself, lest that thou be tempted, falling in the same wise. 
Each bear other’s charges, and so ye shall fulfill the law of Christ. 
For who that troweth or guesseth that he be aught, when he is nought, he beguileth himself. 
But each man prove his own work, and so he shall have glory only in himself, and not in another. 
For each man shall bear his own charge. 
He that is taught in word, commune he with him that teacheth him, in all goods or in all good things. 
Do not ye err, God is not scorned; for those things that a man soweth, those things he shall reap. 
For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption; but he that soweth in the Spirit, of the Spirit he shall reap everlasting life. 
And doing good fail we not; for in his time we shall reap, not failing. 
Therefore while we have time, work we good to all men; but most to them that be home-like or that be the household meine of the faith. 
See ye, what manner letters I have written to you with mine own hand. 
For whoever will please in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised, only that they suffer not the persecution of Christ’s cross. 
For neither they that be circumcised keep the law; but they will, that they have glory in your flesh. 
But far be it from me to have glory, no but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. 
For in Jesus Christ neither circum-cision is anything worth, nor prepuce, but a new creature. 
And whoever shall pursue this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and on Israel of God. 
And hereafter or From hence-forth, no man be heavy to me; for I bear in my body the tokens, or the wounds, of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
