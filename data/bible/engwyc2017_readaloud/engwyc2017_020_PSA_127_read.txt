Chapter 127.
The song of degrees of Solomon. No but or But if the Lord build the house; they that built it have travailed in vain. No but or But if the Lord keepeth the city; he waketh in vain that keepeth it. 
It is vain to you to rise before the light; rise ye after ye have set, that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his loved; 
lo! the heritage of the Lord is sons, the meed is the fruit of the womb. 
As arrows be in the hand of the mighty; so the sons of them that be shaken out. 
Blessed is the man, that hath full-filled his desire of those or them; he shall not be shamed, when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.
