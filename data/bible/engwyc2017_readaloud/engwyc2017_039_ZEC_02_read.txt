ZECHARIAH.
Chapter 2.
And I raised mine eyes, and saw, and lo! a man, and lo! in his hand, a little cord of meters. 
And I said, Whither goest thou? And he said to me, That I mete Jerusalem, and Judah; how much is the breadth thereof, and how much is the length thereof. 
And lo! the angel that spake in me, went out, and another angel went out into the meeting of him, 
and said to him, Run thou, speak to this young man, and say thou, Jerusalem shall be inhabited without wall, for the multitude of men and beasts in the middle thereof. 
And I shall be to it, saith the Lord, a wall of fire in compass; and I shall be in glory in the middle thereof. 
A! A! A! flee ye from the land of the north, saith the Lord, for in four winds of heaven I scattered you, saith the Lord. 
A! thou Zion, flee, that dwellest at the daughter of Babylon. 
For the Lord of hosts saith these things, After glory he sent me to heathen men, which robbed you; for he that shall touch you, shall touch the apple of mine eye. 
For lo! I raise mine hand on them, and they shall be preys to these that served them; and ye shall know, that the Lord of hosts sent me. 
Daughter of Zion, praise thou, and be glad; for lo! I come, and I shall dwell in the middle of thee, saith the Lord. 
And many folks shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and they shall be to me into a people, and I shall dwell in the middle of thee; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts sent me to thee. 
And the Lord shall wield Judah into his part, in the land hallowed, and shall choose yet Jerusalem. 
Each flesh be still from the face of the Lord, for he rose of his holy dwelling place.
