PSALMS.
Chapter 65.
To victory, the psalm of the song of David. God, praising becometh thee in Zion; and a vow shall be yielded to thee in Jerusalem. 
Hear thou my prayer; each man shall come to thee. 
The words of wicked men had the mastery over us; and thou shalt do mercy to our wickednesses. 
Blessed is he, whom thou hast chosen, and hast taken; he shall dwell in thy foreyards. We shall be ful filled with the goods of thine house; thy temple is holy, 
wonderful in equity. God, our health, hear thou us; thou art hope of all coasts of earth, and in the sea afar. 
And thou makest ready hills in thy virtue, and art girded with power; 
which troublest the depth of the sea, the sound of the waves thereof. Folks shall be troubled, 
and they that dwell in the ends shall dread of thy signs; thou shalt delight the outgoings of the morrow-tide and eventide. 
Thou hast visited the land, and hast greatly filled it; thou hast multiplied to make it rich. The flood of God was full-filled with waters; thou madest ready the meat of them, for the making ready thereof is so. 
Thou filling greatly the streams thereof, multiply the fruits thereof; the land bringing forth fruits shall be glad in the gutters of it. 
Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy good will; and thy fields shall be full-filled with plenty of fruits. 
The fair things of desert shall wax fat; and little hills shall be encom-passed with full out joying. 
The wethers of sheep be clothed, and valleys shall be plenteous of wheat; they shall cry out, and soothly they shall say praising or psalm.
