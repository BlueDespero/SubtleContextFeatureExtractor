ISAIAH.
Chapter 4.
And seven women shall catch one man in that day, and shall say, We shall eat our bread, and we shall be covered with our clothes; only thy name be called on us, do thou away our shame. 
In that day the burgeoning of the Lord shall be in great worship and glory; and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and full out joy to them that shall be saved of Israel. 
And it shall be, each that is left in Zion, and is residue in Jerusalem, shall be called holy; each that is written in life in Jerusalem; 
for the Lord washeth away the filths of the daughters of Zion, and washeth the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, in the spirit of doom, and in the spirit of heat. 
And the Lord made on each place of the hill of Zion, and where he was called to help, a cloud by day, and smoke, and brightness of fire flaming in the night; for why covering, either defending, shall be above all glory. 
And a tabernacle shall be into a shadowing place of the day, from heat, and into secureness, and into hiding, from whirlwind and from rain.
