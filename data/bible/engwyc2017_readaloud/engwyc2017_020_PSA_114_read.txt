Chapter 114.
Alleluia. In the going out of Israel from Egypt; of the house of Jacob from the heathen people. 
Judah was made the hallowing of him; Israel the power of him. 
The sea saw, and fled; Jordan was turned aback. 
Mountains full out joyed as rams; and little hills as the lambs of sheep. 
Thou sea, what was to thee, for thou fleddest; and thou, Jordan, for thou were turned aback? 
Mountains, ye made full out joy as rams; and little hills, as the lambs of sheep. 
The earth was moved from the face of the Lord; from the face of God of Jacob. 
Which turned a stone into a pond of waters; and an hard rock into wells of waters.
