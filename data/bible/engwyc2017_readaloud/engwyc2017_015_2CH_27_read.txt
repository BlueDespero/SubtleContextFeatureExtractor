2ND CHRONICLES.
Chapter 27.
Jotham was of five and twenty years, when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; the name of his mother was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
He did that, that was rightful or right before the Lord, by all things which Uzziah, his father, had done; except that he entered not into the temple of the Lord, and the people trespassed yet. 
He builded the high gate of the house of the Lord, and he builded many things in the wall of Ophel; 
also he builded cities in the hills of Judah, and he builded castles and towers in forests or high woods. 
He fought against the king of the sons of Ammon, and overcame him; and the sons of Ammon gave to him in that time an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of barley, and so many of wheat; the sons of Ammon gave these things to him in the second, and the third years. 
And Jotham was made strong, for he had dressed his ways before the Lord his God. 
Forsooth the residue of the words of Jotham, and all his battles, and works, be written in the book of the kings of Israel and of Judah. 
He was of five and twenty years, when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz, his son, reigned for him.
