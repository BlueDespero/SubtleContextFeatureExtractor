Chapter 6.
Thou fairest of women, whither went away thy darling? whither bowed down thy darling? and we shall seek him with thee. 
My darling went down into his orchard, to the garden of sweet smelling spices, that he be fed there in the orchards, and gather lilies. 
I to my darling; and my darling, that is fed among the lilies, be to me. 
My love, thou art fair, sweet and shapely as Jerusalem, thou art fearedful as the battle array of hosts set in good order. 
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they made me to flee away; thine hairs be as the flocks of goats, that appeared from Gilead. 
Thy teeth be as a flock of sheep, that went up from the washing; all be with double lambs, either twins, and no barren there is among them. 
As the rind of a pomegranate, so be thy cheeks, without thy privates. 
Sixty be queens, and eighty be secondary wives; and of young damsels is none number. 
One is my culver, my perfect spousess, one is to her mother, and is the chosen of her mother; the daughters of Zion saw her, and preached her most blessed; queens, and secondary wives, praised her. 
Who is this, that goeth forth, as the morrowtide rising, fair as the moon, chosen as the sun, fearedful as the battle array of hosts set in good order? 
I came down into mine orchard, to see the apples of great valleys, and to behold, if vineries had flowered, and if the pomegranate trees had burgeoned. 
I knew not; my soul troubled me, for the chariots of Amminadib. 
Turn again, turn again, thou Shulamite; turn again, turn again, that we behold thee. What shalt thou see in the Shulamite, but companies of hosts?
