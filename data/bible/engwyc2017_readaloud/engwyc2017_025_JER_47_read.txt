JEREMIAH.
Chapter 47.
The word of the Lord, that was made to Jeremy, the prophet, against Palestines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 
The Lord saith these things, Lo! waters shall ascend or go up from the north, and they shall be as a strand or stream overflowing, and they shall cover the land, and the fullness thereof, the city, and the dwellers thereof. Men shall cry, and all the dwellers of the land shall yell, 
for the noise of boast of armed men, and of warriors of him, and for moving of his carts, and multitude of his wheels. Fathers beheld not sons with benumbed hands, 
for the coming of the day in which all Philistines shall be destroyed; and Tyrus shall be destroyed, and Sidon with all their other helps. For the Lord hath destroyed Palestines, the remnants of the isle of Cappadocia. 
Baldness came on Gaza; Ashkelon was still, and the remnants of the valley of them. How long shalt thou fall down, 
O! sword of the Lord, how long shalt thou not rest? Enter thou into thy sheath, be thou refreshed, and be still. 
How shall it rest, when the Lord commanded to it against Ashkelon, and against the sea coasts thereof, and there he hath said to it?
