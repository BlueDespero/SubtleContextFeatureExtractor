Chapter 134.
The song of degrees. Lo! now bless ye the Lord; all the servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord; in the halls or foreyards of the house of our God. 
In nights raise your hands into holy things; and bless ye the Lord. 
The Lord bless thee from Zion; the which Lord made heaven and earth.
