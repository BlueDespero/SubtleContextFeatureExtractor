PSALMS.
Chapter 79.
The psalm of Asaph. God, heathen men came into thine heritage; they defouled thine holy temple, they setted or put Jerusalem into the keeping of apples. 
They setted or put the slain bodies of thy servants to be meats to the volatiles of heavens; the fleshes of thy saints to the beasts of the earth. 
They shedded out the blood of them, as water in the compass of Jerusalem; and none there was that buried them. 
We be made a shame to our neighbours; mocking and scorning to them, that be in our compass. 
Lord, how long shalt thou be wroth into the end? shall thy vengeance be kindled as fire? 
Pour out thine ire into heathen men, that know not thee; and into realms, that called not thy name. 
For they ate Jacob; and made desolate his place. 
Have thou not mind on our eld or old wickednesses; thy mercies before take us soon, for we be made poor greatly. 
God, our health, help thou us, and, Lord, for the glory of thy name, deliver thou us; and be thou merciful to our sins, for thy name. 
Lest peradventure they say among heathen men, Where is the God of them? and be he known among nations before our eyes. The vengeance of the blood of thy servants, which is shed or poured out; 
the wailing of fettered men enter into thy sight. After the greatness of thine arm; wield thou the sons of slain men. 
And yield thou to our neighbours sevenfold in the bosom of them; the shame of them, which they did shame-fully to thee, thou Lord. 
But we that be thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture; shall acknowledge to thee into the world. In generation and into generation, we shall tell thy praising.
