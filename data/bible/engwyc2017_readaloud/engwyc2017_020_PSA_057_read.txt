PSALMS.
Chapter 57.
To the victory, lose thou not the seemly song, either the sweet song, of David, when he fled from the face of Saul into the den. God, have mercy on me, have thou mercy on me; for my soul trusteth in thee. And I shall hope in the shadow of thy wings; till wickedness pass. 
I shall cry to God alder-highest; to God that did well to me. 
He sent from heaven, and delivered me; he gave into shame them that defoul me. God sent his mercy and his truth, 
and delivered my soul from the midst of whelps of lions; I slept troubled or disturbed. The sons of men, the teeth of them be armours or arms and arrows; and their tongue is a sharp sword. 
God, be thou enhanced above heavens; and thy glory above all earth. 
They made ready a snare to my feet; and they greatly bowed my life. They delved a ditch before my face; and they felled or fell down into it. 
God, mine heart is ready, mine heart is ready; I shall sing, and I shall say psalm. 
My glory, rise thou up; psaltery and harp, rise thou up; I shall rise up early. 
Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee among peoples; and I shall say psalm to thee among heathen men. 
For thy mercy is magnified till to heavens; and thy truth till to the clouds. 
God, be thou enhanced above heavens; and thy glory above all earth.
