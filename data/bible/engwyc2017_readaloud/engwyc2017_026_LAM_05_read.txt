LAMENTATIONS.
Chapter 5.
Lord, have thou mind what befell to us; see thou, and behold our shame. 
Our heritage is turned to aliens, our houses be turned to strangers. 
We be made fatherless children without a father; our mothers be as widows. 
We drank our water for money, we bought our wood for silver. 
We were driven by our heads, and rest was not given to faint men. 
We gave hand to Egypt, and to Assyrians, that we should be ful filled with bread. 
Our fathers sinned, and be not, and we bare the wickednesses of them 
Servants were lords of us, and none was, that again-bought from the hand of them. 
In our lives we brought bread to us, from the face of the sword in desert. 
Our skin is burnt as a furnace, of the face of tempests of hunger. 
They made low women in Zion, and virgins in the cities of Judah. 
Princes were hanged up by the hand; they were not ashamed of the faces of eld or old men. 
They misused young waxing men unchastely, and children fell down in tree. 
Eld or Old men failed from the gates; young men failed from the quire or choir of singers. 
The joy of our heart failed; our song is turned into mourning. 
The crown of our head fell down; woe to us! for we sinned. 
Therefore our heart is made sorrowful, therefore our eyes be made dark. 
For the hill of Zion, for it perished; foxes went in it. 
But thou, Lord, shalt dwell without end; thy seat shall dwell in generation and into generation. 
Why shalt thou forget us without end, shalt thou forsake us into the length of days? 
Lord, convert thou us to thee, and we shall be converted; make thou new our days, as at the beginning. 
But thou casting away hast cast away us; thou art wroth against us greatly.
