Chapter 121.
The song of degrees. I raised mine eyes to the hills; from whence help shall come to me. 
Mine help is of the Lord; that made heaven and earth. 
The Lord give not thy foot into moving; neither he nap, that keepeth thee. 
Lo! he shall not nap, neither sleep; that keepeth Israel. 
The Lord keepeth thee; the Lord is thy protection above thy right hand. 
The sun shall not burn thee by day; neither the moon by night. 
The Lord keep thee from all evil; the Lord keep thy soul. 
The Lord keep thy going in and thy going out; from this time now and into the world.
