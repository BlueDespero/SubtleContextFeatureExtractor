Chapter 125.
The song of degrees. They that trust in the Lord be as the hill of Zion; he shall not be moved without end, that dwelleth in Jerusalem. 
Hills be in the compass of it, and the Lord is in the compass of his people; from this time now, and into the world. 
For the Lord shall not leave the rod of sinners on the part of just or rightwise men; that just men hold not forth their hands to wickedness. 
Lord, do thou well to good men; and to rightful or right in heart. 
But the Lord shall lead them that bow into obligations, with them that work wickedness; peace be upon Israel.
