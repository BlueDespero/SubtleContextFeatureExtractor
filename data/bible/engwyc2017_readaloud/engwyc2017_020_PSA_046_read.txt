Chapter 46.
To the overcomer, the song of the sons of Korah, for youths. Our God, thou art refuge, and virtue; helper in tribulations, that have found us greatly. 
Therefore we shall not dread, while the earth shall be troubled; and the hills shall be borne over into the heart of the sea. 
The waters of them sounded, and were troubled; hills were troubled altogether in the strength of him. 
The fierceness of the flood maketh glad the city of God; the highest God hath hallowed his tabernacle. 
God in the midst thereof shall not be moved; God shall help it early in the gray morrowtide. 
Heathen men were troubled alto-gether, and realms were bowed down; God gave his voice, the earth was moved. 
The Lord of virtues is with us; God of Jacob is our up-taker. 
Come ye, and see the works of the Lord; which wonders he hath set on the earth. 
He doing away battles till to the end of the land; shall all-bruise bow, and he shall break altogether armours or arms, and he shall burn shields with fire. 
Give ye attention, and see ye, that I am God; I shall be enhanced among heathen men; and I shall be enhanced in earth. 
The Lord of virtues is with us; God of Jacob is our up-taker.
