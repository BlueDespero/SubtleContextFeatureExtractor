Chapter 146.
Alleluia. My soul, praise thou the Lord; 
I shall praise the Lord in my life; I shall sing to my God as long as I shall be. 
Do not ye trust in princes; neither in the sons of men, in whom is no health. 
The spirit of him shall go out, and he shall turn again into his earth; in that day all the thoughts of them shall perish. 
He is blessed, of whom the God of Jacob is his helper; his hope is in his Lord God, 
that made heaven, and earth; the sea, and all things that be in those or them. Which keepeth truth into the world, 
he maketh doom to them that suffer wrong; he giveth meat to them that be hungry. The Lord unbindeth fettered men; 
the Lord lighteneth blind men. The Lord raiseth men hurled or hurtled down; the Lord loveth just men. 
The Lord keepeth comelings; he shall take up a motherless child, and a widow; and he shall destroy the ways of sinners. 
The Lord shall reign into the worlds; Zion, thy God shall reign in generation and into generation.
