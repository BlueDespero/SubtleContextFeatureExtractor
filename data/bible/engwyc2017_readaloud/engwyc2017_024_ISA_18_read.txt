ISAIAH.
Chapter 18.
Woe to the land, the cymbal of wings, which is beyond the flood of Ethiopia; 
that sendeth messengers by the sea, and in vessels of papyrus on waters. Go, ye messengers, to the folk drawn up and rent; to a fearedful people, after which is none other; to the folk abiding and defouled, whose land the floods have ravished; to the hill or mount of the name of the Lord of hosts, to the hill or mount of Zion. 
All ye dwellers of the world, that dwell in the land, shall see when a sign shall be raised up in the hills or mountains, and ye shall hear the cry of a trump. 
For why the Lord saith these things to me, I shall rest, and I shall behold in my place, as the midday light is clear, and as a cloud of dew in the day of harvest. 
For why all flowered out before harvest, and unripe perfection burgeoned; and the little branches thereof shall be cut down with scythes, and those that be left, shall be cut away. 
They shall be shaken out, and shall be left together to the birds of hills or mountains, and to the beasts of earth; and birds shall be on him by a summer everlasting, and all the beasts of earth shall dwell by winter on him. 
In that time a gift shall be brought to the Lord of hosts, of the people drawn up and rent; of the people fearedful, after which was none other; of the folk abiding and defouled, whose land floods ravished; the gift shall be brought to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, to the hill or mount of Zion.
