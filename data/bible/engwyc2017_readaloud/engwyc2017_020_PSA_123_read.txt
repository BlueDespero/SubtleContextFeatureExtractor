Chapter 123.
The song of degrees. To thee I have raised mine eyes; that dwellest in heavens. 
Lo! as the eyes of servants be in the hands of their lords. As the eyes of the handmaid be in the hands of her lady; so our eyes be to our Lord God, till he have mercy on us. 
Lord, have thou mercy on us, have thou mercy on us; for we be much filled with despising. 
For our soul is much filled; we be shame to them that be abundant with riches, and despising to proud men.
