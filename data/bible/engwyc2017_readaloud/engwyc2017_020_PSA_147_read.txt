PSALMS.
Chapter 147.
Alleluia. Praise ye the Lord, for the psalm is good; let our praising be merry, and fair to our God. 
The Lord shall build up Jerusalem; and he shall gather together the scatterings of Israel. 
The which Lord maketh whole men contrite in heart; and bindeth together the sorrows of them. 
Which numbereth the multitude of stars; and calleth names to all those or them. 
Our Lord is great, and his virtue is great; and of his wisdom there is no number. 
The Lord taketh up mild men; forsooth he maketh low sinners till to the earth. 
Before sing ye to the Lord in acknowledging; say ye psalm to our God in an harp. 
Which covereth heaven with clouds; and maketh ready rain to the earth. Which bringeth forth hay in hills; and herb to the service of men. 
Which giveth meat to their work beasts; and to the birds of crows calling him. 
He shall not have will in the strength of an horse; neither it shall be well pleasant or well pleased to him in the legs of a man. 
It is well pleasant or well pleased to the Lord on men that dread him; and in them that hope in his mercy. 
Jerusalem, praise thou the Lord; Zion, praise thou thy God. 
For he hath comforted the locks of thy gates; he hath blessed thy sons in thee. 
Which hath set thy coasts peace; and filleth thee with the fatness of wheat. 
Which sendeth out his speech to the earth; his word runneth swiftly. 
Which giveth snow as wool; he spreadeth abroad a cloud as ashes. 
He sendeth his crystal as morsels; who shall be able to suffer before the face of his coldness? 
He shall send out his word, and shall melt those or them; his spirit shall blow, and waters shall flow. 
Which telleth his word to Jacob; and his rightfulnesses and dooms to Israel. 
He did not so to each nation; and he showed not his dooms to them.
