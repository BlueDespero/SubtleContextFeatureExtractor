Chapter 42.
To victory, by the understanding, to the sons of Korah. As an hart desireth to the wells of waters; so thou, God, my soul desireth to thee. 
My soul thirsted to God, the quick well or well of life; when shall I come, and appear before the face of God? 
My tears were loaves to me day and night; while it is said to me each day, Where is thy God? 
I bethought of these things, and I poured out in me my soul; for I shall pass into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, till to the house of God. In the voice of full out joying, and ac-knowledging; is the sound of the eater. 
My soul, why art thou sorry; and why troublest thou me? Hope thou in God, for yet I shall acknowledge to him; he is the health of my cheer, and my God. 
My soul is troubled within myself; therefore, God, I shall be mindful of thee from the land of Jordan, and from the little hill of Hermonites. 
Depth calleth depth; in the voice of thy windows. All thine high things, and thy waves; passed over me. 
The Lord sent his mercy in the day; and his song in the night. With me is the prayer to God of my life; 
I shall say to God, Thou art mine up-taker. Why forgettest thou me; and why go I sorrowful, while the enemy tormenteth me? 
While my bones be broken altogether; mine enemies, that trouble me, despised me. While they say to me, by all days; Where is thy God? 
My soul, why art thou sorry; and why troublest thou me? Hope thou in God, for yet I shall acknowledge to him; he is the health of my cheer, and my God.
