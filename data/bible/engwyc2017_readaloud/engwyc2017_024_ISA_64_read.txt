ISAIAH.
Chapter 64.
I would that thou brakest heavens, and camest down, that hills floated away from thy face, 
and failed or vanish away, as the burning of fire, and waters burnt in or with fire; that thy name were made known to thine enemies, and folks were troubled of thy face. 
When thou shalt do marvels, we shall not abide. Thou camest down, and hills or mountains floated away from thy face. 
From the world they heard not, neither perceived with ears; God, none eye saw, without thee, what things thou hast made ready to them that abide thee. 
Thou mettest him that is glad, and doeth rightfulness or rightwiseness; in thy ways they shall bethink on thee. Lo! thou art wroth, and we sinned; in those sins we were ever, and we shall be saved. 
And all we be made as an unclean man; all our rightfulnesses or rightwisenessesbe as the cloth of a woman in menstruation, or unclean blood; and all we fell down as a leaf, and our wickednesses, as wind, have taken away us. 
None is, that calleth thy name to help, that riseth, and holdeth thee; thou hast hid thy face from us, and thou hast hurtled down us in the hand of our wickedness. 
And now, Lord, thou art our father; forsooth we be clay, and thou art our maker, and all we be the works of thine hands. 
Lord, be thou not wroth enough, and have thou no more mind on our wickedness. Lo! Lord, behold thou, all we be thy people. 
The city of thy holy, either thy saintuary, is forsaken, Zion is made desert, Jerusalem is made desolate; 
the house of our hallowing and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, is made into burning of fire; and all our desirable things be turned into fallings. 
Lord, whether on these things thou shalt withhold thee? shalt thou be still, and shalt thou torment us greatly?
