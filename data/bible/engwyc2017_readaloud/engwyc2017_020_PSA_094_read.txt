Chapter 94.
God is Lord of vengeances; God of vengeance did freely. 
Be thou enhanced that deemest the earth; yield thou yielding to proud men. 
Lord, how long sinners; how long shall sinners have glory? 
They shall tell out, and shall speak wickedness; all men shall speak that work unrightfulness. 
Lord, they have made low thy people; and they have dis-eased thine heritage. 
They killed a widow and a come-ling; and they have slain fatherless children and motherless. 
And they said, The Lord shall not see it; and, God of Jacob shall not understand. 
Ye unwise men in the people, understand; and, ye fools, learn some-time. 
Shall not he hear, that planted the ear; either beholdeth not he, that made the eye? 
Shall not he reprove, that chastiseth folks; shall he not know, which teacheth man knowing? 
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men; that those or they be vain. 
Blessed is the man, whom thou, Lord, hast learned; and hast taught him of thy law. 
That thou assuage him from evil days; till a ditch be digged to the sinner. 
For the Lord shall not put away his people; and he shall not forsake his heritage. 
Till rightfulness or rightwiseness be turned into doom; and who be nigh it, all that be of rightful heart. 
Who shall rise with me against mis-doers; either who shall stand with me against them that work wickedness? 
No but for the Lord helped me; almost my soul had dwelled in hell. 
If I said, My foot was stirred; Lord, thy mercy helped me. 
After the multitude of my sorrows in mine heart; thy comforts made glad my soul. 
Whether the seat of wickedness cleaveth to thee; that makest travail in commandment? 
They shall take hold against the soul of a just or rightwise man; and they shall condemn innocent blood. 
And the Lord was made to me into refuge; and my God was made into the help of mine hope. 
And he shall yield to them the wickedness of them; and in the malice of them he shall lose them, our Lord God shall lose them.
