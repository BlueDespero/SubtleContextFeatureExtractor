Chapter 47.
To victory, a psalm to the sons of Korah. All ye folks, make joy with hands; sing ye heartily to God in the voice of full out joying. 
For the Lord is high and fearedful; a great king on all earth. 
He made peoples subject to us; and heathen men under our feet. 
He chose his heritage to us; the fairness of Jacob, whom he loved. 
God ascended in hearty song; and the Lord in the voice of a trump. 
Sing ye to our God, sing ye; sing ye to our king, sing ye. 
For God is king of all earth; sing ye psalm wisely. 
God shall reign on heathen men; God sitteth on his holy seat. 
The princes of peoples be gath-ered together with God of Abraham; for the strong gods of earth be raised greatly.
