Chapter 24.
The psalm of David. The earth and the fullness thereof is the Lord’s; the world, and all that dwell therein. 
For he founded it on the seas; and made it ready on floods. 
Who shall ascend or go up into the hill of the Lord; either who shall stand in the holy place of him? 
The innocent in hands, that is, in works, and in clean heart; which took not his soul in vain, neither swore in guile to his neighbour. 
He shall take blessing of the Lord; and mercy of God his health. 
This is the generation of men seeking him; of men seeking the face of God of Jacob. 
Ye princes, take up your gates, and ye everlasting gates, be ye raised; and the king of glory shall enter. 
Who is this king of glory? the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. 
Ye princes, take up your gates, and ye everlasting gates, be ye raised; and the king of glory shall enter. 
Who is this king of glory? the Lord of virtuesor the Lord of hosts, he is the king of glory.
