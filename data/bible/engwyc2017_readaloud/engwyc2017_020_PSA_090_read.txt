Chapter 90.
The prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, thou art made help to us; from generation into generation. 
Before that hills were made, either the earth and the world was formed; from the world and into the world, thou art God. 
Turn thou not away a man into lowness; and thou saidest, Ye sons of men, be turned again. 
For a thousand years be before thine eyes; as yesterday, which is passed, and as the keeping in the night. 
The years of them shall be; that be had for nought. Early pass he, as an herb, 
early flourish he, and pass; in the eventide fall he down, be he hard, and wax he dry. 
For we have failed in thine ire; and we be troubled in thy strong vengeance. 
Thou hast set or put our wicked-nesses in thy sight; our world in the lightening of thy cheer. 
For all our days have failed; and we have failed in thine ire. Our years we shall bethink upon as a spider; 
the days of our years be those seventy years. Forsooth, if fourscore or eighty years be in mighty men; and the more time of them is travail and sorrow. For mildness came above; and we shall be chastised. 
Who knew the power of thine ire; and durst number thine ire for thy dread? 
Make thy right hand so known; and make men learned in heart by wisdom. 
Lord, be thou converted some-deal; and be thou able to be prayed of by thy servants. 
We were ful filled early with thy mercy; we made full out joy, and we delighted in all our days. 
We were glad for the days in which thou madest us meek; for the years in which we saw evils. 
Lord, behold thou into thy servants, and into thy works; and dress thou the sons of them. 
And the shining of our Lord God be on us; and dress thou the works of our hands on us; and dress thou the works of our hands.
