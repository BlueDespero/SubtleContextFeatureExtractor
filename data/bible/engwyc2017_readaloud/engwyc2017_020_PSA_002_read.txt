Chapter 2.
Why gnashed with teeth heathen men; and peoples thought vain things? 
The kings of earth stood together; and princes came together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 
Break we the bonds of them; and cast we away the yoke of them from us. 
He that dwelleth in heavens shall scorn them; and the Lord shall bemock them. 
Then he shall speak to them in his wrath; and he shall trouble them in his strong vengeance. 
Soothly I am ordained of him a king upon Zion, his holy hill; 
preaching his commandment. The Lord said to me, Thou art my son; I have begotten thee today. 
Ask thou of me, and I shall give to thee heathen men for thine heritage; and for thy possession the terms of earth. 
Thou shalt govern them in an iron rod; and thou shalt break them altogether as the vessel of a potter. 
And now, ye kings, understand; ye that deem the earth, be ye learned. 
Serve ye the Lord with dread; and make ye full out joy to him with trembling. 
Take ye lore of chastising; lest the Lord be wroth sometime, and ye perish from the just way. When his wrath shall burn out in short time; blessed be all they, that trust in him.
