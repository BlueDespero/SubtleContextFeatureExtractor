JONAH.
Chapter 3.
And the word of the Lord was made the second time to Jonah, and said, 
Rise thou, and go into Nineveh, the great city, and preach thou in it the preaching which I speak to thee. 
And Jonah rose, and went into Nineveh, by the word of the Lord. And Nineveh was a great city, of the journey of three days. 
And Jonah began for to enter into the city, by the journey of one day, and cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overturned, or destroyed. 
And men of Nineveh believed to the Lord, and preached fasting, and were clothed with sackcloths, from the more till to the less. 
And the word came to the king of Nineveh; and he rose off his seat, and casted away his clothing from him, and was clothed with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
And he cried, and said in Nineveh of the mouth of the king and of his princes, saying, Men, and work beasts, and oxen, and sheep, taste not anything, neither be fed, neither drink water. 
And men be covered with sack-cloths, and work beasts, all cry to the Lord in strength; and be a man converted, or all-turned, from his evil way, and from wickedness that is in the hands of them. 
Who knoweth, if God be converted, and forgive, and be turned away from strong vengeance of his wrath, and we shall not perish? 
And God saw the works of them, that they were converted from their evil way; and God had mercy on the malice which he spake, that he would do to them, and did not.
