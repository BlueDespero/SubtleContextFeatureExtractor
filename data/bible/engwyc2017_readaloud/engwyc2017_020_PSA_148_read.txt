Chapter 148.
Alleluia. Ye of heavens, praise the Lord; praise ye him in high things. 
All his angels, praise ye him; all his virtues, praise ye him. 
Sun and moon, praise ye him; all stars and light, praise ye him. 
Heavens of heavens, praise ye him; and the waters that be above heavens, 
praise they the name of the Lord. For he said, and things were made; he commanded, and things were made of nought. 
He ordained those things into the world, and into the world of world; he setted a commandment, and it shall not pass. 
Ye of the earth, praise the Lord; dragons, and all depths of waters. 
Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirits of tempests; that do his word. 
Mountains, and all little hills; trees bearing fruit, and all cedars. 
Wild beasts, and all tame beasts; serpents, and feathered birds. 
The kings of earth, and all peoples; the princes, and all judges of earth. 
Young men, and virgins, eld or old men with the younger, 
praise the name of the Lord; for the name of him alone is enhanced. His acknowledging be on heaven and earth; 
and he hath enhanced the horn of his people. An hymn be to all his saints; to the children of Israel, to a people nighing to him.
