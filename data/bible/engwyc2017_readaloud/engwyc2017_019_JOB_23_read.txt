JOB.
Chapter 23.
And Job answered, and said, 
Now also my word is in bitter-ness, and the hand of my wound is aggrieved on my wailing. 
Who giveth to me, that I know, and find him, and come unto his throne? 
I shall set doom before him, and I shall fill my mouth with arguments; 
that I know the words, which he shall answer to me, and that I under-stand, what he shall speak to me. 
I will or desire not, that he strive with me by great strength, neither that he oppress me with the heaviness of his greatness. 
Set he forth equity against me, and my doom come perfectly to victory. 
If I go to the east, God appeareth not there; if I go to the west, I shall not understand him; 
if I go to the left side, what shall I do? I shall not take him; if I turn me to the right side, I shall not see him. 
But he knoweth my way, and he shall prove me as gold, that passeth through the fire. 
My foot pursued or followed his steps; I kept to his way, and I bowed not away from it. 
I went not away from the commandments of his lips; and I hid in my bosom the words of his mouth. 
For he is alone, and no man may turn away his thoughts; and whatever thing he would, his will did this thing. 
When he hath ful filled his will in me, also many other like things be ready to him. 
And therefore I am troubled of his face, and I beholding him am anguished for dread. 
God hath made nesh mine heart, and Almighty God hath troubled me. 
Certainly I perished not for dark-nesses nighing to me; neither mist covered my face.
