JOB.
Chapter 4.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answer-ed, and said, 
If we begin to speak to thee, in hap thou shalt take it heavily; but who may hold a word conceived? 
Lo! thou hast taught full many men, and thou hast strengthened hands made faint. 
Thy words have confirmed men doubting, and thou hast comforted knees trembling. 
But now a wound is come upon thee, and thou hast failed, or fainted; it hath touched thee, and thou art troubled. 
Where is thy dread, thy strength, and thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways? 
I beseech thee, have thou mind, what innocent man perished ever, either when rightful or rightwise men were done away? 
Certainly rather I saw them, that work wickedness, and sow sorrows, and reap those or them, 
to have perished by God blowing, and to be wasted by the spirit of his ire. 
The roaring of a lion, and the voice of a lioness, and the teeth of whelps of lions, be all-broken. 
Tigers perished, for she had not prey; and the whelps of the lion be destroyed. 
Certainly an hid word was said to me, and mine ear took as it were thief-like the veins of the privy speak-ing thereof. 
In the hideousness of the night’s sight, when heavy sleep is wont to occupy men, 
dread and trembling held me; and all my bones were afeared. 
And when the spirit went in my presence, the hairs of my flesh had hideousness. 
One stood, whose cheer, or likeness, I knew not, an image before mine eyes; and I heard a voice as of a soft wind. 
Whether a man shall be made just or justified in comparison of God? either a man shall be cleaner than his Maker? 
Lo! they that serve him be not steadfast; and he hath found shrewd-ness in his angels. 
How much more they that dwell in houses of clay, which have an earthly foundament, shall be wasted as of a moth. 
From morrowtide till to eventide they shall be cut down; and for no man understandeth, they shall perish without end. 
And they, that be left, shall be taken away; they shall die, and not in wisdom.
