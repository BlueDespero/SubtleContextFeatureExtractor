Chapter 25.
The song of David. Lord, to thee I have raised my soul; 
my God, I trust in thee, be I not ashamed. Neither mine enemies scorn me; 
for all men that suffer thee shall not be shamed. All men doing wicked things superfluously; be they shamed. 
Lord, show thou thy ways to me; and teach thou me thy paths. 
Dress thou me in thy truth, and teach thou me, for thou art God, my saviour; and I suffered thee all day. 
Lord, have thou mind of thy merciful doings; and of thy mercies that be from the world. 
Have thou not mind on the tres-passes of my youth; and on mine unknowings. Thou, Lord, have mind on me by thy mercy; for thy goodness. 
The Lord is sweet and rightful; for this cause he shall give a law to men trespassing in the way. 
He shall dress meek men in doom; he shall teach mild men his ways. 
All the ways of the Lord be mercy and truth; to men seeking his testament, and his witnessings. 
Lord, for thy name, thou shalt do mercy to my sin; for it is much. 
Who is a man, that dreadeth the Lord? he ordaineth to him a law in the way which he should choose. 
His soul shall dwell in goods; and his seed shall inherit the land. 
The Lord is a firmness to men dreading him; and his testament is, that it be showed to them. 
Mine eyes be evermore toward the Lord; for he shall pull away or pull up my feet from the snare. 
Behold thou to me, and have thou mercy on me; for I am one alone and poor. 
The tribulations of mine heart be multiplied; deliver thou me of my needs. 
See thou my meekness and my travail; and forgive thou all my tres-passes. 
Behold thou mine enemies, for they be multiplied; and they hate me by wicked hatred. 
Keep thou my soul, and deliver me; be I not ashamed, for I hoped in thee. 
Innocent men and rightful cleaved to me; for I suffered thee. 
God, deliver thou Israel; from all his tribulations.
