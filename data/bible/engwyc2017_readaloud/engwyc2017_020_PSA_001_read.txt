Chapter 1.
Blessed is the man, that goeth not in the counsel of wicked men; and stood not in the way of sinners, and sat not in the chair of pestilence. 
But his will is in the law of the Lord; and he shall bethink in the law of him day and night. 
And he shall be as a tree, which is planted beside the runnings of waters; that shall give his fruit in his time. And his leaf shall not fall down; and all things, whichever he shall do, shall have prosperity. 
Not so wicked men, not so; but they be as dust, which the wind casteth away from the face of the earth. 
Therefore wicked men rise not again in doom; neither sinners in the council of just men nor the sinful in the council of the rightwise. 
For the Lord knoweth the way of just men or the rightwise; and the way of wicked men shall perish.
