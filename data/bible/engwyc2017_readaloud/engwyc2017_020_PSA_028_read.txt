Chapter 28.
To David. The psalm to this David. Lord, I shall cry to thee; my God, be thou not still from me, be thou not still any time from me; and I shall be made like to them, that go down into the pit. 
Lord, hear thou the voice of my beseeching, while I pray to thee; while I raise mine hands toward thine holy temple. 
Betake thou not me together with sinners; and lose thou not me with them that work wickedness. Which speak peace to their neighbours; but evils be in their hearts. 
Give thou to them after the works of them; and after the wickedness of their findings. Give thou to them after the works of their hands; yield thou their yielding to them. 
For they understood not the works of the Lord, and by the works of his hands thou shalt destroy them; and thou shalt not build them. 
Blessed be the Lord; for he heard the voice of my beseeching. 
The Lord is mine helper and my defender; and mine heart hoped in him, and I am helped. And my flesh flowered again; and of my will I shall acknowledge to him. 
The Lord is the strength of his people; and he is the defender of the savings of his christ. 
Lord, make thou safe thy people, and bless thou thine heritage; and rule thou them, and enhance thou them till into without end.
