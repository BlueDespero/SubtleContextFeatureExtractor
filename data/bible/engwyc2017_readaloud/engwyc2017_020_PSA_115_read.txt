Chapter 115.
Alleluia. Lord, not to us, Lord, not to us; but give thou glory to thy name. Of thy mercy, and of thy truth; 
lest any time heathen men say, Where is the God of them? 
Forsooth our God in heaven; did all things, whichever he would. 
The simulacra of heathen men be silver and gold; the works of men’s hands. 
They have mouths, and shall not speak; they have eyes, and shall not see. 
They have ears, and shall not hear; they have nostrils, and shall not smell. 
They have hands, and shall not grope; they have feet, and shall not go; they shall not cry in their throat. 
They that make those simulacra be made like those or them; and all that trust in them. 
The house of Israel hoped in the Lord; he is the helper of them, and the defender of them. 
The house of Aaron hoped in the Lord; he is the helper of them, and the defender of them. 
They that dread the Lord, hoped in the Lord; he is the helper of them, and the defender of them. 
The Lord was mindful of us; and blessed us. He blessed the house of Israel; he blessed the house of Aaron. 
He blessed all men that dread the Lord; both little and greater. 
The Lord add, either increase, on you; on you, and on your sons. 
Blessed be ye of the Lord; that made heaven and earth. 
Heaven of heaven is to the Lord/ Heaven of heavens to the Lord; but he gave the earth to the sons of men. 
Lord, not dead men shall praise thee; neither all men that go down into hell. 
But we that live, bless the Lord; from this time now, and till into the world.
