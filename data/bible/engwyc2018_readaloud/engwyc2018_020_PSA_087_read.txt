PSALMS.
Chapter 87.
The psalm of the song of the sons of Korah. The foundaments thereof be in holy hills; (A psalm, yea, a song by the Korahites. Its foundations be upon the holy hill/s;) 
(and) the Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the tabernacles of Jacob. 
Thou city of God, without end; glorious things be said of thee. (Thou city of God; may glorious things be said of thee forever.) 
I shall be mindful of Rahab, and Babylon; knowing me. Lo! aliens, and Tyre, and the people of Ethiopians; they were there. (I shall remember (the people of) Rahab, and of Babylon; they all know me. Behold! Philistia, and Tyre, and the Ethiopian people; they all were there.) 
Whether a man shall say to Zion, And a man is born therein; and that man, (the) alder Highest, founded it? (And of Zion it shall be said, This person, and that person, were born there; and the Most High himself founded it.) 
The Lord shall tell in the scriptures of (these) peoples; and of these princes, that were therein. (The Lord shall write of these peoples; and of their princes, or their leaders, who all were there.) 
As the dwelling of all that be glad; is in thee. (And they all shall dance; and they shall sing, In Zion is the Source of all our blessings.)
