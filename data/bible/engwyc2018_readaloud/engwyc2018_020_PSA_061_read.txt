Chapter 61.
To victory, on organs, to David himself. God, hear thou my beseeching; give thou attention to my prayer. (For the choirmaster, with stringed instruments, a song by David. God, hear thou my plea; give thou attention to my prayer.) 
From the ends of the land I cried to thee; the while mine heart was anguished, thou enhancedest me in a stone, (or and while my heart was anguished, thou liftedest me up on a rock). Thou leddest me forth, 
for thou art made mine hope; a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. (for thou art made my hope; a tower of strength before my enemies.) 
I shall dwell in thy tabernacle into worlds; I shall be covered in the covering of thy wings. (I shall live in thy Tent forever or I shall live in thy dwelling place forever; I shall be covered with the covering of thy wings.) 
For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer; thou hast given heritage to them that dread thy name (or thou hast given me the inheritance of those who fear thy name or of those who revere thy name). 
Thou shalt add, either increase, days onto the days of the king; his years till into the day of generation and of generation. (Thou shalt add days onto the days of the king; yea, year upon year for many generations.) 
He dwelleth into without end in the sight of God; who shall seek the mercy and truth of him? (He shall live before God forever; may thy love, and thy faithfulness, preserve, and protect him.) 
So I shall say psalm to thy name into the world of world; that I yield my vows from day into day. (And I shall sing songs, or praises, to thy name forever and ever; as I offer my vows each day.)
