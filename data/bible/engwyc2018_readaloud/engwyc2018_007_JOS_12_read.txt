JOSHUA.
Chapter 12.
These be the (two) kings which the sons of Israel have smitten, and wielded their lands, beyond (the) Jordan, at the east, from the strand of Arnon unto the hill of Hermon, and all the east coast that beholdeth the wilderness. (These be the two kings whom the Israelites struck down, and took over their lands, east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River unto Mount Hermon, and all the land to the east that looketh toward the wilderness.) 
Sihon, the king of Amorites, that dwelled in Heshbon, was lord from Aroer, which is set on the brink of the strand of Arnon, and of the middle part in the valley, and of half Gilead, till to the strand of Jabbok, which is the term of the sons of Ammon; (There was Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and who ruled half of Gilead, from Aroer, which is set on the banks of the Arnon River, and from the middle part of the valley, unto the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites;) 
and from the wilderness unto the sea of Chinneroth, against the east, and unto the sea of (the) desert, which is the saltiest sea, at the east coast, in the way that leadeth to Bethjeshimoth, and from the south part that lieth under Ashdoth, unto Pisgah. (and from the wilderness unto the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, or Lake Galilee, and unto the eastern side of the Salt Sea, that is, the Dead Sea, on the way that leadeth to Bethjeshimoth, and from the south that lieth under Mount Pisgah or and from the south that lieth under Ashdothpisgah.) 
The term of Og, king of Bashan, of the relics of Rephaim, that is, giants, that dwelled in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, (And there was Og, the king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, that is, of the giants, who lived in Ashtaroth and in Edrei,) 
and he was lord in the hill of Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, till to the terms of Geshurites and Maachathites, and of the half part of Gilead, and to the term of Sihon, king of Heshbon. (and he ruled Mount Hermon, and Salcah, and all of Bashan, unto the borders of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and also ruled half of Gilead, unto the border of Sihon, the king of Heshbon.) 
Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the sons of Israel, smited them (all); and Moses gave the land of them into (a) possession to Reubenites, and to Gadites, and to half the lineage of Manasseh, (or and Moses gave their lands for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and to the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh). 
These be the kings of the land, which Joshua and the sons of Israel smited beyond (the) Jordan, at the west coast, from Baalgad in the field of Lebanon, till to the hill whose part ascendeth into Seir; and Joshua gave it into (a) possession to the lineages of Israel, to each his own part, (And these be the kings of the lands, whom Joshua and the Israelites struck down west of the Jordan River, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon, unto Mount Halak, which leadeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it all for a possession to the tribes of Israel, to each their own portion,) 
as well in hilly places, as in plain and field places; in Ashtoreth, and in the wilderness, and in the south, was (the) Hittites, and Amorites, Canaanites, and Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. (in the hill country, and on the plains, or on the Arabah, and in the valley, and by the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south, or in the Negeb; these lands had been inhabited by the Hittites, and Amorites, Canaanites, and Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.) 
The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is at the side of Bethel, one, (or which is beside Bethel, one);
