JOB.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad (the) Shuhite answered, and said, 
Power and dread is with him, that is, God, which maketh according in his high things. (Power and reverence is with God or Power and fear is with God, who maketh peace in all his high places.) 
Whether there is (a) number of his knights? (or Can his host be counted?) and upon whom shineth not his light? 
Whether a man comparisoned to God may be justified, either a man born of a woman may appear clean? (Can a man be justified when compared to God, or can a man born of a woman ever be pure, or innocent?) 
Lo! also the moon shineth not, and the stars be not clean in his sight; (Behold! to his eyes, the moon shineth not, and the stars be not pure;) 
how much more man, that is rot, and the son of a man, that is a worm, is unclean, (and vile), in comparison to God. (and so how much more a man, who is but rot, and the son of a man, who is but a worm, be unclean, and vile, when compared to God.)
