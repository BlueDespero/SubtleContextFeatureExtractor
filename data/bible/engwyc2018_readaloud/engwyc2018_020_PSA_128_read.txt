Chapter 128.
The song of degrees. Blessed be all men, that dread the Lord; that go in his ways. (A song for steps of ascending. Happy be all those, who fear the Lord or who revere the Lord; and who go in his ways.) 
For thou shalt eat the travails of thine hands; thou art blessed, and it shall be well to thee. (For thou shalt eat the fruit of thy labour; thou shalt be happy, and it shall be well with thee.) 
Thy wife shall be as a plenteous vine; in the sides of thine house. Thy sons as the new springs of olive trees; in the compass of thy board. (Thy wife shall be like a fruitful vine; by the side of thy house. And thy sons and thy daughters shall be like the new branches of olive trees; all around thy table.) 
Lo! so a man shall be blessed; that dreadeth the Lord. (Behold! so shall the man be blessed; who feareth the Lord or who hath reverence for the Lord.) 
The Lord bless thee from Zion; and see thou the goods of Jerusalem in all the days of thy life. (May the Lord bless thee from Zion; and may thou see the prosperity of Jerusalem or and may thou share in the prosperity of Jerusalem, all the days of thy life.) 
And see thou the sons of thy sons; see thou peace on Israel. (And may thou see the children of thy children. May peace be upon Israel.)
