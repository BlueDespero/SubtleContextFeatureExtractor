JUDITH.
Chapter 1.
And so Arphaxad, king of Medes, had made subject many folks to his empire; and he builded a full mighty city, which he called Ecbatana. 
Of square stones and carved or hewn he made the walls thereof, in the height of threescore cubits and ten or seventy cubits, and in the breadth of thirty cubits. And he set the towers thereof in the height of an hundred cubits. 
And by the squareness of the towers ever either side was stretched forth, by or in the space of twenty feet; and he set the gates of that city in (or to) the height of those towers. 
And he had glory, as a mighty man in the power of his host, and in the glory of his chariots or his four-horsed carts. 
Therefore Nebuchadnezzar, king of Assyrians, that reigned in the great city Nineveh, in the twelfth year of his realm he fought against Arphaxad, and he got, or took, Arphaxad in a great field, 
that was called Ragau, beside the flood (s), (or the rivers), of Euphrates, and Tigris, and Hydaspes, in the field of Arioch, the king of Elamites. 
Then the realm of Nebuchadnezzar was enhanced (or exalted), and his heart was raised (up)into pride; and he sent to all men, that dwelled in Cilicia, and in Damascus, and in Lebanon, 
and to (the) folks, that were in Carmel, and in Gilead, and to men dwelling in Galilee, and in the great field of Esdraelon, 
and to all men or to all, that were in Samaria, and beyond the flood (or the river) of Jordan, unto Jerusalem; and to all the land of Goshen, till that men come to the hills of Ethiopia. 
To all these men, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Assyrians, sent messengers; 
and all these (men) against-said with one will, and they sent (back) again his messengers void, and they casted them away without honour. 
Then Nebuchadnezzar was wroth to all that land, and he swore by his realm and by his throne, that he would defend him(self) from all these countries or regions, that is, (that he would) assail all those countries.
