1ST JOHN.
Chapter 1.
That thing that was from the beginning, which we heard, which we saw with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands touched, of the word of life; (That which was from the beginning, which we heard, which we saw with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands touched, of the Word of Life, or of the Living Word;) 
and the life is showed. And we saw, and witness, and tell to you the everlasting life, that was with the Father, and appeared to us. (and that Life was shown. And we saw, and testify, and tell you about the Eternal Life, who was with the Father, and appeared to us.) 
Therefore that thing, that we saw, and heard, we tell to you, (or And so that which we saw, and heard, we tell to you), (so) that also ye have fellowship with us, and our fellowship be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
And we write this thing to you, that ye have joy, and that your joy be full. (And we write this to you, so that ye have joy, and that your joy be complete.) 
And this is the telling, that we heard of him, and tell to you, that God is light, and there be no darknesses in him. (And this is the tiding, or the message, that we heard from him, and tell to you, that God is light, and there is no darkness in him.) 
If we say, that we have fellowship with him, and we wander in darknesses (or and we walk in the darkness), we lie, and do not (have the) truth. 
But if we walk in (the) light, as also he is in (the) light, we have fellowship together; and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin. 
If we say, that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and (the) truth is not in us. 
If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just, that he forgive to us our sins, and cleanse us from all wickedness. 
And if we say, that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
