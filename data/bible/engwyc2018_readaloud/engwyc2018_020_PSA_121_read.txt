Chapter 121.
The song of degrees. I raised mine eyes to the hills; from whence help shall come to me. (A song for steps of ascending. I raised up my eyes to the hills, or the mountains; O where shall I find help? or from where help shall come to me.) 
Mine help is of the Lord; that made heaven and earth. (My help is from the Lord; who made heaven and earth.) 
The Lord give not thy foot into moving; neither he nap, that keepeth thee. (The Lord shall not let thy foot slip, or stumble; nor shall he nap, who keepeth thee safe.) 
Lo! he shall not nap, neither sleep; that keepeth Israel. (Behold! he, who keepeth Israel safe; shall not nap, or sleep.) 
The Lord keepeth thee; the Lord is thy protection above thy right hand. (The Lord keepeth thee safe; the Lord is thy protection at thy right hand.) 
The sun shall not burn thee by day; neither the moon by night. 
The Lord keep thee from all evil; the Lord keep thy soul. (The Lord shall keep thee safe from all evil; yea, the Lord shall keep thee safe.) 
The Lord keep thy going in and thy going out; from this time now and into the world. (The Lord shall guard thy coming in, and thy going out; from this time now, and forever.)
