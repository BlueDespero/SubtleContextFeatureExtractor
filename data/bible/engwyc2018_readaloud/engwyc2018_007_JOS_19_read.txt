And the second lot of the sons of Simeon went out, by their families; and the heritage of them, in the midst of the possession of the sons of Judah, (And the second lot went out to the sons of Simeon, by their families; and their inheritance, in the midst of the possession of the sons of Judah,) 
was Beersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah, 
and Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem, 
and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, 
and Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah, 
and Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities, and the towns of those; 
Ain, and Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities, and the towns of those; 
all the towns by compass of these cities, unto Baalath(beer) Ramath, against the south coast, were seventeen cities. This is the heritage of the sons of Simeon, by their families, (and so all the cities with the towns around them, unto Baalathbeer, or Ramah, in the south, were seventeen altogether. This is the inheritance of the sons of Simeon, by their families,) 
in the possession and part of the sons of Judah, for it was more (than Judah had need of); and therefore the sons of Simeon had (a) possession in the midst of the heritage thereof (or and so the sons of Simeon hadtheir possession in the midst of Judah’s inheritance). 
And the third lot of the sons of Zebulun felled, by their families; and the term of (the) possession of the sons of Zebulun was made unto Sarid; (And the third lot fell to the sons of Zebulun, by their families; and the border of the possession of the sons of Zebulun was made unto Shadud;) 
and it goeth up from the sea, and from Maralah; and it cometh into Dabbasheth, unto the strand that is against Jokneam; (and it goeth up to the west to Maralah; and it cometh to Dabbasheth, and to the river east of Jokneam;) 
and it turneth again from Sarid, against the east, into the coasts of Chislothtabor, (or and it turneth again from Shadud, toward the east, to the border of Chislothtabor); and it goeth out to Daberath; and it goeth up against Japhia; 
and from thence it passeth forth to the east coast to Gittahhepher, and to Ittahkazin; and it goeth out into Remmonmethoar, and Neah; 
and it compasseth to the north, and to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof be the valley of Jiphthahel, (or and its end, or its limit, is the Jiphthahel Valley), 
and Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem; twelve cities, and the towns of those. 
This is the heritage of the lineage of the sons of Zebulun, by their families, and the cities and towns of those. (This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, by their families, and their cities and towns.) 
The fourth lot went out to Issachar, by his families; (The fourth lot went out to the sons of Issachar, by their families;) 
and the heritage thereof was Jezreel (or and its inheritance was Jezreel), and Chesulloth, and Shunem, 
and Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 
and Rabbith, and Kishion, (and) Abez, 
and Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez. 
And the term thereof cometh unto Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings thereof were (the) Jordan; sixteen cities, and the towns of those. (And its border cometh unto Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and its end, or its limit, was the Jordan River; sixteen cities, and their towns.) 
This is the possession of the sons of Issachar, by their families, the cities and the towns of those. 
And the fifth lot felled to the lineage of the sons of Asher, by their families; 
and the term of them was Helkath (or and its border was made unto Helkath), and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 
and Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and it cometh till to Carmel of the sea, and Shihor, and Libnath, (or and it goeth unto Carmel on the west, and Shihorlibnath); 
and it turneth again, against the east, to Bethdagon; and it passeth unto Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel, against the north, into Bethemek, and Neiel; and it goeth out to the left side to Cabul (or and it goeth out on the north side to Cabul), 
and Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, unto Great(er) Sidon; 
and it turneth again into Ramah, unto the strongest city Tyre, and unto Hosah; and the outgoings thereof shall be into the sea, from the part of Achzib, (and it turneth again at Ramah, and goeth to the strengthened city of Tyre, and to Hosah; and its ends, or its limits, on the west were Mahalab, and Achzib,) 
and Ummah, and Aphek, and Rehob; two and twenty cities, and the towns of those. 
This is the possession of the sons of Asher, by their families, the cities, and (the) towns of those. 
The sixth lot of the sons of Naphtali felled, by their families; (The sixth lot fell to the sons of Naphtali, by their families;) 
and the term began from Heleph, and Allon, and Zaanannim, and Adami, which is Nekeb, and Jabneel, till to Lakum; and the outgoing(s) of them till to (the) Jordan; (and the border began from Heleph, and Allon, and Zaanannim, and Adami, which is Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and its end, or its limit, was the Jordan River;) 
and the term turneth again, against the west, into Aznoth of Tabor; and from thence it goeth out into Hukkok, and it passeth into Zebulun, against the south, and into Asher, against the west, and into Judah, at (the) Jordan, against the rising of the sun; (and the border turneth again, on the west, into Aznothtabor; and from there it goeth out to Hukkok, and it passeth into Zebulun, on the south, and into Asher, on the west, and into Judah, at the Jordan River, on the east;) 
of the strongest city Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, and Rakkath, Chinnereth, (and their strengthened cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, and Rakkath, and Chinnereth,) 
and Adamah, and Ramah, Hazor, 
and Kedesh, and Edrei, Enhazor, 
and Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities, and the towns of those. 
This is the possession of the lineage of the sons of Naphtali, by their families, the cities, and the towns of those. 
The seventh lot went out to the lineage of the sons of Dan, by their families; 
and the term of the possession thereof was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh, that is, the city of the sun, (and the border of its possession was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh, that is, the City of the Sun,) 
Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 
Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 
Eltekeh, Gibbethon, and Baalath, 
Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, 
and Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the term that beholdeth Joppa, and is closed with that end. (and Mejarkon, and Rakkon, and the border was opposite Joppa; but the sons of Dan lost this land.) 
And (so) the sons of Dan went up, and fought against Leshem; and they took it, and they smote it by the sharpness of (the) sword, and they had it in possession, and dwelled therein; and they called the name thereof Leshem, Dan, by the name of Dan, their father, (or and they renamed Leshem, Dan, after Dan, the name of their forefather). 
This is the possession of the lineage of Dan, by their families, the cities, and the towns of those. 
And when they had fulfilled to part the land by lot to all men by their lineages, the sons of Israel gave (a) possession to Joshua, the son of Nun, in the midst of them, 
by the commandment of the Lord, the city which he asked (for), Timnathserah, in the hill (country) of Ephraim; and he builded the city, and dwelled therein (or and lived there). 
These be the possessions which Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the princes of the families, and of the lineages of the sons of Israel (or and the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites), parted by lot in Shiloh, before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of (the) witnessing; and (so) they parted the land.
