1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all people, 
on behalf of kings and all those who are in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 
For this is good and acceptable before God our Savior, 
who desires all people to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth. 
For there is one God, and there is one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, 
who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony in due time; 
for which I was appointed a herald and apostle—I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie—a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth. 
I desire therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 
Likewise also that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and discretion, not with braids or gold or pearls or expensive clothing, 
but which is fitting for women professing godliness, by means of good works. 
Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. 
And I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. 
For Adam first was formed, then Eve. 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, has come to be in transgression. 
Nevertheless she shall be saved through childbirth, if they remain in faith and love, and sanctification, with self-control.
