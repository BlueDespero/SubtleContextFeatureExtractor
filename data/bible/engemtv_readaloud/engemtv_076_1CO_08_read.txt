Corinthians.
Chapter 8.
Now concerning the things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. 
And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has come to know nothing yet as he ought to know. 
But if anyone loves God, this one has been known by Him. 
Therefore concerning the eating of the things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. 
For even if they are being called “gods” whether in heaven or on earth (just as there are many gods and many lords), 
yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live. 
However, this knowledge is not in all people; rather some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as something offered to idols; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat do we have more, nor if we do not eat do we lack. 
But take heed lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak. 
For if anyone should see you who has knowledge dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be strengthened so that they eat foods offered to idols? 
And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for the sake of whom Christ died? 
But when you thus sin against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will by no means eat meat, lest I cause my brother to stumble.
