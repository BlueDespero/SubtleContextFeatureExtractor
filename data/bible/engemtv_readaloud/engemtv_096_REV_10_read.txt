Revelation.
Chapter 10.
And I saw a mighty angel coming down from heaven, having been clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire, 
and having in his hand a scroll having been opened. And he put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, 
and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices. 
Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken, and do not write them.” 
And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven 
and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should be no more delay; 
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets. 
Then the voice which I heard from heaven was speaking with me again and saying, “Go, take the little scroll which was open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.” 
And I went to the angel, saying to him to give to me the little scroll. And he said to me, “Take it and eat it; and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth.” 
Then I took the scroll out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. And when I ate it, my stomach was made bitter. 
And he said to me, “You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”
