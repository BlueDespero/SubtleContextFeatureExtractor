Titus.
Chapter 3.
Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, 
to slander no one, to be peaceable, gentle, demonstrating all meekness to all men. 
For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, being deceived, being enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 
But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 
not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 
whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
that having been justified by His grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
Faithful is this word, and concerning these things I want you to strongly affirm, so that those who have believed in God may take thought to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men. 
But avoid foolish disputes and genealogies, and strifes and legal fights; for they are unprofitable and futile. 
Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition, 
knowing that such a person has been perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned. 
Whenever I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
Speedily send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, in order that they may lack nothing. 
And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, lest they be unfruitful. 
All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
