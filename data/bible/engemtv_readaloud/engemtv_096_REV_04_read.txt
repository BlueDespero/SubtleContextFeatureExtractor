Revelation.
Chapter 4.
After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must take place after this.” 
Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in heaven (and One sitting on the throne) 
similar in appearance to a jasper and sardius stone, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. 
Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw the twenty-four elders sitting, having been clothed in white robes; and on their heads were crowns of gold. 
And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven torches of fire were burning before His throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 
And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living beings full of eyes in front and in back. 
The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like a calf, the third living being had a face of a man, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. 
And the four living beings, each one having six wings apiece, were full of eyes around and within. And they never rest day or night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, He who was, and who is, and who is to come!” 
Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him that sits on the throne, to Him that lives forever and ever, 
the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and they worship Him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 
“You are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy One, To receive glory and honor and power; Because You created all things, And by Your will they existed and were created.”
