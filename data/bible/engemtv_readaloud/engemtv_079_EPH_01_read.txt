The Epistle Of Paul To The Ephesians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, 
even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love, 
having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 
to the praise of His glorious grace, by which He bestowed favor upon us in the Beloved. 
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace 
which He lavished on us in all wisdom and insight, 
having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, 
for an administration of the fullness of the times, He might bring together all things in Christ, those in heaven and those on the earth—in Him. 
In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose, who works all things according to the counsel of His will, 
so that we should be to the praise of His glory, we who first trusted in Christ. 
In whom you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 
who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory. 
Because of this I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 
do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: 
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 
having the eyes of your heart enlightened; that you may know what is the hope to which He has called you, what are the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, 
and what is the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 
which He worked in Christ, having raised Him from the dead, and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, 
above every ruler and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the coming age. 
And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, 
which is His body, the fullness of Him filling all things in all.
