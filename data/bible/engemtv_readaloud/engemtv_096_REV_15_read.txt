Revelation.
Chapter 15.
Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, because in them the wrath of God is finished. 
And I saw something like a glassy sea having been mixed with fire, and those who prevailed over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having the harps of God. 
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: “Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations! 
Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, Because Your righteous judgments have been manifested.” 
After these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. 
And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, who were dressed in pure bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden belts. 
Then one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever. 
And the temple was filled by the smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
