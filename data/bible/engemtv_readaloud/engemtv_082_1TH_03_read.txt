1 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Therefore, when we could bear it no longer, we were well pleased to be left behind at Athens alone, 
and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, in order to establish you and exhort you concerning your faith, 
that no one should be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this. 
For even when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we were going to be afflicted, just as it has come to pass, and as you know. 
Because of this, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you, and our labor be in vain. 
But now when Timothy came to us from you, and brought good news to us of your faith and your love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, as we also long to see you— 
because of this we were encouraged, brothers, in regard to you in all our affliction and distress by your faith. 
For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord. 
For whatever thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we are rejoicing because of you in the presence of our God, 
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and to perfect what is lacking in your faith? 
Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, lead us directly to you. 
And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all men, as indeed we also do toward you, 
so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
