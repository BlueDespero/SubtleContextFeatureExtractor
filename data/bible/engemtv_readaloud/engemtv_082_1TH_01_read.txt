The First Epistle Of Paul To The Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We give thanks to God always concerning you all, making mention of you in our prayers, 
constantly remembering your work of faith, labor of love, and perseverance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father, 
knowing, beloved brothers, your election by God. 
For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, just as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake. 
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, in that you received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit, 
so that you became patterns to all those who believe in Macedonia and Achaia. 
For from you the word of the Lord has resounded, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we need not say anything. 
For they themselves report about us what kind of entrance we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 
and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.
