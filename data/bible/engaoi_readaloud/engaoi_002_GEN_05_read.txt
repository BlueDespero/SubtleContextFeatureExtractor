Genesis.
Chapter 5.
When God created people, he made them like himself. He created them male and female. Then he blessed them and said, “You will be called ‘people’.” These are the names of Adam's descendants. 
When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son who was like himself and he called him Seth. 
After that Adam lived another 800 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 930 years old he died. 
When Seth was 105 years old he had a son called Enosh. 
After that he lived another 807 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 912 years old he died. 
When Enosh was 90 years old he had a son called Kenan. 
After that he lived another 815 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 905 years old he died. 
When Kenan was 70 years old he had a son called Mahalalel. 
After that he lived another 840 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 910 years old he died. 
When Mahalalel was 65 years old he had a son called Jared. 
After that he lived another 830 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 895 years old he died. 
When Jared was 162 years old he had a son called Enoch. 
After that he lived another 800 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 962 years old he died. 
When Enoch was 65 years old he had a son called Methuselah. 
Enoch had fellowship with God. And he had other children, and when he was 365 years old Enoch disappeared, because God took him away. 
When Enoch's son Methuselah was 187 years old he had a son called Lamech. 
After that he lived another 782 years and he had other children.

When Lamech was 182 years old he had a son. 
He said, “Yahweh cursed the ground and it was spoilt. But when this child grows up he will comfort us and make our hard work easier.” So he named him Noah because Noah means “he will comfort.” 
After that, Lamech lived another 595 years and he had other children. 
Then when he was 777 years old he died. 
When Noah was 500 years old he had his family. His first son was Shem, the next was Japheth and the youngest was Ham.
