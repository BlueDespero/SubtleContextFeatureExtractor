Chapter 93.
The Lord reigns, clothed in majesty! He wears his royal robes, with his power worn like a belt. The world is held together firmly—it cannot be broken apart. 
Your throne has existed from ages past; you are from eternity. 
The floods have raised up, Lord; the floods have raised their voices; the floods have raised up their crashing waves. 
But greater than the most violent ocean, greater than the largest waves of the sea, the greatest is the Lord above. 
Your laws are totally trustworthy. Your house, Lord, is holy forever.
