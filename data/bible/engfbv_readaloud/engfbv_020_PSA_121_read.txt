Chapter 121.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. I look to the hills—but is that where my help comes from? 
My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. 
He will not let you fall; he who watches over you won't fall asleep. 
In fact he who watches over you doesn't take naps or fall asleep. 
The Lord keeps watch over you; the Lord protects you; he stands right beside you. 
The sun won't hurt you during the day, nor the moon at night. 
The Lord will protect you from all kinds of evil; he will keep you safe and sound. 
The Lord will look after you when you leave, and when you return, now and forever.
