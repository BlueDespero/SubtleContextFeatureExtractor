Chapter 23.
A psalm of David. Since the Lord is my shepherd, I have everything I need. 
He gives me rest in green fields. He leads me towards quietly flowing streams. 
He revives me. He guides me along the right paths because that's the kind of person he is. 
Even when I walk through the valley dark as death, I'm not afraid of any evil, because you are right there with me; your rod and your staff protect me. 
You prepare a banquet for me before my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with olive oil. My cup is so full it overflows! 
I'm absolutely certain that your goodness and trustworthy love will be with me all through my life, and I will live in the house of the Lord forever.
