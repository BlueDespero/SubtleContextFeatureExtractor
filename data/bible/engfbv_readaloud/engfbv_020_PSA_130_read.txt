Chapter 130.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. Lord, I cry out to you from the depths of my pain. 
Please listen to my cry, and pay attention to what I'm asking. 
Lord, if you kept a list of sins, who could escape being condemned? 
But you are forgiving so that we might respect you. 
I'm waiting for the Lord, longingly waiting, for I trust in his word. 
I long for the Lord to come, more than watchmen longing for the dawn to come, more than watchmen longing for the dawn to come. 
Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for the Lord loves us with a trustworthy love and his salvation knows no limits. 
He will save Israel from every sin.
