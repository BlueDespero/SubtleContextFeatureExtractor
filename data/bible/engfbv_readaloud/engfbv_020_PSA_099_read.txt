Chapter 99.
The Lord reigns; let the nations tremble! He sits on his throne above the cherubim; let the earth shake! 
The Lord rules supreme in Zion, he is sovereign over all the nations. 
Let them praise his greatness, and respect him for who he is—for he is holy, 
having kingly power. You love justice; you make impartial decisions. You have made sure everything is done in fairness and according to what's right. 
Give respect to the Lord our God! Bow down at his feet, for he is holy! 
Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also prayed to him. They called out to the Lord for help, and he answered them. 
He spoke to the people from the pillar of cloud, and they kept the laws and decrees he gave them. 
Lord our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but you punished them when they did wrong. 
Honor the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain. For the Lord our God is holy!
