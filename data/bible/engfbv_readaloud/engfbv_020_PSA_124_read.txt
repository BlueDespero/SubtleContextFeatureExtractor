Chapter 124.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. A psalm of David. If the Lord hadn't been for us, what would have happened? Let everyone in Israel say: 
If the Lord hadn't been for us, what would have happened when people came and attacked us? 
They would have swallowed us alive when their anger raged against us. 
Like a flood they would have swept over us; like a rushing torrent they would have submerged us. 
They would have rushed over us like raging waters, drowning us. 
Praise the Lord, who didn't hand us over to them as prey to be ripped apart by their teeth. 
We escaped from them like a bird flying out of a hunter's trap. The trap was broken and we flew away! 
Our help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
