Chapter 148.
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from heaven; praise him in the heights above! 
Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly armies! 
Praise him, sun and moon! Praise him, all you shining stars! 
Praise him, highest heavens, and the waters above the heavens! 
Let them all praise the Lord and his nature, for he gave the order and they were created. 
He placed them in their positions forever and ever; he established a law that will never end. 
Praise the Lord from the earth, and creatures from all the depths of the seas, 
lightning and hail, snow and clouds, and stormy wind—everything that does as he commands. 
Mountains and all the hills, fruit trees and all the trees of the forest, 
wild animals and all livestock, crawling animals and wild birds, 
earthly kings and all peoples, leaders and rulers of the world, 
young men and women, old people and children— 
Let them all praise the Lord, for his reputation is unequalled; his glory is above anything on earth or in heaven. 
He has given his people a source of strength, bringing praise to his faithful followers, the people of Israel who are dear to him. Praise the Lord!
