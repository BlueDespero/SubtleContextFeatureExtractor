Chapter 7.
A psalm (shiggaion) of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, from the tribe of Benjamin. Lord my God, you are my protection. Save me from those who persecute me; please rescue me! 
Otherwise they will tear me apart like a lion, ripping me to pieces with no one to save me. 
If I have done what I'm accused of, if my hands are guilty, 
If I have paid back a friend with evil, if I have robbed my enemy for no reason, 
Then let my enemies chase me down; let them trample me in the dust and drag my reputation through the dirt. Selah. 
Stand up, Lord, in your anger, rise up against the fury of my enemies; wake up, Lord, and bring me justice! 
Bring together the nations before you; rule them from your throne on high. 
The Lord judges all people. Defend me, Lord, because I do what is right, because of my integrity. 
Please bring an end to the evil done by the wicked; vindicate those who do good, for you are the God of right who examines hearts and minds. 
The Most High God is my defense, the one who saves those who live right. 
God is a fair judge who is always hostile to evil. 
If people do not change their minds, he will sharpen his sword. He has bent and strung his bow. 
He has prepared weapons of death, he has his flaming arrows ready. 
See how the wicked conceive evil! They are pregnant with trouble. They give birth to dishonesty. 
They dig a deep hole to catch people, but then fall into it themselves. 
The trouble they cause rebounds to hit them on the head; their violence against others comes down on their own skulls. 
I will thank the Lord because he does what is right; I will sing praises to the name of the Lord Most High.
