1 Chronicles.
Chapter 12.
The following is a list of the men who joined David when he was at Ziklag, still hiding from Saul, son of Kish. They were some of the leading warriors who fought on David's side. 
They were all skilled archers, and could shoot arrows or slingshots with their right or their left hands. They were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin. 
Ahiezer was their leader, then Joash; the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 
Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, (a strong warrior among the Thirty, and leader over the Thirty); Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; 
Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam (they were Korahites); 
and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor. 
Some warriors from the tribe of Gad went over to David's side when he was at the stronghold in the desert. They were strong and experienced warriors, battle-hardened, experts in the use of shields and spears. Their faces looked as fierce as lions, and they ran as fast as gazelles in the mountains. 
Ezer the was the leader, Obadiah (second), Eliab (third), 
Mishmannah (fourth), Jeremiah (fifth), 
Attai (sixth), Eliel (seventh), 
Johanan (eighth), Elzabad (ninth), 
Jeremiah (tenth), Machbannai (eleventh). 
These warriors from Gad were army officers. The least able of them was in charge of 100 men; the best was in charge of 1,000. 
These were ones who crossed the Jordan River in the first month of the year when it overflows its banks. They chased out all the people living in the valley, both to the east and to the west. 
Some others from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah also came to join David at the stronghold. 
David went out to meet them and told them, “If you've come in peace to help me, we can be friends. But if you've come to betray me to my enemies, even though I've done no wrong, then may the God of our fathers see what you're doing and condemn you.” 
Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the leader of the Thirty. “We are yours, David, and we are with you, son of Jesse! May peace, prosperity, and success be yours and those who help you, for God is the one who is helping you.” So David allowed them to join him, and put them in charge of his bands of raiders. 
Others came over to David's side from the tribe of Manasseh and joined him when he went with Philistines to attack Saul. However, the Philistine rulers eventually decided to send them away, saying to themselves, “It will cost us our heads if he deserts us and goes over to his master Saul.” 
The following is a list of the men from Manasseh who went over to David's side as he returned to Ziklag: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of thousands in Manasseh. 
They helped David against raiders for they were all strong and experienced warriors and commanders in the army. 
Men arrived daily to help David until he had a large army, like the army of God. 
This is a list of the numbers of armed warriors who came and joined David in Hebron to turn over Saul's kingdom to him, as the Lord had said. 
From the tribe of Judah, 6,800 warriors carrying shields and spears. 
From the tribe of Simeon, 7,100 strong warriors. 
From the tribe of Levi, 4,600, 
including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, and with him 3,700, 
and Zadok, a strong young warrior, with 22 members of his family, all officers. 
From the tribe of Benjamin, from among Saul's relatives, 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul up until this time. 
From the tribe of Ephraim, 20,800 strong warriors, each highly regarded in his own clan. 
From the half-tribe of Manasseh, 18,000 men were designated by name to come and make David king. 
From the tribe of Issachar came leaders who knew and could understand the signs of the times and what Israel should do—a total of 200 leaders of the tribe together with their relatives. 
From the tribe of Zebulun, 50,000 warriors. They were fully armed and battle-ready, and totally dedicated. 
From the tribe of Naphtali, 1,000 officers and 37,000 warriors carrying shields and spears. 
From the tribe of Dan, 28,600 warriors, all battle-ready. 
From the tribe of Asher, 40,000 experienced warriors, all battle-ready. 
From the east side of the Jordan River, from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 120,000 warriors carrying all kinds of weapons. 
All these men came to Hebron dressed for battle, completely committed to making David king. All of Israel agreed that David should become king. 
They stayed three days there, eating and drinking together, for their relatives had provided them with supplies. 
Their neighbors, even as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, arrived bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They had plenty of flour, fig cakes, bunches of raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle, and sheep, for Israel was so happy.
