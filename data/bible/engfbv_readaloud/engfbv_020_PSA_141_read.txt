Chapter 141.
A psalm of David. Lord, I'm calling out to you! Please hurry up and help me! Please listen to me when I cry out to you! 
May my prayer be like incense before you, my uplifted hands like an evening offering. 
Lord, make sure I don't say anything I shouldn't—keep a watch over my conversations. 
Don't let me think about evil things or take part in doing anything wrong with wicked people. I won't join in eating fancy food at their feasts. 
Let a good person punish me in love—let them correct me. It will be like an anointing—I won't refuse it. But I still pray against those who do evil. 
They shall be thrown down by the power of the rock that judges them, and then they will recognize what I said was true! 
Just as the earth is broken up by the plough, so shall their bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 
But I'm looking to you, Lord God, for I find protection in you. Don't let me die! 
Keep me safe from the traps they have set to catch me, from the snares of evil people. 
Let them fall into their own traps while I pass by unharmed.
