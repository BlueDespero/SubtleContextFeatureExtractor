Chapter 108.
A song. A psalm of David. God, I have complete confidence in you! My whole being sings praises to you! 
Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn! 
I will thank you among the peoples, Lord, I will sing your praises among the nations. 
For your trustworthy love reaches higher than the heavens, your faithfulness is higher than the clouds. 
God, your greatness is above the highest heavens; and your glory is over all the earth! 
Rescue those you love! Answer us, and save us by your power! 
God has spoken from his Temple: “Triumphantly I divide up Shechem, and portion out the Valley of Succoth. 
Both Gilead and Manasseh belong to me. Ephraim is my helmet, and Judah is my scepter. 
I will treat Moab as my washbasin; I will place my sandal on Edom; I will shout in triumph over Philistia.” 
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me into Edom? 
Have you rejected us, God? Won't you go out with our armies? 
Please give us help against our enemies, for human help is worthless. 
Our strength is in God, and he will crush our enemies.
