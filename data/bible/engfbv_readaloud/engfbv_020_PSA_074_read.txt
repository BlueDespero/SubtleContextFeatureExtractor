PSALMS.
Chapter 74.
A psalm (maskil) of Asaph. God, why have you rejected us? Is it forever? Why does your anger burn so hot against the sheep of your own field? 
Remember the people you made your own long ago, the tribe you redeemed and made your own. Remember too Mount Zion, the place where you live. 
Come and walk through the complete devastation. The enemy has totally destroyed your Temple. 
The enemy shouted in triumph right where you met with us. There they set up their war banners as signs of their victory. 
They acted like men chopping down a forest with axes. 
With axes and hammers they smashed in the carved wooden panels. 
Then they set fire to your Temple, burning it to the ground. They defiled the place where you live, the place that bears your name. 
They said to themselves, “Let's destroy it all!” So they burned down every place where God was worshiped throughout the land. 
We no longer see any signs. There are no prophets left. And no one among us knows how long this will last. 
How long will the enemy ridicule you, God? Will they insult your character forever? 
Why do you hold back from doing something? Take action and destroy them! 
But you, God, are our king from long ago. You have saved us many times in the land. 
You were the one who split apart the sea by your strength; you broke the heads of the sea monsters. 
You were the one who crushed the heads of Leviathan, and you gave its body to the desert animals to eat. 
You were the one who made springs and rivers flow with water. You made permanent rivers dry up. 
You created the day, and also the night; you made the moon and the sun. 
You set the boundaries of the earth; you made summer and winter. 
So keep in mind how the enemy ridiculed you, Lord, and how irreverent people insulted your reputation. 
Don't let wild animals kill your turtledoves! Don't abandon your people forever! 
Remember your promises in the agreement, because the land is full of dark places and violence. 
Don't let those who suffer be mistreated again. Let the poor and needy praise you for you who are. 
Stand up, God, and plead your case. Don't forget how these foolish people insulted you all the time. 
Don't ignore what your enemies have said, for their loud accusations against you are getting worse and worse!
