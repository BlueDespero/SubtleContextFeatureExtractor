Chapter 116.
I love the Lord because he listens to me, he hears my calls for help. 
Because he pays attention to what I say I will pray to him as long as I live. 
I was caught in the snares of death; I was trapped by terrors of the grave. All I experienced was suffering and grief. 
Then I cried out to the Lord, “Lord, please save me!” 
The Lord is so kind and good! Our God is so compassionate! 
The Lord takes care of those who are powerless; when I was brought down he saved me. 
I can once again be at peace because the Lord has been good to me. 
For you have saved me from death, my eyes from crying, and my feet from stumbling. 
Now I can walk with the Lord in the land of the living. 
I trusted in you, so I told you, “I'm suffering terribly!” 
I was so upset that I said, “Everyone's a liar!” 
What can I give the Lord in return for all he's done for me? 
I will lift up the cup of salvation and worship the Lord. 
I will keep my promises to the Lord so everyone can see. 
It hurts the Lord when those who trust in him die. 
Lord, I really am your slave, serving you as my mother served you before me, yet you have set me free. 
I will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to you and I will worship you. 
I will keep my promises to the Lord so everyone can see, 
there in the house of the Lord, right in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
