Chapter 138.
A psalm of David. I thank you with my whole being; I sing your praises before the heavenly beings. 
I bow down before your holy Temple, and I am thankful because of who you are—for your trustworthy love and faithfulness—and for the fact that your promises are even greater than what people expect of you. 
On the day I cried out to you for help, you answered me. You encouraged me and made me strong. 
All the kings of the earth will praise you, Lord, for they have heard what you have said. 
They will sing about what the Lord has done and about the great glory of the Lord. 
Though the Lord is high above, he pays attention to the lowly; but he recognizes the proud a long way off. 
Even though I walk into a great deal of trouble, you protect me. You reach out to defend me from the anger of those who hate me—your strong hand saves me. 
The Lord vindicates me! Lord, your trustworthy love lasts forever! Don't give up on what you have made!
