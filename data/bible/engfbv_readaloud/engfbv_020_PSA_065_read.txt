Chapter 65.
For the music director. A psalm of David. A song. God, you deserve to be praised, and in Zion we will keep our promises to you. 
You hear our prayers; everyone comes to you. 
Even though we're drowning in our sins and our disobedience, you forgive us. 
Happy are those you choose to keep close to you, those who live in your courts! We are delighted with the blessings we receive in your house, your holy Temple! 
In your goodness you answer us through the wonderful things you do, God of our salvation. You can be trusted by everyone on earth, including those sailing distant oceans. 
You made the mountains by your power, for you have great strength. 
You calm the raging seas and crashing waves, you silence the noisy shouts of the nations. 
Everyone, even those in distant lands, are amazed by the wonderful things you do, from the east to the west they sing for joy. 
You care for the earth and water it; you make it very productive. God, your river is full of water to grow the grain—this is what you have planned. 
You fill the ploughed furrows with water, you soften the ridges; you bless the growing crops. 
You make the high point of the year a wonderful harvest, filling the wagons with good things. 
The pastures in the wilderness grow lush; the hillsides are clothed in bright flowers. 
The meadows are covered with flocks of sheep, and the valleys with fields of grain. Everything triumphantly sings for joy.
