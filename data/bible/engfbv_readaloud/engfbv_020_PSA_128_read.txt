Chapter 128.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. Happy are all those who worship the Lord, everyone who follows his ways! 
You will eat what your own hands have produced. You will be happy and do well. 
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine growing in your home. Your children will be like the shoots of an olive tree around your table. 
This will certainly be the Lord's blessing on those who worship him. 
May the Lord go on blessing you from Zion; may you see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life. 
May you see your children's children. May Israel be at peace!
