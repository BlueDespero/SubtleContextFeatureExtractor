Zechariah.
Chapter 2.
Then I looked again and I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
“Where are you going?” I asked him. “I'm going to Jerusalem to measure its width and length,” he replied. 
The angel I was talking to came forward and another angel came to meet him 
and told him, “Run, and tell the young man that Jerusalem will have so many people and farm animals that it will be too big to have walls.” 
The Lord declares, I myself will be a wall of fire all around the city, and I will be the glory inside it. 
Run! Run! Run away from the northern land, says the Lord, because I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven. 
Run away, people of Zion! All of you who live in Babylon must escape. 
For this is what the Lord Almighty said: Afterwards the glorious Lord sent me against the nations that plundered you—for those who touch you touch the apple of his eye. 
I will raise my hand against them and their former slaves will plunder them. Then you will know the Lord Almighty has sent me. 
Sing in celebration, people of Zion, for I am coming to live with you, declares the Lord. 
Many nations will become believers in Lord on that day, and they shall be my people. I will live among you, and you will know the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. 
The people of Judah will be the Lord's special people in the holy land, and he will once again choose Jerusalem as his special city. 
Be silent before the Lord, everyone, for he has risen from the holy place where he lives.
