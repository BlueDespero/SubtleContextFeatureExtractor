Hosea.
Chapter 11.
I loved Israel when he was a child. He's my son I called out of Egypt. 
As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baals and offered incense to idols. 
I myself taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the hand, but they didn't realize I was the one who healed them. 
I led them along with cords of kindness, with ropes of love. I was the one who eased their burden and bent down to feed them. 
However, because my people refuse to return to me, they will not return to the land of Egypt but Assyria shall be their king. 
War will sweep through their cities, putting an end to their boasting and destroying their plans. 
My people are hanging on to their apostasy from me. They call him “god on high” but he will not raise them up at all. 
How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I let you go, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is breaking; I am full of compassion. 
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God, not a human being. I am the Holy One living among you. I will not enter your cities. 
The people will follow me, the Lord. He will roar like a lion. When he roars like a lion then his children will come trembling from the west. 
Like a flock of frightened birds they will come from Egypt, like doves they will come from Assyria, and I will bring them back home, declares the Lord. 
Ephraim surrounds me with lies and Israel with deceit, and Judah still wanders with some deity, faithful to some “Holy One.”
