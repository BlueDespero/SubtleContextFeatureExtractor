Chapter 3.
A psalm of David concerning the time he had to flee from his son Absalom. Lord, my enemies have become so many; so many are rebelling against me. 
So many are telling me, “God can't save you!” Selah. 
But you, Lord, are a shield protecting me. You give me victory; you hold my head high. 
I cry out to the Lord for help, and he answers me from his holy mountain. Selah. 
I lie down to sleep, and in the morning I wake up because the Lord takes care of me. 
I'm not afraid of tens of thousands who surround me, people who are against me. 
Stand up for me, Lord! Save me, my God! Hit all my enemies on the cheek; break the teeth of the wicked! 
Salvation belongs to you, Lord; may you be a blessing to your people. Selah.
