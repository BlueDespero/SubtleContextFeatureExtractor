PSALMS.
Chapter 70.
For the music director. A psalm of David. For a memorial. God, save me! Hurry, Lord, help me! 
Please defeat and humiliate the people who are trying to kill me; turn back in disgrace those who want to hurt me. 
May they be shocked at their defeat, those who taunted me. 
But may everyone who comes to you be happy and glad; may those who love your salvation always say, “God is great!” 
As for me, I am poor and needy. Hurry, God, help me! Save me! Lord, don't wait!
