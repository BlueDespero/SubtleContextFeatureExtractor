Chapter 146.
Praise the Lord! With my whole being I praise the Lord! 
I will praise the Lord while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have breath. 
Don't put your confidence in human leaders—they cannot save you. 
Once they breathe no more, they go back to dust. On that very day everything they planned dies with them. 
Happy are those who have the God of Jacob to help them—their hope is in the Lord their God— 
the one who made heaven and earth, and the sea along with everything it contains. He is trustworthy forever. 
He makes sure the oppressed receive justice. He gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets the prisoners free. 
The Lord makes the blind see. The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down. The Lord loves those who do what is right. 
The Lord takes care of strangers among us. He looks after widows and orphans. But he makes life difficult for the wicked. 
The Lord will reign forever. Zion, he will be your God for all generations. Praise the Lord!
