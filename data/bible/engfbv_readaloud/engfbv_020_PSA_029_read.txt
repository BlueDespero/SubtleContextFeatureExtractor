Chapter 29.
A psalm of David. Honor the Lord, children of God, honor his glory and strength. 
Honor the Lord for his glorious character, bow in reverence to the Lord in his brilliant holiness. 
The Lord's voice sounds over the sea. The God of glory thunders. The Lord thunders over the vast ocean. 
The Lord's voice is powerful; the Lord's voice is majestic; 
the Lord's voice shatters the cedars, even breaking the cedars of Lebanon. 
He makes the mountains of Lebanon skip like a calf, and Mount Hermon like a young wild ox. 
The Lord's voice blazes out like lightning flashes. 
The Lord's voice causes an earthquake in the desert; the desert of Kadesh shakes. 
The Lord's voice makes the pregnant deer go into labor; it strips bare the forests. In his Temple all the worshipers shout, “Glory!” 
The Lord sits on his throne above the floodwaters; the Lord is the eternal King. 
The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord blesses them with peace.
