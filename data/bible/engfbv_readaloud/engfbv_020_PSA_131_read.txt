PSALMS.
Chapter 131.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. A psalm of David. Lord, I'm not proud or arrogant. I don't worry about things that are beyond me, matters that are far beyond my experience. 
On the contrary, I have chosen to be calm and quiet, like a weaned child with its mother. I am like a weaned child with its mother. 
Israel, hope in the Lord, now and forever!
