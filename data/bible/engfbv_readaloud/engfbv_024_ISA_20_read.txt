Isaiah.
Chapter 20.
In the year when Sargon, king of Assyria, sent his army commander to attack the town of Ashdod and conquered it, 
at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah, son of Amoz. He told him, “Take off the sackcloth clothes from your body and remove your sandals.” Isaiah did so and went around naked and barefoot. 
Then the Lord said, “In the same way that my servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a warning against Egypt and Ethiopia, 
so shall the king of Assyria lead the Egyptian prisoners and the Ethiopian exiles, both young and old, naked and barefoot. Their buttocks will be bare, to Egypt's shame. 
They will be discouraged and humiliated because they had put their hope in Ethiopia and proudly trusted in Egypt. 
At that time the people living in the coastal lands will say, ‘Look what has happened those we were depending on! We ran to them for help to save us from the king of Assyria. We don't stand a chance!’”
