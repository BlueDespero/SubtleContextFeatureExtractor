Chapter 84.
For the music director. A psalm of the descendants of Korah. On the gittith. How wonderful is the place where you live, Lord Almighty! 
I long, I ache, to be in the courts of the Lord. My mind and my body sing for joy to the living God. 
Even a sparrow finds a home there, and a swallow builds a nest for herself where she can raise her chicks near to your altars, Lord Almighty, my king and my God. 
How happy are those who live in your house—they are always praising you! Selah. 
How happy are those whose strength is in you, those who are determined to make a pilgrimage. 
As they walk through the Valley of Tears it becomes a spring of water; autumn rains cover it with pools. 
They go from strength to strength, and each one will appear before God in Jerusalem. 
Lord God Almighty, please hear my prayer; please listen, God of Jacob. Selah. 
Please God, look at our defender, look at the face of your anointed one. 
One day in your courts is better than a thousand anywhere else. I'd rather stand as a doorkeeper in the house of my God than live comfortably in the homes of the wicked. 
For the Lord God is our sun and shield, and he gives us grace and honor. The Lord doesn't hold back anything good from those who do right. 
Lord Almighty, how happy are those who trust in you.
