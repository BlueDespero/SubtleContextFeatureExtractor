Chapter 15.
A psalm of David. Who may enter your sanctuary, Lord? Who may come into your presence on your holy mountain? 
Those who live without fault and do what is right, those who sincerely tell the truth. 
They do not slander, do not treat their neighbors badly, do not gossip about people they know. 
They reject people the Lord has rejected, but honor those who follow the Lord. They keep their promises even when it's hard to do. They don't change their minds. 
They lend money without charging interest. They don't take bribes to testify against the innocent. Those who act like this will never ever fall.
