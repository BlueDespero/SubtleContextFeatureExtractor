PSALMS.
Chapter 101.
A psalm of David. I will sing of your faithful love and good judgment. I will sing praises to you, Lord. 
I will make sure my life is blameless. When will you come and help me? My life will be one of integrity even in private. 
I will not look at anything evil. I hate doing wrong—I won't have anything to do with it. 
I won't think bad thoughts—I won't even consider anything evil. 
I will silence anyone who secretly slanders their neighbor. I won't tolerate anyone who is proud and arrogant. 
I look for faithful people to live with me; only those who are trustworthy will serve me. 
No one who is dishonest will live in my house; no liars will be allowed in my presence. 
I work every day to silence the wicked in the land, to rid the city of the Lord of all who do evil.
