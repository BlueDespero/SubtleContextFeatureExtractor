Nehemiah.
Chapter 7.
Once the wall had been rebuilt and I had put up the doors, I appointed the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites. 
I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, together with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, because he was an honest man who respected God more than many others. 
I told them, “Don't allow the gates of Jerusalem to be opened until the sun is hot, and make sure the guards shut and bolt the doors while they're still on duty. Appoint some of the residents of Jerusalem as guards, to be at their posts, standing in front of their own houses.” 
In those times the city was large with plenty of space, but there weren't many people in it, and the houses hadn't been rebuilt. 
My God encouraged me to have everyone—the nobles, the officials, and the people—all come to be registered according to their family genealogy. I found the genealogical register of those who had returned first. This what I discovered written there. 
This is a list of the people of the province who returned from the captivity. These were the exiles who had been taken away to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, to their home towns. 
They were led by Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. This is the number of men of the people of Israel: 
The sons of Parosh, 2,172; 
the sons of Shephatiah, 372; 
the sons of Arah, 652; 
the sons of Pahath-moab, (the sons of Jeshua and Joab), 2,818;

the sons of Azgad, 2,322; 
the sons of Adonikam, 667; 
the sons of Bigvai, 2,067. 
The sons of Adin, 655.

This is the number of the priests: the sons of Jedaiah (through the family of Jeshua), 973; 
the sons of Immer, 1,052; 
the sons of Pashhur, 1,247; 
the sons of Harim, 1,017. 
This is the number of the Levites: the sons of Jeshua through Kadmiel (sons of Hodaviah), 74; 
the singers of the sons of Asaph, 148; 
the gatekeepers of the families of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai, 138. 
The descendants of these Temple servants: Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth, 
Keros, Sia, Padon, 
Lebanah, Hagabah, Shalmai, 
Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, 
Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, 
Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, 
Besai, Meunim, Nephusim, 
Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, 
Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha, 
Barkos, Sisera, Temah, 
Neziah, and Hatipha. 
The descendants of King Solomon's servants: Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, 
Jaala, Darkon, Giddel, 
Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-Hazzebaim and Amon. 
The total of the Temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants was 392. 
Those who came from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer could not prove their family genealogy, or even that they were descendants of Israel. 
They included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 642 in total. 
In addition there three priestly families, sons of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (Barzillai had married a woman descended from Barzillai of Gilead, and he was called by that name.) 
They searched for a record of them in the genealogies, but their names weren't found, so they were barred from serving as priests. 
The governor instructed them not to eat anything from the sanctuary sacrifices until a priest could ask the Lord about the issue by using the Urim and Thummim. 
The total of number of people returning was 42,360. 
In addition there were 7,337 servants and 245 male and female singers. 
They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. 
Some of the family leaders made voluntary contributions toward the work. The governor presented to the treasury 1,000 gold darics, 50 bowls and 530 sets of clothes for the priests. 
Some of the family leaders donated to the treasury for the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver. 
The rest of the people donated 20,000 gold darics, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 sets of clothes for the priests. 
The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, and Temple servants, as well as some of the people and the rest of the Israelites, went back to live in their specific towns. By the seventh month the Israelites were living in their towns,
