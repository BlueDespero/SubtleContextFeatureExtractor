Deuteronomy.
Chapter 26.
Once you've entered the country that the Lord your God is giving you to own, and you take it over and settle there, 
take some of the firstfruits of all your crops produced by the land that the Lord your God is giving you and place them in a basket. Then go to the place the Lord your God will choose to live with you, 
and tell the priest in charge at the time, “Today I declare to the Lord your God that I now live in the country that the Lord promised our forefathers to give us.” 
The priest will take the basket from you and place it in front of the altar of the Lord your God. 
Then this is what you are to publicly declare before the Lord your God, “My father was a Aramean who moved from place to place. There were only a few of them when he and his family went to live in Egypt. But they became a large and powerful nation. 
But the Egyptians treated us very badly, oppressing us and forcing us to do hard labor. 
We cried out for help to the Lord, the God of our forefathers; and the Lord answered us as he saw how much we were suffering, forced to work so hard in such cruelty. 
The Lord led us out of Egypt with his great power and incredible strength and terrifying actions, signs and miracles. 
He brought us here and gave us this country, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
Look, Lord! I have brought you the firstfruits of the land that you have given me.” You shall place the basket before the Lord your God and bow down in worship before him. 
Then you, the Levites, and the foreigners who live with you are to celebrate all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your family. 
Once you've finished storing up a tenth of all your crops in the third year, (the year of the tithe), you shall give it to the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, so they will have enough to eat in your towns. 
Then you are to make this declaration in the presence of the Lord your God: “I have brought the holy tithe and I have given it to the Levite, the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows as you have ordered me to do. I have not broken or forgotten your commandments. 
I have not eaten any of the holy tithe while in mourning, or taken any of it while I was unclean, or used any of it as an offering for the dead. I have obeyed the Lord my God. I have done everything you ordered me to do. 
Please look down from your home in heaven, and bless your people the Israelites and the country you have given us as you promised our fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey.” 
Today the Lord your God orders you to carry out these rules and regulations. Make sure you follow them with all your mind and with all your being. 
Today you have publicly declared that the Lord is your God and that you will follow his ways, keep rules and commandments and regulations, and obey what he says. 
Today the Lord has announced that you are a special people who belong to him as he promised. He has announced that you are to keep all his commandments. 
He has announced that he will give you greater praise and reputation and honor than any other nation he has made. He has announced that you will be a holy people to the Lord your God, as he promised.
