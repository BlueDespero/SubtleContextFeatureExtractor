Chapter 112.
Praise the Lord! Happy are those who respect the Lord, who love to do what he says! 
Their descendants will prosper in the land; the children of those who do good will be blessed. 
Their families will be wealthy; the good they do has eternal results. 
Light shines in the darkness for those who live right, for those who are gracious, compassionate, and good. 
Good things come to those who are generous in their lending and are honest in doing business. 
They will never fall. Those who live right won't be forgotten. 
They aren't afraid of bad news because they rely totally on the Lord. 
They are confident and brave, and see their enemies defeated. 
They share generously, giving to the poor; the good they do has eternal results. They are greatly respected. 
The wicked observe all this and are mad; they gnash their teeth in anger. They waste away, and all that they hoped for comes to nothing.
