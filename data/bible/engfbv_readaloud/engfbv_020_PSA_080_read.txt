Chapter 80.
For the music director. A psalm of Asaph. To the tune “Lilies of the Covenant.” Please hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead the descendants of Joseph like a flock. You who sit on your throne above the cherubim, shine out 
in the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Gather together your power and come to save us! 
God, please restore us! Let your face shine on us so we can be saved. 
Lord God Almighty, how long will you be angry with the prayers of your people? 
You fed them with the bread of tears, and gave them a full bowl of tears to drink. 
You turn us into victims our neighbors fight over; our enemies mock us. 
God Almighty, please restore us! Let your face shine on us so we can be saved! 
You carried us out of Egypt like a vine. You drove out the heathen nations, and then you planted the vine. 
You prepared the ground for the vine. It took root and filled the land. 
The mountains were covered by its shade; its branches covered the great cedars. 
It sent its branches as far west as the Mediterranean Sea, and its shoots as far east as the Euphrates River. 
So why have you broken down the walls that protect it so that everyone who passes by can steal its fruit? 
Wild pigs from the forest eat it, wild animals feed on it. 
God Almighty, please return to us! Look down from heaven and see what's happening to us! Come and care for this vine 
that you planted yourself, this son that you brought up yourself. 
We, your vine, have been chopped down and burned. May those who did this die when you glare at them. 
Protect the man who stands beside you; strengthen the son you have chosen. 
Then we will not turn away from you. Revive us so we can pray to you. 
Lord God Almighty, please restore us! Let your face shine on us so we can be saved.
