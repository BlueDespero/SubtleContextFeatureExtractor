Chapter 19.
For the music director. A psalm of David. The heavens declare God's glory; the skies above announce what he has made. 
Each day speaks constantly about God's glory to the next day; each night shares knowledge of God with the next night. 
They speak without speech or words; their voice is not audible; 
Yet what they say is heard all over the earth; their message goes to the whole world. God has made a home in the heavens for the sun. 
It's like a bridegroom coming out of his room, like a fit athlete happy to run a race. 
It rises on one side of the heavens and travels across to the other. Nothing is hidden from its heat. 
The Lord's law is beneficial, renewing spiritual life. The Lord's teaching is trustworthy, making inexperienced people wise. 
The Lord's instructions are right, making people glad. The Lord's commandments are sincere, helping people see what is good. 
Reverence for the Lord is right, and lasts forever. The Lord's judgments are both true and fair. 
They are more to be valued than gold, even the finest gold; they are sweeter than honey, even the purest honey coming straight from the honeycomb. 
They also warn your servant. By keeping them I'm richly rewarded. 
Who's aware of their own mistakes? Don't punish me for these faults I'm unaware of. 
Don't let your servant commit deliberate sins. Don't let them rule over me. Then I will be without fault, innocent of such rebellion. 
May you be pleased with the words I speak, and the thoughts I think, Lord my rock and my redeemer.
