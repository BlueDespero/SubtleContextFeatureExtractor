Chapter 113.
Praise the Lord! Praise him, servants of the Lord! Praise the Lord's as he is! 
Let the Lord's nature be praised, now and forever. 
Let everyone everywhere, from the east to the west, praise the Lord as he is! 
The Lord rules supreme over all nations; his glory extends higher than the heavens. 
Who is like the Lord our God? He is the one who lives on high, seated on his throne. 
He has to stoop low to look down on the heavens and the earth. 
He helps the poor up from the dust; he lifts the needy from the dump. 
He gives them positions of honor together important leaders, with leaders of his own people. 
He makes the childless woman happy in her home by giving her children. Praise the Lord!
