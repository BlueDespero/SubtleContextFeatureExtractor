Chapter 2.
The Lord told Moses and Aaron, 
“The Israelites are to set up their camp around the Tent of Meeting but some distance from it. Every member of each tribe will camp under their own flag and family banner. 
The tribal division of Judah is to camp under their flag on the east side. Their leader is Nahshon, son of Amminadab, 
and he has 74,600 men. 
The tribe of Issachar will camp next to them. Their leader is Nethanel, son of Zuar, 
and he has 54,400 men. 
Next is the tribe of Zebulun. Their leader is Eliab, son of Helon, 
and he has 57,400 men. 
So the total number of men in the area of the camp of Judah is 186,400. When it's time to march out, they are the ones who will lead. 
The tribal division of Reuben is to camp under their flag on the south side. Their leader is Elizur, son of Shedeur, 
and he has 46,500 men. 
The tribe of Simeon will camp next to them. Their leader is Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai, 
and he has 59,300 men. 
Next is the tribe of Gad. Their leader is Eliasaph, son of Deuel, 
and he has 45,650 men. 
So the total number of men in the area of the camp of Reuben is 151,450. They shall march out in second place. 
The Tent of Meeting which is stands at the center of the camp is to accompany the Levites. They are to march out in the same order as they set up camp, each in their rightful place under their flag. 
The tribal division of Ephraim is to camp under their flag on the west side. Their leader is Elishama, son of Ammihud, 
and he has 40,500 men. 
The tribe of Manasseh will camp next to them. Their leader is Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, 
and he has 32,200 men. 
Next is the tribe of Benjamin. Their leader is Abidan, son of Gideoni, 
and he has 35,400 men. 
So the total number of men in the area of the camp of Ephraim is 108,100. They shall march out in third place 
The tribal division of Dan is to camp under their flag on the north side. Their leader is Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai, 
and he has 62,700 men. 
The tribe of Asher will camp next to them. Their leader is Pagiel, son of Ocran, 
and he has 41,500 men. 
Next is the tribe of Naphtali. Their leader is Ahira son of Enan, 
and he has 53,400 men. 
So the total number of men in the area of the camp of Dan is 157,600;. They shall march out in last, with their flags.” 
This is sums up the registration of the Israelites, carried out by family. The final total of those counted in the camps by their tribal division was 603,550. 
However, the Levites were not counted among the other Israelites, following the Lord's instructions to Moses. 
The Israelites did everything the Lord had ordered Moses. They set up their camps under their flags in their assigned positions, and marched out in the same order, each with their own tribe and family.
