Chapter 62.
For Jeduthun, the music director. A psalm of David. Only in God do I find peace; my salvation comes from him. 
He is the one who protects me and saves me; he keeps me safe so I will never be in danger. 
How long are you going to attack me? All of you against one man! To you I'm just a broken wall, a collapsed fence. 
They plan to throw me down from my high position; they love to tell lies. They say nice things to me, but inside they're cursing me. Selah. 
Only in God do I find peace; my hope comes from him. 
He is the one who protects me and saves me; he keeps me safe so I will not be in danger. 
My salvation and my success come from God alone; God is my security and my protection. 
My people, always trust in him. Pour out all your thoughts to him, for he is the one who looks after us. Selah. 
Ordinary people are mere breaths, while leaders are just fakes. Put them all together and weigh them on scales and they wouldn't weigh more than air! 
Don't trust in money made by extortion or robbery. Don't be proud of your wealth even if you are successful—don't make money what you live for. 
God has already made it clear—I have heard it many times—power belongs to you, God. 
You show us trustworthy love. You give back to people in return for what they've done.
