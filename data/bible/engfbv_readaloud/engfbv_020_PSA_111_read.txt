Chapter 111.
Praise the Lord! I will thank the Lord with all my heart in the congregation of the faithful. 
All the wonderful things the Lord has done are studied by everyone who loves them. 
His majesty and honor are revealed by what he does; his goodness lasts forever. 
He wants the wonderful things he has done to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and kind. 
He feeds those who respect him; he always remembers the agreement he made. 
He demonstrated to his people the powerful things he could do by giving them the lands of other nations. 
Everything he does can be depended on, and is right; all his commandments are trustworthy. 
They remain rock-solid forever. He was true and right in saying what should be done. 
He delivered his people. He commanded that his agreement would continue forever. How holy and awesome is his reputation! 
The beginning of wisdom is honoring the Lord. Those who follow what he says do well. He is to be praised forever!
