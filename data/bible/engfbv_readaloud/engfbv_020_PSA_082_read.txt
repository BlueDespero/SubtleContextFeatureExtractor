Chapter 82.
A psalm of Asaph. God stands in the midst of his great assembly to judge among the gods. 
How long will you make unfair judgments and show favoritism to the wicked? Selah. 
Defend the poor and orphans; support the rights of those who are oppressed and suffering. 
Rescue the poor and those unable to help themselves; save them from the clutches of evil people. 
They don't have any wisdom; they live in the dark; the foundations of the earth are shaken. 
I say, “You are gods; all of you are children of the Most High. 
But you will die like any human being, you will fall like any other leader.” 
Stand up, Lord, and judge the earth, for all the nations belong to you.
