Chapter 25.
A psalm of David. Lord, I come to worship you. 
I trust in you, my God. Don't let me be humiliated, and don't let my enemies triumph over me. 
No one who trusts in you will be humiliated, but humiliation comes to those who are deliberately dishonest. 
Show me your ways, Lord; teach me to follow your paths. 
Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation. All day long I put my trust in you. 
Remember, Lord, your compassion and trustworthy love—they are eternal! 
Please don't remember the sins of my youth when I rebelled against you. Instead, remember me according to your trustworthy love, remember me because of your goodness, Lord. 
The Lord is good and he is right; that is why he shows the way to those who are lost. 
He leads those who are humble in doing what's right, teaching them his way. 
The Lord's paths are those of trustworthy love and truth for those who keep his agreement and do as he says. 
Lord, because of your nature, forgive my many sins. 
Who are those who respect the Lord? He will show them the path to choose. 
They will continue to be prosperous, and their descendants will inherit the land. 
The Lord is friends with those who respect him, explaining to them his agreement. 
I always look to the Lord, for he rescues me when I'm trapped. 
Watch over me and be good to me, because I am all alone and suffering. 
My problems get bigger and bigger. Please save me from all I'm going through. 
See all my troubles and trials. Please forgive my sins. 
Look at how many enemies I have, and how they really hate me! 
Please look after me and save me! Don't let me be humiliated, for you are the one who protects me. 
May integrity and honesty defend me because I place my confidence in you. 
God, please deliver the people of Israel from all their troubles!
