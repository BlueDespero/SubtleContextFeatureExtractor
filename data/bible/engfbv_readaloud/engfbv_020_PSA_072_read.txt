Chapter 72.
A psalm of Solomon. God, please give the king fairness, and give the king's son the ability to do what's right. 
May he rightly judge your people, and may he be fair to the poor. 
May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills bring goodness. 
May he defend the poor and save their children, may he crush those who oppress them. 
May they respect him as long as the sun and the moon shine above, for all generations. 
May his reign be like rain falling on new grass, like showers that water the earth. 
May those who live right prosper under his rule; may there be great prosperity until the moon is no more. 
May he rule from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth. 
Desert tribes will kneel before him; and his enemies will bite the dust. 
The kings of Tarshish and the islands will bring him tribute; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present him with gifts. 
Every king will bow down to him; every nation will serve him. 
He will help the poor when they cry out to him, and help those who are suffering that have no one to support them. 
He has pity on the poor and needy—he saves their lives! 
He rescues them from violence and oppression, for their lives mean so much to him. 
May he live long! May the gold from Sheba be given to him. May people always pray for him and bless him all day long. 
May there be plenty of grain in the land, even growing on mountain-tops. May the fruit on the trees sway like the trees of Lebanon. May the people in the city flourish like grass in a field. 
May his fame live forever, may it last as long as the sun. May all nations be blessed through him, and may they praise him. 
Praise the Lord God, the God of Israel, who is the only one who can do such fantastic things! 
Praise his wonderful nature forever! May the whole world be full of his glory! Amen and amen! 
(This is the end of the psalms of David, son of Jesse.)
