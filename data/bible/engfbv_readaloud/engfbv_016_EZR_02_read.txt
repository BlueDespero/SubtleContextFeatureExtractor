The total of the Temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants was 392. 
Those who came from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer could not prove their family genealogy, or even that they were descendants of Israel. 
They included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, 652 in total. 
In addition there three priestly families, sons of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (Barzillai had married a woman descended from Barzillai of Gilead, and he was called by that name.) 
They searched for a record of them in the genealogies, but their names weren't found, so they were barred from serving as priests. 
The governor instructed them not to eat anything from the sanctuary sacrifices until a priest could ask the Lord about the issue by using the Urim and Thummim. 
The total of number of people returning was 42,360. 
In addition there were 7,337 servants and 200 male and female singers. 
They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. 
When they arrived at the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders made voluntary contributions toward the rebuilding of God's Temple where it had once stood. 
They gave depending on how much they had, putting their gift into the treasury. The total came to 61,000 gold daric coins, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 robes for the priests. 
The priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the Temple servants, as well as some of the people went back to live in their specific towns. The others returned to their own towns throughout Israel.
