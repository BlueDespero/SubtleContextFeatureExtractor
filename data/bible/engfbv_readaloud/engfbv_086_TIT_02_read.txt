Titus.
Chapter 2.
You, however, must teach what is consistent with healthy beliefs. 
Older men shouldn't drink; they should be respectable and sensible, with a healthy trust in God, loving and patient. 
Similarly older women ought to behave in a way that shows they live their lives for God. They shouldn't destroy people's reputations by what they say, and they shouldn't be addicted to wine. 
They should be teachers of what's good, teaching the young wives to love their husbands and their children. 
They are to be sensible and pure, working in their homes, doing good and listening to what their husbands tell them. In this way the word of God will not be spoken about badly. 
Likewise tell the young men to be sensible. 
You should set an example of doing good in all areas of life: show integrity and seriousness in what you teach, 
sharing healthy beliefs that can't be criticized. In this way those who are opposed will be ashamed of themselves and won't have anything bad to say about us. 
Tell servants to always obey their masters. They should try to please them and not talk back to them. 
They shouldn't steal things for themselves, but show they are completely trustworthy so that they may rightly represent the truth about God our Savior in every way. 
For God's grace has been revealed, bringing salvation to everyone. 
It teaches us to reject a godless way of life with the desires of this world. Instead we should live thoughtful, self-controlled lives that are right before God in the present world 
as we look for the wonderful hope of the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. 
He gave himself for us, so that he could set us free from all our wickedness, and to make us clean for him—a people who belong to him, keen to do good. 
This is what you should be teaching. You have the authority to encourage and to correct as necessary. Don't let anyone look down on you.
