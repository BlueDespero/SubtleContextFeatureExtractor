PSALMS.
Chapter 92.
A psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. How good it is to thank the Lord, to sing praises to you, Most High, 
to tell of your trustworthy love in the morning, and your faithfulness in the night, 
to the music of a ten-stringed harp and the melody of a lyre. 
You've made me so happy, Lord, because of all you've done for me! I sing for joy at what you've done! 
Lord, what you do is amazing; your thoughts are very profound! 
Only senseless people and fools don't know and understand this: 
even though the wicked grow up quickly like grass, and even though people who do evil flourish, they will be destroyed forever! 
But you, Lord, rule on high forever. 
Your enemies, Lord, your enemies will die; everyone who does evil will be destroyed! 
But you have made me as powerful as a wild bull; you have anointed me with the best olive oil. 
My eyes look with pleasure to see my enemies defeated; my ears have heard the downfall of those who tried to attack me. 
Those who live right flourish like a palm tree; they grow tall like a cedar tree in Lebanon. 
They are planted in the house of the Lord; they thrive in the courts of our God. 
Even when they are old they will still produce fruit, staying fresh and green. 
They will declare, “The Lord does what is right! He is my rock! There is no wrong in him!”
