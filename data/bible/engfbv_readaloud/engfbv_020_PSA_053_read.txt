PSALMS.
Chapter 53.
For the music director. According to Mahalath. A psalm (maskil) of David. Only fools tell themselves, “God doesn't exist.” They are completely immoral, they commit terrible sins, not a single one of them does anything good. 
God watches from heaven to see if anyone understands, if anyone wants to come to God. 
They have all fallen away, they are totally depraved; none of them does anything good, not even one. 
“Won't these people who do evil ever learn? They consume my people as if they were eating bread, and refuse to pray to me.” 
They will become completely terrified, more frightened than they have ever been. God will scatter the bones of those who fight against you; you will defeat them because God has rejected them. 
If only God's salvation would come from Zion! When God restores his people, the people of Jacob will celebrate, and the people of Israel will be glad.
