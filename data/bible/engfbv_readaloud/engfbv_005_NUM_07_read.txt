Numbers.
Chapter 7.
On the same day that Moses finished putting up the Tabernacle, he anointed it and dedicated it, along with all its furniture, the altar, and all its utensils. 
The Israelite leaders who were the heads of their families came and gave an offering. They were the same leaders of the tribes who had worked on the registration of the Israelites. 
They brought to the Lord an offering of six covered wagons and twelve oxen. Each leader gave an ox, and two leaders shared in giving a wagon. They presented them in front of the Tabernacle. 
The Lord told Moses, 
“Accept what they're giving you and use them in the work of the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites to use as required.” 
Moses accepted the wagons and oxen and handed them over to the Levites. 
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the families of Gershon to use as they required. 
He gave four wagons and eight oxen to the families of Merari, to use as they required. The work was all to be done under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. 
He didn't give any wagons or oxen to the Kohathites because their responsibility was to carry on their shoulders the holy objects assigned to their care. 
The day the altar was anointed, the leaders came forward with their dedicatory offerings, presenting them in front of it. 
The Lord told Moses, “Have one leader come every day and present his offering for the dedication of the altar.”
