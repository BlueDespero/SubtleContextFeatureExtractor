Job.
Chapter 40.
God continued speaking to Job. 
“Are you still going to fight with the Almighty and try to set him straight? Anyone who argues with God must give some answers.” 
Job answered the Lord, 
“Me—I am nothing at all. I have no answers. I put my hand in front of my mouth. 
I have already said far too much and I won't say anything more.” 
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, 
“Prepare yourself, be strong, for I am going to question you, and you must answer me. 
Are you really going to say my decisions are wrong? Are you going to condemn me so you can be right? 
Are you as powerful as I am? Does your voice thunder like mine? 
Why don't you dress yourself with majesty and dignity, and clothe yourself with glory and splendor! 
Let loose your fierce anger. Humble the proud with a glance. 
Bring down the proud with your gaze; tread the wicked underfoot right where they are. 
Bury them in the dust; lock them away in the grave. 
Then I will also agree that your own strength can save you. 
Consider Behemoth, a creature I made just like I made you. It eats grass like cattle. 
Look at its powerful loins, the muscles of its belly. 
It bends its tail like a cedar; its thigh sinews are strong. 
Its bones are like bronze tubes; its limbs like iron rods. 
It is the most important example of what God can do; only the one who made it can approach it with a sword. 
The hills produce food for it, and all the wild animals play there. 
It lies under the lotus; it hides in the reeds of the marsh. 
The lotus covers it with shade; the willow trees of the valley surround it. 
Even if the river is in flood, it is not concerned; it remains calm when the Jordan river surges against it. 
No one can catch it while it is watching, or pierce its nose with a noose.
