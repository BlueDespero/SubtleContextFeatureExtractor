Chapter 32.
A psalm of David. How happy are those whose wrongs are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 
How happy are those whose sins the Lord does not count against them, those who do not act deceptively. 
When I kept quiet, my body fell apart as I groaned in distress all day long. 
You beat me day and night, my strength dried up as in the heat of summer. Selah. 
Then I confessed my sins to you. I did not hide the wrongs I had done. I said to myself, “I will confess my disobedience to the Lord,” and you forgave the guilt of my sins. Selah. 
Therefore let all who are faithful pray to you while there's time, so when trouble comes in like a flood it will not overwhelm them. 
For you are my refuge, you protect me from trouble. You surround me with songs of salvation. Selah. 
“I will instruct you, teaching you the way to follow. I will advise you, watching out for you. 
You mustn't be like a horse or a mule that doesn't know which way to go without a bit or a bridle. Otherwise they can't be controlled.” 
The wicked have many problems, but those who trust in the Lord will be surrounded by his never-failing love. 
So be happy in the Lord and celebrate, you who do good. Shout for joy, all you who live right!
