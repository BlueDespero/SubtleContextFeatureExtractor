Job.
Chapter 32.
Job's three friends stopped responding to him because he kept on protesting his innocence. 
Then Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, grew angry. He was angry with Job for claiming he was right rather than God. 
Elihu was also angry at Job's three friends because they made it seem that God was wrong, because they had not been able to answer Job. 
Elihu had waited to for the other three to speak with Job since they were older than he was. 
But when he saw that they could not answer Job, he grew very angry. 
Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, said, “I am young, and you are old, which is why I was reluctant to tell you what I know. 
I told myself, ‘Those who are older should speak—those who are elderly should teach wisdom.’ 
However, there is a spirit in human beings, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding. 
It is not the old who are wise, or the elderly who know what is right. 
That's why I'm telling you to listen to me now—let me tell you what I know. 
Well, I waited to hear what you had to say, listening for your insights as you looked for the right words to speak. 
I paid close attention to all of you, and none of you have proved Job wrong or answered his arguments. 
Don't say to yourselves, ‘We are so wise,’ for God will prove him wrong, not a human being. 
Job didn't line up his arguments against me, and I won't answer him the way you did. 
You sit there speechless with nothing left to say. 
Should I continue to wait since you're no longer talking, just standing there saying nothing? 
No—now I'll give my answer too. I'll tell you what I know. 
I have so much to say I can't hold the words back! 
Inside I'm like fermenting wine all bottled up; like new wineskins ready to explode! 
I have to speak before I burst; I will open my lips to answer him. 
I will not take sides, and I'm not going to flatter anyone. 
I don't know how to flatter, and if I did my Creator would soon destroy me.
