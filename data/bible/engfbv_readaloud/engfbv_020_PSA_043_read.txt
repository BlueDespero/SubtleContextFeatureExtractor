Chapter 43.
God, please vindicate me! Plead my case against an unfaithful nation; save me from these wicked and dishonest people. 
For you, God, are my protection—so why have you turned your back on me? Why must I go around weeping because of the attacks of my enemies? 
Send your light and your truth so they can guide me; let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the place where you live. 
I will go to God's altar, to God who makes me truly happy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God. 
Why am I so discouraged? Why do I feel so sad? I will hope in God; I will praise him because he is the one who saves me—my God!
