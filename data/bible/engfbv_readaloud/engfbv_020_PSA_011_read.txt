Chapter 11.
For the music director: A psalm of David. Lord, you are my protection. So how can you tell me, “Fly away to the mountains like a bird”? 
Look, the wicked are drawing their bows, loading them with arrows ready to shoot from the shadows at good people. 
When the foundations of society are destroyed, what can those who live right do? 
The Lord is in his Temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven. He keeps a close eye on everyone, watching them carefully. 
The Lord examines both those who do right and those who do evil, but he hates those who love violence. 
He will make blazing coals and sulfur rain down on the wicked; a scorching wind is what's coming on them. 
The Lord does what is right, and he loves those who live right. Those who do good will see him face to face.
