Revelation.
Chapter 3.
“Write this to the angel of the Sardis church: This is what the one who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says: I know what you have accomplished, and that you give the appearance of being alive—but in reality you are dead. 
Wake up, and try to revive what is left that's about to die! For I have discovered that from the perspective of my God, nothing you've done has been finished. 
So remind yourselves of how this message came to you, and what you heard. Observe what you were told to do, and repent. If you don't watch out, I'll come unexpectedly like a thief, and you won't know at what time I'll come to you! 
But there are some among you in Sardis who have not ruined their clothes, and they will walk with me dressed in white, for they deserve to do so. 
Those who are victorious will be dressed in white like this. Their names will not be removed from the book of life, and I will speak for them in the presence of my Father and his angels. 
If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit is telling the churches. 
Write this to the angel of the Philadelphia church: This is what the one says, the one who is holy and true, who has the key of David. He can open and nobody is able to shut, he can shut, and nobody is able to open: 
I know what you have accomplished—look, I've opened a door for you that no one can shut. I know that you only have a little strength, but you did what I told you, and you did not deny me. 
From Satan's synagogue I will bring those who say they are Jews, (but are not, they are liars), making them come and worship at your feet, so that they will acknowledge that I love you. 
Because you have persevered as I told you to, I will take care of you during the testing time that is coming on the whole world when those who live on the earth will be on trial. 
I am coming soon! Keep a tight grasp on what you have, so that no one takes your crown. 
Those who are victorious I will make into pillars in the Temple of my God. They won't ever have to leave. I will write on them the name of my God, the name of the city of my God called New Jerusalem which descends from heaven from my God, and my own new name. 
If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit is telling the churches. 
Write this to the angel of the Laodicea church: This is what the Amen says, who is the faithful, true witness, highest ruler of God's creation: 
I know what you have accomplished—you're neither hot nor cold. I wish you were hot or cold! 
But because you're lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I'm going to spit you out of my mouth. 
You say to yourselves, ‘I'm rich, I have wealth, and don't need anything.’ But you don't know that you are miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked. 
I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so you may be rich; and have white clothes so you can be properly dressed and you won't reveal your nakedness and shame; and ointment to put on your eyes so you can see. 
Those I love I correct and discipline. So be really sincere, and repent. 
Look, I'm standing at the door, knocking. If anyone hears me calling and opens the door, I will come in and eat with them, and they with me. 
I will have those who are victorious sit down with me beside my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down beside my Father on his throne. 
If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit is telling the churches.”
