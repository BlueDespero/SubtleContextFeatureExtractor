Zechariah.
Chapter 3.
Then the Lord showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing on his right accusing him. 
And the Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebukes you Satan. I, the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you. Isn't he like a half-burned stick snatched from the fire?” 
Joshua was wearing filthy clothes as he stood in front of the angel. 
The angel said to those standing there, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See how I have taken away your sins from you, and now I am dressing you with fine clothes.” 
Then I said, “Wrap a clean turban around his head.” So they wrapped a clean turban around his head and put the clothes on him while the angel of the Lord stood there. 
Then the angel of the Lord solemnly advised Joshua, saying, 
“This is what the Lord Almighty says: If you follow my ways and observe my commands, then you will govern my Temple and its courtyards. I will allow you to walk among those standing here. 
Pay attention, high priest Joshua and all your fellow-priests that you teach! You are a sign of good things to come. Look! I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 
See that I have placed a precious stone in front of Joshua, a single stone with seven faces. Watch, for I myself am going to engrave seven eyes on it, declares the Lord Almighty, and I will wipe away the sins of this land in a single day. 
On that day everyone will invite their friends to sit in peace under their vines and fig trees, says the Lord Almighty.”
