1 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
So when we couldn't bear it any longer, we decided it would be best for us to stay behind in Athens, 
and send Timothy on to you. He is our brother and God's co-worker in spreading the good news of Christ. We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your trust in God 
so that none of you would be upset by your troubles—for you know we should expect such things. 
Even while we were with you we kept on warning you that we would suffer persecution soon— and as you well know that is exactly what has happened. 
This is why, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I sent to find out whether you were still trusting in God. I was concerned that the Devil had successfully tempted you and that all our work had been for nothing! 
Now Timothy has just returned from visiting you and he has brought us good news of your trust in God and the love you have. He's told us that you still have fond memories of us, longing to see us just as we long to see you. 
This news really encouraged us while we were suffering troubles ourselves, brothers and sisters, knowing that you continue to hold on to your trust in God. 
For us life is worth living now because you're standing firm in the Lord! 
As we go into the presence of our God, how can we ever thank God enough for you because of all the joy you bring to us? 
Night and day we pray for you as earnestly as possible, hoping to see you again face to face, and to help you continue developing your trust in God. 
May God our Father and our Lord Jesus make it possible for us to come to see you soon. 
May the Lord increase your love so it overflows to one another, and to everyone, just as we love you. 
In this way may the Lord strengthen you so you may stand with minds that are holy and blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.
