Chapter 140.
For the music director. A psalm of David. Lord, please save me from those who do evil; protect me especially from those who are violent! 
Their minds are busy plotting evil things, stirring up trouble all day long. 
Their tongues are as sharp as those of snakes; viper's venom is on their lips. Selah. 
Lord, please keep me from falling into the hands of the wicked; protect me especially from those who are violent, who are plotting my downfall. 
Proud people have hidden a trap for me—they have strung out a net on the path, they have set snares to catch me. Selah. 
I told the Lord, “You are my God! Lord, please listen to my cries for help!” 
Lord God, my powerful Savior, you covered my head like a helmet on the day of battle. 
God, don't allow the wicked to get what they want—don't let them be successful in what they plan so they don't become proud. Selah. 
May the harm spoken against me by those who surround me fall back on them, 
Let burning coals rain down on them! Let them be thrown into the fire, or into bottomless pits, never to rise again. 
Don't let people who slander others live in our land. May disaster strike down violent people. 
Yet I know the Lord defends the rights of those who are persecuted, and gives justice to the poor. 
Truly those who live right are thankful for the kind of person you are, and those who are honest will live in your presence.
