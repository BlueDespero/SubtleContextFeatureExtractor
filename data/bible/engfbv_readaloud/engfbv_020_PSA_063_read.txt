PSALMS.
Chapter 63.
A psalm of David, when he was in the Judean desert. God, you are my God, I eagerly look for you. I am thirsty for you; all that I am longs for you in this dry, weary, waterless land. 
I see you in the Temple; I watch your power and glory. 
Your trustworthy love is better than life itself; I will praise you. 
I will thank you as long as I live; I lift up my hands as I celebrate your wonderful character. 
You satisfy me more than the richest food; I will praise you with joyful songs. 
I think of you all night long as I lie on my bed meditating about you. 
For you are the one who helps me; I sing happily from under your wings. 
I hold on to you; your strong arms lift me up. 
Those who are trying to destroy me will go down into the grave. 
They will be killed by the sword; they will become food for jackals. 
But the king will be happy for what God has done. All who follow God will praise him, but those who tell lies will be silenced.
