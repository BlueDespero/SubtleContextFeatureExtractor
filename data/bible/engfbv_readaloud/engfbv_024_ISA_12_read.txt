Isaiah.
Chapter 12.
At that time you will say, “I will praise you, Lord! Though you were angry with me, your anger is over, and now you comfort me. 
Look! God is my salvation! I will trust in him and I won't be afraid! For the Lord is my strength and song, and he has saved me!” 
With great happiness you will take water from the well of salvation. 
At that time you will say: “Praise the Lord, shout out his name! Tell the nations what he has done—let them know of his wonderful character! 
Sing to the Lord for all the glorious things he's done—let the whole world know! 
Shout loudly and sing for joy, you people of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel is great, and is among you.”
