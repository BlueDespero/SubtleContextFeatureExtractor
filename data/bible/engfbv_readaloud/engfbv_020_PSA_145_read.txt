Chapter 145.
A psalm of David. A song of praise. I will glorify you, my God and King! I will praise who you are forever and ever! 
I will praise you every day; I will praise your character forever and ever! 
The Lord is great and deserves much praise! His greatness cannot be measured! 
Let every generation tell the next all that you do, sharing the stories of your amazing miracles! 
They will speak of your majesty, your glorious splendor, and I will meditate on the wonderful things you have done. 
They will speak of the power of your awesome actions, and I will say how wonderful you are. 
They will explain to everyone how famous you are for your tremendous goodness, and joyfully celebrate how you always do what is right. 
The Lord is merciful and gracious, not easily angered, and full of trustworthy love. 
The Lord is good to everyone, and he shows mercy to all his created beings. 
All the created beings will thank you, Lord, and all who faithfully follow you will praise you. 
They will praise the glory of your kingdom, and talk about your power. 
They will explain to people your wonderful miracles, and the glorious splendor of your kingdom. 
Your kingdom never ends, and your rule continues for all generations. What the Lord promises can always be trusted; he is merciful in all he does. 
The Lord helps up all those who fall down; he lifts up all those who are bowed down. 
All eyes are on you, waiting in hope, and you give food at just the right time. 
You give generously and satisfy the needs of every living thing. 
The Lord does right in everything—his actions are always trustworthy. 
The Lord is close to all who ask for his help, to all who ask in sincerity. 
He satisfies the needs of those who follow him. He hears their cries for help and he saves them. 
The Lord takes care of all those who love him, but he will destroy all those who are wicked. 
I will speak in praise of the Lord, and may everyone honor his holy character, forever and ever.
