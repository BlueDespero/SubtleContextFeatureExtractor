Chapter 147.
Praise the Lord, for it's good to sing praises to our God! Praise is wonderful and beautiful! 
The Lord is rebuilding Jerusalem, gathering together the people of Israel who have been scattered. 
He heals the broken-hearted, and bandages the wounded. 
He knows how many stars he made, and commands all of them by name. 
Our Lord is great! His power is immense! There's no limit to what he understands! 
The Lord helps those who are bowed down to get up; but he grinds the wicked into the ground. 
Sing thanks to the Lord! Sing praises to our God with a harp! 
He covers the sky with clouds to bring rain to the earth, and makes the grass grow on the hills. 
He gives food to the animals, and to the baby ravens when they call. 
The Lord doesn't appreciate the strength of war-horses or value human power. 
What the Lord values are those who follow him, those who put their confidence in his trustworthy love. 
Jerusalem, praise the Lord! Zion, praise your God! 
He makes the bars on your city gates strong, and blesses your children around you. 
He keeps the borders of your land safe from attack; he provides you with plenty of the finest wheat. 
He sends his commands around the world—they're quickly implemented. 
He sends snow as white as wool, and scatters frost like ashes. 
He throws hail like stones. Who can stand the cold he sends? 
Then he sends out his command and it melts; he blows on it and the water flows. 
He proclaims his word to Jacob; his rules and laws to Israel. 
He has not done this for any other nation—they don't know his laws. Praise the Lord!
