Chapter 41.
For the music director. A psalm of David. How happy are those who take care of the poor! When they are in trouble the Lord will save them. 
The Lord protects them and keeps them alive. They will live happily in the land, and they will not be handed over to their enemies. 
The Lord looks after them when they're sick; he makes them well from their illness. 
“Lord, please be gracious to me,” I asked. “Please heal me, for I have sinned against you.” 
Those who hate me only say evil things about me. “When is he going to die, and people forget all about him?” they ask. 
They come to visit me, but their sympathy is not sincere. They're only interested in the bad news, which they spread around as soon as they leave. 
All who hate me talk in whispers about my condition, hoping for the worst. 
“He's been cursed with some terrible disease,” they say. “Now he's bed-ridden he'll never recover!” 
Even my best friend, the one I trusted, who shared meals with me—even he has turned against me. 
But you Lord, please be gracious to me, make me well so I can repay them! 
I know you are pleased with me because you have not let my enemies win and shout in triumph over me. 
You have supported me because of my integrity, you have brought me into your presence forever. 
Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity! Amen and amen!
