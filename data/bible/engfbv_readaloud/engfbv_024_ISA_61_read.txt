Isaiah.
Chapter 61.
The Spirit of the Lord God is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to announce liberation to the captives, to set the prisoners free, 
to declare the year of the Lord's grace and the day of our God's punishment, to comfort those who mourn. 
The Lord will give to everyone who mourns in Zion a crown instead of ashes on their head, the oil of happiness instead of mourning, clothes of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of integrity, planted by the Lord to reveal his glory. 
They will rebuild the old ruins; they will restore places abandoned long ago; they will restore towns that were destroyed, places left desolate for generation after generation. 
Foreigners will shepherd your flocks, and take care of your fields, and look after your vineyards. 
You will be called priests of the Lord, identified as ministers of our God. You will enjoy the wealth of nations and be proud that you have it. 
Instead of shame you will receive a double blessing; instead of insults, you will be happy to have a double amount of land given to you, and your joy will last forever. 
I, the Lord, love what is right. I hate robbery and injustice. I will faithfully reward my people and make an everlasting agreement with them. 
Their descendants will be acknowledged among the nations, and their children among the peoples. Everyone who sees them will agree that they are people that the Lord has blessed. 
I will happily celebrate in the Lord! My whole being will shout praises to my God. For he has dressed me with the clothing of salvation, and has wrapped around me in a robe of goodness. I am like a bridegroom dressed for the wedding, like a bride wearing her jewels. 
Just as the earth sends up shoots, and plants grow in a garden, so the Lord makes goodness and praise grow before all nations.
