Chapter 39.
For Jeduthun, the music director. A psalm of David. I told myself, “I will be careful in what I do, and not sin in what I say. I will keep my mouth shut when the wicked are around.” 
So I was completely silent—I didn't even say anything good. But the pain inside only got worse. 
My mind burned as if on fire; I had to say what I was thinking: 
Lord, remind me. How short is my life? How long do I have? Remind me how quickly my life will pass. 
Just look at the tiny amount of days you have given me! In your eyes my whole lifetime is like nothing. Our lives here are just a breath… Selah. 
Human beings are just shadows walking around. They pointlessly rush through life, trying to pile up possessions without knowing who will get them. 
So Lord, what am I looking for? I put my hope in you. 
Save me from my rebellion. Don't let me be mocked by fools. 
I will stay quiet, I won't say a word, for it's you who has done this to me. 
Please stop hitting me! Your beating has worn me out! 
When you discipline us, reprimanding us for our sins, it's like a moth eating up what is precious to us. All of us are just a breath… Selah. 
Please hear my prayer, Lord! Listen to my cry for help! Don't be deaf to my weeping. Please treat me as your guest, passing through, just like my forefathers. 
Please leave me alone so I can be cheerful again, before I am dead and gone.
