Chapter 20.
For the music director. A psalm of David. May the Lord answer you when you are in trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you. 
May the Lord send you help from the sanctuary, and may he support you from Zion. 
May the Lord remember all your offerings, and accept all your burnt sacrifices. Selah. 
May the Lord give you whatever you really want; may he make all your plans successful. 
May we shout for joy over your victory, and set up banners in the name of our God. May the Lord answer all your requests. 
Now I know that the Lord saves the one he has anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, and save his anointed by his powerful right hand. 
Some trust in chariots and some in war horses, but we trust in who the Lord our God is. 
They collapse and fall down, but we rise and stand up. 
May the Lord save the king! Please answer us when we call for help!
