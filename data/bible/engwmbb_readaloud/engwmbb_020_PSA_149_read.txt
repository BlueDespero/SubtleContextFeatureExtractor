Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the holy ones. 
Let Israel rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp! 
For the LORD takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with salvation yeshu`ah. 
Let the holy ones rejoice in honour. Let them sing for joy on their beds. 
May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand, 
to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples; 
to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
to execute on them the written judgement. All his holy ones have this honour. Praise the LORD!
