1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men 
—on behalf of kings and all who are in authority, that we may live a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 
Because this is good and pleasing to our Savior God, 
who desires all men to be saved and to come into a real knowledge of Truth. 
For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men—a man!—Jesus Christ, 
who gave Himself as a ransom on behalf of all people (to be testified in its own seasons), 
to which ransom I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying—a teacher of nations in faith and truth. 
So I desire that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument. 
Similarly the women also, dressing themselves in appropriate clothing, with modesty and good sense; not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
but with good works, which is appropriate to women who profess godliness. 
Let a woman learn in silence, in full subordination. 
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. 
For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
Also, Adam was not deceived; rather, the woman, being deceived, became a transgressor. 
However, she will be saved through the Childbirth—if they continue in faith, love and holiness, with self-control.
