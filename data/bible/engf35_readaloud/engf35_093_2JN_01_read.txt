The Second Epistle of John.
Chapter 1.
The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I only, but also all who have known the Truth— 
because of the Truth, who abides in us and will be with us into the age: 
Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with you in truth and love. 
It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we received commandment from the Father. 
And now I put a request to you, lady (not as though writing a new commandment to you, but one that we have from the beginning): that we love one another. 
And this is the love, that we live according to His commandments—this is the commandment, just as you heard from the beginning, that you should live according to it. 
Now many deceivers have come into the world, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in flesh—this is the deceiver, even the Antichrist! 
Look to yourselves, so that we not lose the things for which we worked but may receive a full reward. 
Anyone who turns aside and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; but whoever continues in Christ's teaching does have both the Father and the Son. 
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house; do not even tell him, “I wish you well,” 
because whoever tells him, “I wish you well,” participates in his malignant works. 
Although I had many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; instead I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete. 
The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
