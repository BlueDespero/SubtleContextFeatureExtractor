1 Peter.
Chapter 5.
The elders who are among you I exhort, I, the fellow elder and witness of Christ's sufferings; also the partaker of the glory that is to be revealed: 
Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers willingly, not under compulsion; not for dishonest gain but freely; 
neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 
And when the Chief Shepherd is revealed you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 
Similarly, you younger ones, submit to elders. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility, submitting to one another, because ‘God resists proud ones, but gives grace to humble ones.’ 
Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time; 
casting all your care upon Him, because He does the caring for you. 
Be sober, stay alert! Because your enemy the devil, like a roaring lion, is circling you, looking for someone to devour; 
withstand him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. 
Now may the God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, Himself perfect, establish, strengthen and ground you—after you have suffered a while. 
To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen. 
I have written to you briefly by our faithful brother Silvanus, as I consider him, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. 
The jointly elect sister in ‘Babylon’ greets you; and so does Mark, my son. 
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you, all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
