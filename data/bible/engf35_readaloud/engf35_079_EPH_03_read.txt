Ephesians.
Chapter 3.
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 
surely you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me for you, 
how that by revelation He made known to me the ‘secret’ (as I have written briefly already, 
with reference to which, when you read, you can understand my insight into Christ's secret), 
which in different generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: 
that the Gentiles are joint-heirs, of the same body, and fellow partakers of His promise in the Christ through the Gospel, 
of which I became a servant according to the gift of God's grace, the gift given to me according to the outworking of His power. 
To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 
and to enlighten all as to the program of the secret that from the beginning of the ages has been hidden by the God who created all things through Jesus Christ; 
to the intent that now, through the Church, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms, 
according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished by Christ Jesus our Lord, 
in whom we have the boldness and the access with confidence through faith in Him. 
Therefore I ask that you not lose heart at my afflictions on your behalf, which is your glory. 
For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name, 
that HeF may grant you, according to the riches of His glory: 1) to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man; 
2) Christ to dwell in your hearts through the Faith, having been rooted and established in love 
so that you may be fully able to grasp (with all saints) what is the breadth and length and depth and height; 
and 3) to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge—so that you may be fulfilled into all the fullness of God. 
Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to the power that is working in us, 
to Him be the glory in the Church in Christ Jesus, to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
