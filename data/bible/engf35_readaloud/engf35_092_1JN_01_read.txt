The First Epistle of John.
Chapter 1.
That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have witnessed with our eyes, that which we contemplated and our hands handled with reference to the word of the Life 
—oh yes, the Life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and declare to you that eternal Life who was in the presence of the Father and was manifested to us— 
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, so that you also may have fellowship with us; indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. 
Yes, we write these things to you so that our joy may be fulfilled. 
Now this is the message that we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and there is no darkness at all in Him. 
If we claim that we have fellowship with Him while walking in the darkness, we are lying and not living the truth. 
But if we walk in the light just as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. 
If we claim that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the Truth is not in us. 
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us those sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
If we claim that we have not sinned, we call Him a liar and His Word is not in us.
