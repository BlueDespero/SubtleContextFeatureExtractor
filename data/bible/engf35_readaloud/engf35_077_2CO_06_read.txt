2 Corinthians.
Chapter 6.
So working together we really urge you not to receive God's grace in vain, 
for He says: “At a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I aided you.” Well, right now is a really favorable time; indeed, the day of salvation is now! 
(We give no occasion for offense in anything, that the ministry not be faulted; 
rather we commend ourselves as God's servants in every way with great endurance—in afflictions, in hardships, in distress, 
in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in hard work, in sleepless nights, in fastings; 
by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, 
by truthful speech, by God's power, with the weapons of the righteousness in the right hand and in the left; 
through glory and dishonor, through defamation and good repute; as ‘deceivers’ and true, 
as unknown and well known, as dying and we live on, as chastened and not killed; 
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing everything!) 
O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is open wide. 
You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your affections. 
Now in return for the same (I speak as to my children), you also be wide open. 
Do not enter a mismatch with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness have in common? And what fellowship does light have with darkness? 
And what agreement is there between Christ and Belial? Or what portion can a believer share with an unbeliever? 
Further, what agreement can a temple of God have with idols? Because you are a temple of the living God, just as God said: “I will dwell in them and walk among them; I will be their God and they will by my people.” 
Therefore, “Come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord, “Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.” 
And, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.”
