The Third Epistle of John.
Chapter 1.
The elder, to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. 
Dear one, I pray for you to prosper in every way and to be healthy, just as your soul prospers. 
Because it gave me great joy when some brothers came and testified to the truth about you, how you are walking in Truth. 
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in Truth. 
Dear one, you are faithful in whatever you do for the brothers, and for the strangers 
who testified to your love before the church—you will do well by sending them on their way in a manner worthy of God, 
because it was for the sake of the Name that they went out, accepting nothing from pagans. 
We therefore ought to welcome such, so that we may work together for the Truth. 
I wrote to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who wants to dominate the others, does not acknowledge us. 
So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, slandering us with malignant words. And not satisfied with that, not only does he himself not receive the brothers, but he forbids those who want to do so, kicking them out of the congregation. 
Dear one, do not imitate what is bad, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. 
Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—even by the truth itself. Yes, we also speak well of him, and we know that our testimony is true. 
I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; 
rather I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here greet you. Greet the friends there by name.
