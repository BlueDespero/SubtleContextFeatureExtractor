Psalms.
Chapter 110.
Alleluia. I will give thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
The works of the Lord are great, Sought out according to all his will. 
His work is worthy of thanksgiving and honor: And his righteousness endures forever and ever. 
He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered: The Lord is merciful and compassionate. 
He has given food to them that fear him: He will remember his covenant forever. 
He has declared to his people the power of his works, To give them the inheritance of the heathen. 
The works of his hands are truth and judgment: All his commandments are sure: 
Established forever and ever, Done in truth and uprightness. 
He sent redemption to his people: He commanded his covenant forever: Holy and fearful is his name. 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, And all that act accordingly have a good understanding; His praise endures forever and ever.
