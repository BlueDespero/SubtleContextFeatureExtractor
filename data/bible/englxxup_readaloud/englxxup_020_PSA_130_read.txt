Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A Song of Degrees. O Lord, my heart is not exalted, Neither have mine eyes been haughtily raised: Neither have I exercised myself in great matters, Nor in things too wonderful for me. 
I shall have sinned if I have not been humble, But have exalted my soul: According to the relation of a weaned child to his mother, So wilt thou recompense my soul. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord, From henceforth and forever.
