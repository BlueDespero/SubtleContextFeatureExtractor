Isaiah.
Chapter 20.
In the year when Tanathan came to Ashdod, when he was sent by Sargon king of the Assyrians, and warred against Ashdod, and took it; 
then the Lord spoke to Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off thy loins, and loose thy sandals from off thy feet, and do thus, going naked and barefoot. 
And the Lord said, As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years, there shall be three years for signs and wonders to the Egyptians and Ethiopians; 
for thus shall the king of the Assyrians lead the captivity of Egypt and the Ethiopians, young men and old, naked and barefoot, having the shame of Egypt exposed. 
And the Egyptians being defeated shall be ashamed of the Ethiopians, in whom they had trusted; for they were their glory. 
And they that dwell in this island shall say in that day, Behold, we trusted to flee to them for help, who could not save themselves from the king of the Assyrians: and how shall we be saved?
