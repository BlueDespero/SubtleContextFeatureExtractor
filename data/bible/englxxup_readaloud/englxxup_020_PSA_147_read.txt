Psalms.
Chapter 147.
Alleluia, a Psalm of Haggai and Zechariah. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; Praise thy God, O Zion. 
For he has strengthened the bars of thy gates; He has blessed thy children within thee. 
He makes thy borders peaceful, And fills thee with the flour of wheat. 
He sends his oracle to the earth: His word will run swiftly. 
He gives snow like wool: He scatters the mist like ashes. 
Casting forth his ice like morsels: Who shall stand before his cold? 
He shall send out his word, and melt them: He shall blow with his wind, and the waters shall flow. 
He sends his word to Jacob, His ordinances and judgments to Israel. 
He has not done so to any other nation; And he has not shown them his judgments.
