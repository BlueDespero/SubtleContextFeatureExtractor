Psalms.
Chapter 122.
A Song of Degrees. Unto thee who dwellest in heaven Have I lifted up mine eyes. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed to the hands of their masters, And as the eyes of a maidservant to the hands of her mistress; So our eyes are directed to the Lord our God, Until he have mercy upon us. 
Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
Yea, our soul has been exceedingly filled with it: Let the reproach be to them that are at ease, And contempt to the proud.
