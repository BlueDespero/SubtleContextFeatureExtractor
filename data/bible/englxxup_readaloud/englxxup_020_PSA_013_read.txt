Psalms.
Chapter 13.
For the end, a Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted themselves, and become abominable in their devices; There is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one. 
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, To see if there were any that understood, or sought after God. 
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, There is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulcher; With their tongues they have used deceit; The poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; Their feet are swift to shed blood: Destruction and misery are in their ways; And the way of peace they have not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
Will not all the workers of iniquity know, Who eat up my people as they would eat bread? They have not called upon the Lord. 
There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; For God is in the righteous generation. 
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, Because the Lord is his hope. 
Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, Let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad.
