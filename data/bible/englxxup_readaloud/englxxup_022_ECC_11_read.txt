Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 11.
Send forth thy bread upon the face of the water: For thou shalt find it after many days. 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; For thou knowest not what evil there shall be upon the earth. 
If the clouds be filled with rain, They pour it out upon the earth: And if a tree fall southward, or if it fall northward, In the place where the tree shall fall, there it shall be. 
He that observes the wind sows not; And he that looks at the clouds will not reap. 
Among whom none knows what is the way of the wind: As the bones are hidden in the womb of a pregnant woman, So thou shalt not know the works of God, Even all things whatsoever he shall do. 
In the morning sow thy seed, And in the evening let not thy hand be slack: For thou knowest not what sort shall prosper, whether this or that, Or whether both shall be good alike. 
Moreover the light is sweet, And it is good for the eyes to see the sun. 
For even if a man should live many years, And rejoice in them all; Yet let him remember the days of darkness; For they shall be many. All that comes is vanity. 
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; And let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, And walk in the ways of thy heart blameless, But not in the sight of thine eyes: Yet know that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, And put away evil from thy flesh: For youth and folly are vanity.
