Psalms.
Chapter 50.
For the end, a Psalm of David, 
when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to Bathsheba. 
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great mercy; And according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression. 
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. 
For I am conscious of mine iniquity; And my sin is continually before me. 
Against thee only have I sinned, And done evil before thee: That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, And mightest overcome when thou art judged. 
For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, And in sins did my mother conceive me. 
For, behold, thou lovest truth: Thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom. 
Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be purified: Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
Thou shalt cause me to hear gladness and joy: The afflicted bones shall rejoice. 
Turn away thy face from my sins, And blot out all mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit in my inward parts. 
Cast me not away from thy presence; And remove not thy holy Spirit from me. 
Restore to me the joy of thy salvation: Establish me with thy directing Spirit. 
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; And ungodly men shall turn to thee. 
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: And my tongue shall joyfully declare thy righteousness. 
O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; And my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given it: Thou wilt not take pleasure in whole burnt offerings. 
Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: A broken and humbled heart God will not despise. 
Do good, O Lord, to Zion in thy good pleasure; And let the walls of Jerusalem be built. 
Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, Offering, and whole burnt sacrifices: Then shall they offer calves upon thine altar.
