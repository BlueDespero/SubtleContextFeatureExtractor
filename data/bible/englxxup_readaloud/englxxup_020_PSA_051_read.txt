Psalms.
Chapter 51.
For the end, a Psalm of instruction by David, 
when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David is gone to the house of Ahimelech. 
Why dost thou, O mighty man, boast of iniquity in thy mischief? All the day 
thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; Like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit. 
Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; Unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. Pause. 
Thou hast loved all words of destruction, And a deceitful tongue. 
Therefore may God destroy thee forever, May he pluck thee up and utterly remove thee from thy dwelling, And thy root from the land of the living. Pause. 
And the righteous shall see, and fear, And shall laugh at him, and say, 
Behold the man who made not God his help; But trusted in the abundance of his wealth, And strengthened himself in his vanity. 
But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God Forever, even for evermore. 
I will give thanks to thee forever, for thou hast done it: And I will wait on thy name; For it is good before thy saints.
