Psalms.
Chapter 19.
For the end, a Psalm of David. 
The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob defend thee. 
Send thee help from the sanctuary, And aid thee out of Zion. 
Remember all thy sacrifice, And enrich thy whole burnt offering. Pause. 
Grant thee according to thy heart, And fulfill all thy desire. 
We will exult in thy salvation, And in the name of our God shall we be magnified: The Lord fulfill all thy petitions. 
Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ: He shall hear him from his holy heaven: The salvation of his right hand is mighty. 
Some glory in chariots, and some in horses: But we will glory in the name of the Lord our God. 
They are overthrown and fallen: But we are risen, and have been set upright. 
O Lord, save the king: And hear us in whatever day we call upon thee.
