Psalms.
Chapter 81.
A Psalm for Asaph. God stands in the assembly of gods; And in the midst of them will judge gods. 
How long will ye judge unrighteously, And accept the persons of sinners? Pause. 
Judge the orphan and poor: Do justice to the low and needy. 
Rescue the needy, and deliver the poor Out of the hand of the sinner. 
They know not, nor understand; They walk on in darkness: All the foundations of the earth shall be shaken. 
I have said, Ye are gods; And all of you children of the Most High. 
But ye die as men, And fall as one of the princes. 
Arise, O God, judge the earth: For thou shalt inherit all nations.
