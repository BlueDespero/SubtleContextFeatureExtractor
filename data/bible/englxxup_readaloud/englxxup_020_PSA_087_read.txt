Psalms.
Chapter 87.
A song of a Psalm for the sons of Korah for the end, upon Mahalath for responsive strains, of instruction for Heman the Israelite. 
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried by day and in the night before thee. 
Let my prayer come in before thee; Incline thine ear to my supplication, O Lord. 
For my soul is filled with troubles, And my life has drawn nigh to Hades. 
I have been reckoned with them that go down to the pit; I became as a man without help; 
free among the dead, As the slain ones cast out, who sleep in the tomb; Whom thou rememberest no more; And they are rejected from thy hand. 
They laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, and in the shadow of death. 
Thy wrath has pressed heavily upon me, And thou hast brought upon me all thy billows. Pause. 
Thou hast removed my acquaintance far from me; They have made me an abomination to themselves; I have been delivered up, and have not gone forth. 
Mine eyes are dimmed from poverty; But I cried to thee, O Lord, all the day; I spread forth my hands to thee. 
Wilt thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall physicians raise them up, that they shall praise thee? 
Shall anyone declare thy mercy in the tomb? And thy truth in destruction? 
Shall thy wonders be known in darkness? And thy righteousness in a forgotten land? 
But I cried to thee, O Lord; And in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. 
Wherefore, O Lord, dost thou reject my prayer, And turn thy face away from me? 
I am poor and in troubles from my youth; And having been exalted, I was brought low and into despair. 
Thy wrath has passed over me; And thy terrors have greatly disquieted me. 
They compassed me like water; All the day they beset me together. 
Thou hast put far from me every friend, And mine acquaintances because of my wretchedness.
