Psalms.
Chapter 12.
For the end, a Psalm of David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me? forever? How long wilt thou turn away thy face from me? 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrows in my heart daily? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
Look on me, hearken to me, O Lord my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
Lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: My persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. 
But I have hoped in thy mercy; My heart shall exult in thy salvation. 
I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, And I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high.
