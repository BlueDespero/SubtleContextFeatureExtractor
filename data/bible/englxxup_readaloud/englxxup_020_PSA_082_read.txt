Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A Song of a Psalm for Asaph. 
O God, who shall be compared to thee? Be not silent, neither be still, O God. 
For behold, thine enemies have made a noise; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 
Against thy people they have craftily imagined a device, And have taken counsel against thy saints. 
They have said, Come, and let us utterly destroy them out of the nation; And let the name of Israel be remembered no more at all. 
For they have taken counsel together with one consent: They have made a confederacy against thee; 
Even the tents of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites; 
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; The Philistines also, with them that dwell at Tyre. 
Yea, Asshur too is come with them: They have become a help to the children of Lot. Pause. 
Do thou to them as to Midian, and to Sisera; As to Jabin at the brook of Kishon. 
They were utterly destroyed at En-dor: They became as dung for the earth. 
Make their princes as Oreb and Zeeb, And Zebah and Zalmunna; even all their princes: 
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the altar of God as an inheritance. 
O my God, make them as a wheel; As stubble before the face of the wind. 
As fire which shall burn up a wood, As the flame may consume the mountains; 
So shalt thou persecute them with thy tempest, And trouble them in thine anger. 
Fill their faces with dishonor; So shall they seek thy name, O Lord. 
Let them be ashamed and troubled for evermore; Yea, let them be confounded and destroyed. 
And let them know that thy name is Lord; That thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
