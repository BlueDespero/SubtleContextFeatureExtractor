Psalms.
Chapter 61.
For the end, a Psalm of David for Jeduthun. 
Shall not my soul be subjected to God? For of him is my salvation. 
For he is my God and my Savior; My helper, I shall not be moved very much. 
How long will ye assault a man? Ye are all slaughtering As with a bowed wall and a broken hedge. 
They only took counsel to set at nought mine honor: I ran in thirst: With their mouth they blessed, but with their heart they cursed. Pause. 
Nevertheless do thou, my soul, be subjected to God; For of him is my patient hope. 
For he is my God and my Savior; My helper, I shall not be moved. 
In God is my salvation and my glory: He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God. 
Hope in him, all ye congregation of the people; Pour out your hearts before him, for God is our helper. Pause. 
But the sons of men are vain; The sons of men are false, so as to be deceitful in the balances; They are all alike formed out of vanity. 
Trust not in unrighteousness, And lust not after robberies: If wealth should flow in, set not your heart upon it. 
God has spoken once, and I have heard these two things, That power is of God; 
and mercy is thine, O Lord; For thou wilt recompense every one according to his works.
