Psalms.
Chapter 119.
A Song of Degrees. In mine affliction I cried to the Lord, And he hearkened to me. 
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips, And from a deceitful tongue. 
What should be given to thee, and what should be added to thee, For thy crafty tongue? 
Sharpened weapons of the mighty, With coals of the desert. 
Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged; I have tabernacled among the tents of Kedar. 
My soul has long been a sojourner; 
I was peaceable among them that hated peace; When I spoke to them, they warred against me without a cause.
