Jonah.
Chapter 4.
But Jonah was very deeply grieved, and he was confounded. 
And he prayed to the Lord, and said, O Lord, were not these my words when I was yet in my land? therefore I made haste to flee to Tarshish; because I knew that thou art merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and repentest of evil. 
And now, Lord God, take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. 
And the Lord said to Jonah, Art thou very much grieved? 
And Jonah went out from the city, and sat over against the city; and he made for himself there a booth, and he sat under it, until he should perceive what would become of the city. 
And the Lord God commanded a gourd, and it came up over the head of Jonah, to be a shadow over his head, to shade him from his calamities: and Jonah rejoiced with great joy for the gourd. 
And God commanded a worm the next morning, and it smote the gourd, and it withered away. 
And it came to pass at the rising of the sun, that God commanded a burning east wind; and the sun smote on the head of Jonah, and he fainted, and despaired of his life, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. 
And God said to Jonah, Art thou very much grieved for the gourd? And he said, I am very much grieved, even to death. 
And the Lord said, Thou hadst pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not suffered, neither didst thou rear it; which came up before night, and perished before another night: 
and shall not I spare Nineveh, the great city, in which dwell more than twelve myriads of human beings, who do not know their right hand or their left hand; and also much cattle?
