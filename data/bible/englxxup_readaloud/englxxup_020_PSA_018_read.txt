Psalms.
Chapter 18.
For the end, a Psalm of David. 
The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. 
Day to day utters speech, And night to night proclaims knowledge. 
There are no speeches or words, In which their voices are not heard. 
Their voice is gone out into all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world. 
In the sun he has set his tabernacle; And he comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber: He will exult as a giant to run his course. 
His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, And his circuit to the other end of heaven: And no one shall be hidden from his heat. 
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting souls: The testimony of the Lord is faithful, instructing babes. 
The ordinances of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of the Lord is bright, enlightening the eyes. 
The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever and ever: The judgments of the Lord are true, and justified altogether. 
To be desired more than gold, and much precious stone: Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 
For thy servant keeps to them: In the keeping of them there is great reward. 
Who will understand his transgressions? Purge thou me from my secret sins. 
And spare thy servant the attack of strangers: If they do not gain the dominion over me, then shall I be blameless, And I shall be clear from great sin. 
So shall the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be pleasing continually before thee, O Lord my helper, and my redeemer.
