Psalms.
Chapter 46.
For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
Clap your hands, all ye nations; Shout to God with a voice of exultation. 
For the Lord most high is terrible; He is a great king over all the earth. 
He has subdued the peoples under us, And the nations under our feet. 
He has chosen out his inheritance for us, The beauty of Jacob which he loved. Pause. 
God is gone up with a shout, The Lord with a sound of a trumpet. 
Sing praises to our God, sing praises: Sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
For God is king of all the earth: Sing praises with understanding. 
God reigns over the nations: God sits upon the throne of his holiness. 
The rulers of the people are assembled with the God of Abraham: For God’s mighty ones of the earth have been greatly exalted.
