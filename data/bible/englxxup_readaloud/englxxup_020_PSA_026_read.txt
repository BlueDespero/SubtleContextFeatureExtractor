Psalms.
Chapter 26.
A Psalm of David, before he was anointed. The Lord is my light and my Savior; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
When evildoers drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh, My persecutors and mine enemies, they fainted and fell. 
Though an army should set itself in array against me, my heart shall not be afraid: Though war should rise up against me, in this am I confident. 
One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: That I should dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, That I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, And survey his temple. 
For in the day of mine afflictions he hid me in his tabernacle: He sheltered me in the secret of his tabernacle; He set me up on a rock. 
And now, behold, he has lifted up my head over mine enemies: I went round and offered in his tabernacle the sacrifice of joy; I will sing, even sing psalms to the Lord. 
Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have uttered aloud: Pity me, and hearken to me. 
My heart said to thee, I have diligently sought thy face: Thy face, O Lord, I will seek. 
Turn not thy face away from me, Turn not thou away from thy servant in anger: Be thou my helper, forsake me not; And, O God my Savior, overlook me not. 
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, But the Lord has taken me to himself. 
Teach me, O Lord, in thy way, And guide me in a right path, because of mine enemies. 
Deliver me not over to the desire of them that afflict me; For unjust witnesses have risen up against me, And injustice has lied within herself. 
I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. 
Wait on the Lord: Be of good courage, and let thy heart be strengthened: Yea, wait on the Lord.
