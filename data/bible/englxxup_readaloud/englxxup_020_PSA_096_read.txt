Psalms.
Chapter 96.
For David, when his land is established. The Lord reigns, let the earth exult, Let many islands rejoice. 
Cloud and darkness are round about him; Righteousness and judgment are the establishment of his throne. 
Fire shall go before him, And burn up his enemies round about. 
His lightnings appeared to the world; The earth saw, and trembled. 
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
The heavens have declared his righteousness, And all the people have seen his glory. 
Let all that worship graven images be ashamed, Who boast of their idols; Worship him, all ye his angels. 
Zion heard and rejoiced; And the daughters of Judea exulted, Because of thy judgments, O Lord. 
For thou art Lord most high over all the earth; Thou art greatly exalted above all gods. 
Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; The Lord preserves the souls of his saints; He shall deliver them from the hand of sinners. 
Light is sprung up for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart. 
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; And give thanks for a remembrance of his holiness.
