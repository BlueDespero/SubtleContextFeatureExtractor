Psalms.
Chapter 3.
A Psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of his son Absalom. 
O Lord, why are they that afflict me multiplied? Many rise up against me. 
Many say concerning my soul, There is no deliverance for him in his God. Pause. 
But thou, O Lord, art my helper: My glory, and the one that lifts up my head. 
I cried to the Lord with my voice, And he heard me out of his holy mountain. Pause. 
I lay down and slept; I awoke; for the Lord will help me. 
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, Who beset me round about. 
Arise, Lord; deliver me, my God: For thou hast smitten all who were without cause mine enemies; Thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. 
Deliverance is the Lord’s, And thy blessing is upon thy people.
