Kings III.
Chapter 14.
And Rehoboam son of Solomon ruled over Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in the city Jerusalem, which the Lord chose to put his name there out of all the tribes of Israel: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. 
And Rehoboam did evil in the sight of the Lord; and he provoked him in all the things which their fathers did in their sins which they sinned. 
And they built for themselves high places, and pillars, and planted groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree. 
And there was a conspiracy in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord removed from before the children of Israel. 
And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; 
and took all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king’s house, and the golden spears which David took out of the hand of the sons of Hadadezer king of Zobah, and brought them into Jerusalem, even all that he took, and the golden shields which Solomon had made, and carried them away into Egypt. 
And King Rehoboam made brazen shields instead of them; and the chiefs of the body guard, who kept the gate of the house of the king, were placed in charge over them. 
And it came to pass when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the body guard took them up, and fixed them in the chamber of the body guard. 
And the rest of the history of Rehoboam, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
