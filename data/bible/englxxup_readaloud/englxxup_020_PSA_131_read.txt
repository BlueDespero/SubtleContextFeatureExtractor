Psalms.
Chapter 131.
A Song of Degrees. Lord, remember David, And all his meekness: 
How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the God of Jacob, saying, 
I will not go into the tabernacle of my house; I will not go up to the couch of my bed; 
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Nor slumber to mine eyelids, Nor rest to my temples, 
Until I find a place for the Lord, A tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of the wood. 
Let us enter into his tabernacles: Let us worship at the place where his feet stood. 
Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; Thou, and the ark of thy holiness. 
Thy priests shall clothe themselves with righteousness; And thy saints shall exult. 
For the sake of thy servant David Turn not away the face of thine anointed. 
The Lord swore in truth to David, and he will not annul it, saying, Of the fruit of thy body will I set a king upon thy throne. 
If thy children will keep my covenant, And these my testimonies which I shall teach them, Their children also shall sit upon thy throne forever. 
For the Lord has elected Zion, He has chosen her for a habitation for himself, saying, 
This is my rest forever: Here will I dwell; for I have chosen it. 
I will surely bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
I will clothe her priests with salvation; And her saints shall greatly exult. 
There will I cause to spring up a horn to David: I have prepared a lamp for mine anointed. 
His enemies will I clothe with shame; But upon himself shall my holiness flourish.
