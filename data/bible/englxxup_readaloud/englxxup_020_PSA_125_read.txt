Psalms.
Chapter 125.
A Song of Degrees. When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, We became as comforted ones. 
Then was our mouth filled with joy, And our tongue with exultation: Then would they say among the Gentiles, 
The Lord has done great things among them. The Lord has done great things for us, We became joyful. 
Turn, O Lord, our captivity, As the streams in the south. 
They that sow in tears Shall reap in joy. 
They went on and wept As they cast their seeds; But they shall surely come with exultation, Bringing their sheaves with them.
