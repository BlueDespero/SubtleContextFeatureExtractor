Psalms.
Chapter 48.
For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
Hear these words, all ye nations, Hearken, all ye that dwell upon the earth: 
Both the sons of mean men, and sons of great men; The rich and poor man together. 
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall bring forth understanding. 
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my riddle on the harp. 
Wherefore should I fear in the evil day? The iniquity of my heel shall compass me. 
They that trust in their strength, And boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth— 
A brother does not redeem, shall a man redeem? He shall not give to God a ransom for himself, 
Or the price of the redemption of his soul, Though he labor forever, 
and live to the end, So that he should not see corruption. 
When he shall see wise men dying, The fool and the senseless one shall perish together; And they shall leave their wealth to strangers. 
And their sepulchers are their houses forever, Even their tabernacles to all generations: They have called their lands after their own names. 
And man being in honor, understands not: He is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like to them. 
This their way is an offense to them: Yet afterward men will commend their sayings. Pause. 
They have laid them as sheep in Hades; death shall feed on them; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, And their help shall fail in Hades from their glory. 
But God shall deliver my soul From the power of Hades, when he shall receive me. Pause. 
Fear not when a man is enriched, And when the glory of his house is increased. 
For he shall take nothing when he dies; Neither shall his glory descend with him. 
For his soul shall be blessed in his life: He shall give thanks to thee when thou dost well to him. 
Yet he shall go in to the generation of his fathers; He shall never see light. 
Man that is in honor, understands not: He is compared to the senseless cattle, and is like them.
