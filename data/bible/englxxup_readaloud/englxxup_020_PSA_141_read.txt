Psalms.
Chapter 141.
A Psalm of instruction for David, when he was in the cave—a Prayer. 
I cried to the Lord with my voice; With my voice I made supplication to the Lord. 
I will pour out before him my supplication: I will declare before him mine affliction. 
When my spirit was fainting within me, Then thou knewest my paths; In the very way wherein I was walking, they hid a snare for me. 
I looked on my right hand, and behold, For there was none that noticed me; Refuge failed me; And there was none that cared for my soul. 
I cried unto thee, O Lord, And said, Thou art my hope, My portion in the land of the living. 
Attend to my supplication, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from them that persecute me; For they are stronger than I. 
Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks to thy name, O Lord; The righteous shall wait for me, until thou recompense me.
