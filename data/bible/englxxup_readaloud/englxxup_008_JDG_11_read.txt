Judges.
Chapter 11.
And Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man; and he was the son of a harlot, who bore Jephthah to Gilead. 
And the wife of Gilead bore him sons; and the sons of his wife grew up, and they cast out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father, for thou art the son of a concubine. 
And Jephthah fled from the face of his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and vain men gathered to Jephthah, and went out with him. 
And it came to pass when the children of Ammon prepared to fight with Israel, 
that the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our head, and we will fight with the sons of Ammon. 
And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and cast me out of my father’s house, and banish me from you? and wherefore are ye come to me now when ye want me? 
And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore have we now turned to thee, that thou shouldest go with us, and fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 
And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye turn me back to fight with the children of Ammon, and the Lord should deliver them before me, then will I be your head. 
And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The Lord be witness between us, if we shall not do according to thy word. 
And Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and ruler over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah. 
And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have I to do with thee, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land? 
And the king of the children of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took my land when he went up out of Egypt, from Arnon to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now then return them peaceably and I will depart. 
And Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, 
and said to him, Thus says Jephthah, Israel took not the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon; 
for in their going up out of Egypt Israel went in the wilderness as far as the Sea of Siph, and came to Kadesh. 
And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I will pass, if it please thee, by thy land: and the king of Edom complied not: and Israel also sent to the king of Moab, and he did not consent; and Israel sojourned in Kadesh. 
And they journeyed in the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab: and they came by the east of the land of Moab, and encamped in the country beyond Arnon, and came not within the borders of Moab, for Arnon is the border of Moab. 
And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, by thy land to our place. 
And Sihon did not trust Israel to pass by his coast; and Sihon gathered all his people, and they encamped at Jahaz; and he set the battle in array against Israel. 
And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote him; and Israel inherited all the land of the Amorite who dwelt in that land, 
from Arnon and to Jabbok, and from the wilderness to Jordan. 
And now the Lord God of Israel has removed the Amorite from before his people Israel, and shalt thou inherit his land? 
Wilt thou not inherit those possessions which Chemosh thy god shall cause thee to inherit; and shall not we inherit the land of all those whom the Lord our God has removed from before you? 
And now art thou any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he indeed fight with Israel, or indeed make war with him, 
when Israel dwelt in Heshbon and in its coasts, and in the land of Aroer and in its coasts, and in all the cities by Jordan, three hundred years? and wherefore didst thou not recover them in that time? 
And now I have not sinned against thee, but thou wrongest me in preparing war against me: may the Lord the Judge judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. 
But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah, which he sent to him. 
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed by the watchtower of Gilead to the other side of the children of Ammon. 
And Jephthah vowed a vow to the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, 
then it shall come to pass that whosoever shall first come out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, he shall be the Lord’s: I will offer him up for a whole burnt offering. 
And Jephthah advanced to meet the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hand. 
And he smote them from Aroer till one comes to Arnon, in number twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a very great destruction: and the children of Ammon were straitened before the children of Israel. 
And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came forth to meet him with timbrels and dances; and she was his only child, he had not another son or daughter. 
And it came to pass when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Ah, ah, my daughter, thou hast indeed troubled me, and thou wast the cause of my trouble; and I have opened my mouth against thee to the Lord, and I shall not be able to return from it. 
And she said to him, Father, hast thou opened thy mouth to the Lord? Do to me accordingly as the word went out of thy mouth, in that the Lord has wrought vengeance for thee on thine enemies of the children of Ammon. 
And she said to her father, Let my father now do this thing: let me alone for two months, and I will go up and down on the mountains, and I will bewail my virginity, I and my companions. 
And he said, Go: and he sent her away for two months; and she went, and her companions, and she bewailed her virginity on the mountains. 
And it came to pass at the end of the two months that she returned to her father; and he performed upon her his vow which he vowed; and she knew no man: 
and it was an ordinance in Israel, That the daughters of Israel went from year to year to bewail the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days in a year.
