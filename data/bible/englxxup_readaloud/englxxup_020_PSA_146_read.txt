Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Alleluia, a Psalm of Haggai and Zechariah. Praise ye the Lord: for psalmody is a good thing; Let praise be sweetly sung to our God. 
The Lord builds up Jerusalem; And he will gather together the dispersed of Israel. 
He heals the broken in heart, And binds up their wounds. 
He numbers the multitudes of stars; And calls them all by names. 
Great is our Lord, and great is his strength; And his understanding is infinite. 
The Lord lifts up the meek; But brings sinners down to the ground. 
Begin the song with thanksgiving to the Lord; Sing praises on the harp to our God: 
Who covers the heaven with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who causes grass to spring up on the mountains, And green herb for the service of men; 
And gives to cattle their food, And to the young ravens that call upon him. 
He will not take pleasure in the strength of a horse; Neither is he well pleased with the legs of a man. 
The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, And in all that hope in his mercy.
