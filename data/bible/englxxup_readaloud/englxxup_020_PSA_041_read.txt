Psalms.
Chapter 41.
For the end, a Psalm for instruction, for the sons of Korah. 
As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, So my soul earnestly longs for thee, O God. 
My soul has thirsted for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God? 
My tears have been bread to me day and night, While they daily said to me, Where is thy God? 
I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, For I will go to the place of thy wondrous tabernacle, even to the house of God, With a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival. 
Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? Hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; He is the salvation of my countenance. 
O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the little hill. 
Deep calls to deep at the voice of thy cataracts: All thy billows and thy waves have gone over me. 
By day the Lord will command his mercy, And manifest it by night: With me is prayer to the God of my life. 
I will say to God, Thou art my helper; why hast thou forgotten me? Wherefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses me? 
While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; While they said to me daily, Where is thy God? 
Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? Hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; He is the health of my countenance, and my God.
