Psalms.
Chapter 14.
A Psalm of David. O Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? And who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? 
He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, Who speaks truth in his heart. 
Who has not spoken craftily with his tongue, Neither has done evil to his neighbor, Nor taken up a reproach against them that dwelt nearest to him. 
In his sight an evil-worker is set at nought, But he honors them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbor, and disappoints him not. 
He has not lent his money on usury, And has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.
