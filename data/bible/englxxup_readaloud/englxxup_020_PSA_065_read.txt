Psalms.
Chapter 65.
For the end, a Song of a Psalm of resurrection. Shout unto God, all the earth. 
O sing praises to his name; Give glory to his praise. 
Say unto God, How awful are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power thine enemies shall lie to thee. 
Let all the earth worship thee, and sing to thee; Let them sing to thy name. Pause. 
Come and behold the works of God; He is terrible in his counsels beyond the children of men. 
Who turns the sea into dry land; They shall go through the river on foot; There shall we rejoice in him, 
Who by his power is Lord over the age, His eyes look upon the nations; Let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves. Pause. 
Bless our God, ye Gentiles, And make the voice of his praise to be heard; 
Who quickens my soul in life, And does not suffer my feet to be moved. 
For thou, O God, hast proved us; Thou hast tried us with fire as silver is tried. 
Thou broughtest us into the snare; Thou laidest afflictions on our back. 
Thou didst mount men upon our heads; We went through fire and water; But thou broughtest us out into a place of refreshment. 
I will go into thy house with whole burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows, 
Which my lips framed, And my mouth uttered in my affliction. 
I will offer to thee whole burnt sacrifices full of marrow, With incense and rams; I will sacrifice to thee oxen with goats. Pause. 
Come, hear, and I will tell, All ye that fear God, How great things he has done for my soul. 
I cried to him with my mouth, and exalted him with my tongue. 
If I have regarded iniquity in my heart, Let not the Lord hearken to me. 
Therefore God has hearkened to me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer. 
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, Nor his mercy from me.
