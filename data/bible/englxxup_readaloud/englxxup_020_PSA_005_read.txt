Psalms.
Chapter 5.
For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits. 
Hearken to my words, O Lord, Attend to my cry. 
Attend to the voice of my supplication, My King, and my God: For to thee, O Lord, will I pray. 
In the morning thou shalt hear my voice: In the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up. 
For thou art not a God that desires iniquity; Neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee. 
Neither shall the transgressors continue in thy sight: Thou hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity. 
Thou wilt destroy all that speak falsehood: The Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man. 
But I will enter into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple. 
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make my way plain before thy face. 
For there is no truth in their mouth; Their heart is vain; Their throat is an open sepulcher; With their tongues they have used deceit. 
Judge them, O God; Let them fail of their counsels: Cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; For they have provoked thee, O Lord. 
But let all that trust on thee be glad in thee: They shall exult forever, and thou shalt dwell among them; And all that love thy name shall rejoice in thee. 
For thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: Thou hast compassed us as with a shield of favor.
