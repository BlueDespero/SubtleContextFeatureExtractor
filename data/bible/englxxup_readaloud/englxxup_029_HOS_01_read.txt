Hosea.
Chapter 1.
The word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, and Jotham, and Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel. 
The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea. And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take to thyself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication: for the land will surely go a-whoring in departing from the Lord. 
So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son. 
And the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Judah, and will make to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. 
And it shall be, in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel. 
And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said to him, Call her name, Unpitied: for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, but will surely set myself in array against them. 
But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them with bow, nor with sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by horsemen. 
And she weaned Unpitied; and she conceived again, and bore a son. 
And he said, Call his name, Not my people: for ye are not my people, and I am not your God.
