Psalms.
Chapter 56.
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. 
Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: For my soul has trusted in thee: And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, Until the iniquity have passed away. 
I will cry to God most high; The God who has benefited me. Pause. 
He sent from heaven and saved me; He gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth; 
And he has delivered my soul from the midst of lions’ whelps: I lay down to sleep, though troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are arms and missile weapons, And their tongue a sharp sword. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; And thy glory above all the earth. 
They have prepared snares for my feet, And have bowed down my soul: They have dug a pit before my face, And fallen into it themselves. Pause. 
My heart, O God, is ready, My heart is ready: I will sing, yea will sing psalms. 
Awake, my glory; Awake, psaltery and harp: I will awake early. 
O Lord, I will give thanks to thee among the nations: I will sing to thee among the Gentiles. 
For thy mercy has been magnified even to the heavens, And thy truth to the clouds. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; And thy glory above all the earth.
