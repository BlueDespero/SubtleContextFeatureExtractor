Psalms.
Chapter 47.
A Psalm of praise for the sons of Korah on the second day of the week. 
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 
The city of the great King Is well planted on the mountains of Zion, With the joy of the whole earth, on the sides of the north. 
God is known in her palaces, When he undertakes to help her. 
For, behold, the kings of the earth were assembled, They came together. 
They saw, and so they wondered: They were troubled, they were moved. 
Trembling took hold on them: There were the pangs as of a woman in travail. 
Thou wilt break the ships of Tarshish with a vehement wind. 
As we have heard, so have we also seen, In the city of the Lord of hosts, In the city of our God: God has founded it forever. Pause. 
We have thought of thy mercy, O God, In the midst of thy people. 
According to thy name, O God, So is also thy praise to the ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
Let Mount Zion rejoice, Let the daughters of Judea exult, Because of thy judgments, O Lord. 
Go round about Zion, and encompass her: Tell ye her towers. 
Mark ye well her strength, And observe her palaces; That ye may tell the next generation. 
For this is our God forever and ever: He will be our guide for evermore.
