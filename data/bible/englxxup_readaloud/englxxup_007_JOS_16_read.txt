Joshua.
Chapter 16.
And the borders of the children of Joseph were from Jordan by Jericho eastward; and they will go up from Jericho to the hill country, to the wilderness, to Bethel Luz. 
And they will go out to Bethel, and will proceed to the borders of Ataroth. 
And they will go across to the sea to the borders of Japhletites, as far as the borders of Beth-horon the lower, and the going forth of them shall be to the sea. 
And the sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, took their inheritance. 
And the borders of the children of Ephraim were according to their families, and the borders of their inheritance were eastward to Ataroth, and Eroc as far as Beth-horon the upper, and Gazara. 
And the borders will proceed to the sea to Icasmon north of Therma; they will go round eastward to Taanath, and Shiloh, and will pass on eastward to Janoah, 
and to Macho, and Ataroth, and these are their villages; and they will come to Jericho, and will issue at Jordan. 
And the borders will proceed from Tappuah to the sea to Kanah; and their termination will be at the sea; this is the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim according to their families. 
And the cities separated to the sons of Ephraim were in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages. 
And Ephraim did not destroy the Canaanite who dwelt in Gezer; and the Canaanite dwelt in Ephraim until this day, until Pharaoh the king of Egypt went up and took it, and burned it with fire; and the Canaanites, and Perizzites, and the dwellers in Gaza they destroyed, and Pharaoh gave them for a dowry to his daughter.
