Psalms.
Chapter 66.
For the end, a Psalm of David among the Hymns. 
God be merciful to us, and bless us; And cause his face to shine upon us. Pause. 
That men may know thy way on the earth, Thy salvation among all nations. 
Let the nations, O God, give thanks to thee; Let all the nations give thanks to thee. 
Let the nations rejoice and exult, For thou shalt judge the peoples in equity, And shalt guide the nations on the earth. Pause. 
Let the peoples, O God, give thanks to thee; Let all the peoples give thanks to thee. 
The earth has yielded her fruit; Let God, our God, bless us. 
Let God bless us; And let all the ends of the earth fear him.
