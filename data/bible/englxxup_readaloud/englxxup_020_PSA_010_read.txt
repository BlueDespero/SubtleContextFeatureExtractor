Psalms.
Chapter 10.
For the end, a Psalm of David. In the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Flee to the mountains as a sparrow? 
For behold the sinners have bent their bow, They have prepared their arrows for the quiver, To shoot privily at the upright in heart. 
For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, But what has the righteous done? 
The Lord is in his holy temple, As for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: His eyes look upon the poor, His eyelids try the sons of men. 
The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: And he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul. 
He shall rain upon sinners snares, Fire, and brimstone, and a stormy blast shall be the portion of their cup. 
For the Lord is righteous, and loves righteousness; His face beholds uprightness.
