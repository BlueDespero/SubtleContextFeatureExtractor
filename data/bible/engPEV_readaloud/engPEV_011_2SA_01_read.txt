2 Samuel.
Chapter 1.
The Philistia mob and the Israel mob fought each other on the hill called Gilboa. Saul died at that place. At the same time, David and his men fought the Amalek mob at another place. After they beat the Amalek mob, David and his men went back to the place called Ziklag. 
Then, 2 days later, a young man arrived at David’s camp. He came from the place where Saul’s mob had that big fight. Along the road he tore his clothes and put dirt on his head, to show that he had bad news. Then he came to David, got down on his knees with his face close to the ground, to show respect to him. 
David asked, “Where did you come from?” He answered, “I ran away from that hill called Gilboa, from that big fight.” 
David asked him, “What happened in that fight? Tell me.” He answered, “The Philistia mob killed dead lots of our soldiers, and our other soldiers ran away. Saul and his son Jonathan died too.” 
David and his mob were really sad for Saul and Jonathan. They tore their clothes to show they were upset. 
They cried until the sun went down, and they didn’t eat anything. Lots of God’s people died, so they were sad for them too, their countrymen, the Israel mob.
