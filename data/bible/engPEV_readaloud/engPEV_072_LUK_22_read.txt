Luke.
Chapter 22.
Jesus said to his followers, “Remember that time I told you to go to other towns and tell people God’s story, and I told you not to take a bag, or money, or extra shoes? Did you go short of anything at that time, or did you get everything you needed anyway?” They said, “We didn’t go short of anything.” 
Then Jesus said, “But it is different now. Listen, you are going to get a lot of trouble. So if you have a bag, take it with you. And if you have some money, take it with you. And you will need a long knife to fight with, too, so if you haven’t got one, sell your coat to get some money and buy one. 
You see, something is going to happen now that is in God’s book. A long time ago, God got one of his men to write this, ‘The people reckoned God’s man was bad, and they treated him the same way they treat bad criminals.’ Listen, I’m telling you, they are going to do that now. They are going to do it to me.” 
His followers said, “Sir, we’ve got 2 long knives here.” Jesus said, “We don’t need to talk about that any more.”
