Chapter 24.
The earth and everything in it belongs to Yahweh; all the people in the world belong to him, too, 
because he caused the ground to be above the water, above the water that was deep below the surface of the earth. 
Who will be allowed to go up on Zion Hill in Jerusalem, in order to stand and worship in Yahweh’s holy temple? 
Only those whose actions MTY and thoughts are pure, who have not worshiped idols, and who do not tell lies when they have solemnly promised to tell the truth. 
◄They will be blessed by Yahweh/Yahweh will bless them►. When God judges them, he, who has saved them, will say that they ◄have done nothing wrong/are without fault►. 
They are the ones who approach God, they are the ones who may worship God, the one we Israelis worship. 
Open up APO the temple gates in order that our glorious king may enter! 
Do you know who the glorious king is? He is Yahweh, the one who is very strong DOU; He is Yahweh, who conquers all his enemies in battles! 
Open up the temple gates in order that our glorious king may enter! 
Do you know who the glorious king is? He is Yahweh almighty; he is our glorious king!
