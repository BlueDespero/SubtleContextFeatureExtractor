2 CHRONICLES.
Chapter 27.
Jotham was 25 years old when he became the king of Judah. He ruled from Jerusalem for 16 years. His mother was Jerushah, the daughter of the priest Zadok. 
Jotham did many things that pleased Yahweh like his father Uzziah did. He obeyed Yahweh and did things that are right. He did many things that his father Uzziah had done, but he did not burn incense in the temple, like his father had done. However, the people of Judah continued to sin against Yahweh. 
Jotham’s workers rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple, and they did a lot of work to repair the wall near Ophel Hill. 
They built towns in the hills of Judah, and they built forts and defense towers in the forests. 
During the time that Jotham was the king of Judah, his army attacked and defeated the army of the Ammon people-group. Then, every year during the next three years, he required the Anmon people-group to pay to him four tons of silver, 60,000 bushels of wheat, and 60,000 bushels of barley. 
Jotham faithfully obeyed Yahweh his God, and as a result he became a very powerful king. 
A record of everything else that Jotham did during the time that he was the king, including the wars that his army fought, is written in the scroll called ‘the History of the Kings of Israel and Judah’. 
After Jotham had ruled Judah for 16 years, he died when he was 41 years old. 
He was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Ahaz became the king of Judah.
