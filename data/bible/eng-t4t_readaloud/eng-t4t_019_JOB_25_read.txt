“God is very powerful; everyone should have an awesome respect for him; he causes everything to be peaceful high up in heaven. 
◄Can anyone count the angels who are in his army in heaven?/No one can count the angels who are in his army in heaven.► RHQ ◄Is there any place where his light does not shine?/There is no place where his light does not shine.► RHQ 
So, ◄how can God consider anyone to be righteous?/God certainly cannot consider anyone to be righteous.► RHQ ◄How can any human being be truly pure?/No human being can be truly pure.► RHQ 
Consider this: God does not even consider the full moon to be bright, and he does not consider the stars to be spotless. 
So, ◄what about humans?/he does not consider humans to be important.► RHQ They are as insignificant as MET maggots. God does not think more highly of people than he thinks of worms.”
