MALACHI.
Chapter 4.
This is also what the Commander of the armies of angels says: “There will be a time that I will judge and punish people. When that happens, it will be like SIM a very hot furnace. At that time, all the proud and wicked people will be burned up like MET stubble burns. They will be burned up completely, like roots and branches and everything else on a tree burns completely in a very hot fire. 
But as for you who revere me MTY, the one who will save you will come to you like MET the sun shines in the morning, and enable you to become righteous (OR, do what is righteous); he will restore you and protect you like a bird protects its chicks MET under its wings. When he comes, you will be very joyful, like SIM calves that go out from a barn into the pasture leaping joyfully. 
At the time when I judge people, you will tread on wicked people as though SIM they were the dirt under your feet. That is what I, the Commander of the armies of angels, promise. 
Be sure to obey the laws that I gave to Moses, who served me well. Obey all the commandments and regulations that I gave him on Sinai Mountain, for all you people of Israel to obey. 
Listen to this: Some day I will send to you the prophet Elijah. He will arrive before the great and dreadful/terrible day when I, Yahweh, will judge and punish people. 
Because of what he preaches, parents and their children will love each other again IDM. If that does not happen, I will come and curse your country and destroy it.”
