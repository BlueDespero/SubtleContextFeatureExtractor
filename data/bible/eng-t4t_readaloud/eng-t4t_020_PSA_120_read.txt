PSALMS.
Chapter 120.
When I had troubles, I called out to Yahweh and he answered me. 
I prayed, “Yahweh, rescue/save me from people SYN, MTY who lie to me and try to deceive me!” 
You people who lie to me, I will tell you RHQ what God will do to you and what he will do to punish you. 
He will shoot sharp arrows at you like soldiers do, and he will burn you with red-hot coals from the wood of a broom tree. 
It is terrible for me, living among cruel/savage DOU people like those who live in Meshech region and Kedar region. 
I have lived for a long time among people who hate to live with others peacefully. 
Every time I talk about living together peacefully, they talk about starting a war.
