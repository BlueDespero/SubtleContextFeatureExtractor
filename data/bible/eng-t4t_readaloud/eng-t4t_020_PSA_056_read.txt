Chapter 56.
God, be merciful to me because men have harassed me; all day my enemies pursue me. 
My enemies harass me all day long; there are many of them who proudly attack me. 
But whenever I am afraid, I trust in you. 
God, I praise/thank you because you do what you have promised; I trust in you, and then I am not afraid. Ordinary humans certainly cannot RHQ harm me! 
All day long my enemies claim that I said things that I did not say (OR, try to destroy what I am doing); they are always thinking of ways to harm me. 
In order to cause trouble for me, they hide and watch everything that I do, waiting for an opportunity to kill me MTY. 
So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing; show that you are angry by defeating those people! 
You have counted all the times that I have been wandering alone/distressed; it is as though you have put all my tears in a bottle in order that you can see how much I have cried. You have counted my tears and written the number in your book. 
When I call out to you, my God, my enemies will be defeated; I know that will happen, because you are fighting for me. 
I praise/thank you that you do what you have promised; Yahweh, I will always praise you for that DOU. 
I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid. I know that humans cannot really RHQ harm me! 
I will bring to you the offering that I promised; I will bring an offering to you to thank you, 
because you have rescued me from being killed; you have kept me from stumbling. As a result, I will continue to live in your presence in the light that shines on those who are still alive (OR, in the light that enables people to live).
