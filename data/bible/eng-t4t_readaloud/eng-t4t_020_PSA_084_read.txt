Chapter 84.
Lord, you who are the Commander of the armies of angels, your temple is very beautiful! 
I SYN would like to be there; Yahweh, I desire that very much DOU. With all of my inner being I sing joyfully to you, the all-powerful God. 
Even sparrows and swallows have built nests near your temple, where you protect them DOU; they take care of their young babies near the altars where people offer sacrifices to you, who are the commander of the armies of heaven, and my king and my God. 
◄Happy are/You are pleased with► those who ◄live/continually worship► in your temple, constantly singing to praise you. 
Happy are those who know that you are the one who causes them to be strong, those who strongly desire to ◄make the trip/go► to Zion Hill. 
While they travel through the dry Baca Valley, you cause it to become a place where there are springs of water, where the rains ◄in the autumn/before the cold season► fill the valley with pools of water. 
As a result, those who travel through there become stronger/refreshed knowing that they will appear in your presence ◄on Zion Hill/in Jerusalem►. 
Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, listen to my prayer; God, who is worshiped by us ◄descendants of Jacob/Israeli people►, hear IDM what I am saying! 
God, be kind to IDM our king, the one who protects us MTY, the one whom you have chosen MTY to rule us. 
For me, spending one day in your temple is better than spending 1,000 days somewhere else; standing at the entrance to your temple, ready to go inside, is better than living in the tents/homes where wicked people live. 
Yahweh our God is like the sun that shines on us and like a shield that protects us MET; he is kind to us and honors us. Yahweh does not refuse to give any good thing/blessing to those who do what is right. 
Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, ◄happy are/you are pleased with► those who trust in you!
