Chapter 57.
God, be merciful to me! Act mercifully toward me because I come to you to protect me. I ask you to protect me like little birds are protected under their mother’s wings MET until the storm/danger is ended. 
God, you who are greater than all other gods, I cry out to you, the one who enables me to do all that you desire. 
You will answer me from heaven and rescue me, but you will cause those who oppress me to be defeated and disgraced! (Think about that!) God will always faithfully love me and ◄will be faithful/will do what he promises►. 
Sometimes I am surrounded by my enemies who are like lions that kill humans; they are like lions that chew with their teeth animals that they kill; but my enemies have spears and arrows, not teeth; and the false things that they say MTY hurt people as much as sharp swords hurt people MET. 
God, show in the heavens that you are very great! And show your glory to people all over the earth! 
It is as if MET, HYP my enemies spread a net to seize me, and I became very distressed IDM. It is as if MET, HYP they dug a deep pit along the path where I walk, but they themselves fell into it! 
God, I have complete confidence DOU in you. I will sing to you, and I will praise you while I sing. 
I will awaken myself; I will arise before the sun rises and praise you while I play my harp or my ◄lyre/small harp►. 
Lord, I will thank you among all the people; and I will sing to praise you among many ethnic groups, 
because your faithful love for us is as great as the distance from the earth to the sky, and because your ◄faithfulness/faithfully doing what you promise► is as great as the distance up to the clouds MET. 
God, show in the heavens that you are very great! And show your glory to people all over the earth!
