Chapter 128.
◄Happy are/Yahweh is pleased with► those of you who revere him and do what he wants you to do IDM. 
You will be able to earn the money that you MTY need to buy food; you will be happy and you will be prosperous. 
Your wife will be like a grapevine that bears many grapes SIM; she will give birth to many children. Your children who sit around your table will be like a strong olive tree that has many shoots growing up around it SIM. 
Every man who reveres Yahweh will be blessed like that. 
I wish/hope that Yahweh will bless all of you from where he dwells ◄on Zion Hill/in Jerusalem► and that you will see the people of Jerusalem prospering every day that you live! 
I desire that you will live many years, long enough to see your grandchildren. I desire/hope that things will go well for the people in Israel!
