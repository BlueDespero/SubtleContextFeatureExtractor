Chapter 93.
Yahweh, you are the King! You are majestic, and the power that you have is like MET a robe that a king wears. You put the world firmly in place, and it will never be moved/shaken. 
You ruled as king a very long time ago; you have always existed. 
Yahweh, when you created the world, you separated the water from the chaotic mass and formed oceans, and the waves of the waters of those oceans still roar, 
but you are greater than the roar of those oceans, more powerful than the ocean waves! You are Yahweh, the one who is greater than any other god! 
Yahweh, your laws never change, and your temple has always been holy/sacred. And that will be true forever.
