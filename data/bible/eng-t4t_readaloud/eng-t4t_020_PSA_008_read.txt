Chapter 8.
Yahweh, our Lord, people all over the world know that you MTY are very great! Your glory reaches up higher than the heavens! 
You have taught little children and infants to praise you; they cause your enemies and those who try to ◄get revenge on/get rid of► you to be silent. 
When I look up at the sky at night, and see the things that you have made— the moon and the stars that you have set in place— 
it is amazing to me that RHQ you think about people, that you are concerned about us humans! 
You made the angels in heaven to be only a little more important than we are; you caused us to be like kings MET and you gave us splendor and honor DOU! 
You put us in charge of everything that you made; you gave us authority over all things— 
the sheep and the cattle, and even the wild animals, 
the birds, the fish, and everything else that swims in the seas. 
Yahweh, our Lord, people all over the world know that you MTY are very great!
