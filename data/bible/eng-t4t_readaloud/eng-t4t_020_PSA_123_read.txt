Chapter 123.
Yahweh, I look up toward you, up to heaven, from where you rule. 
Like servants ask IDM their masters for what they need and like maids ask t their mistresses for what they need, we ask you, Yahweh our God, for what we need, and we ask you to be merciful to us. 
Yahweh, be very merciful DOU to us because our enemies have acted very contemptuously toward us. 
Rich people have made fun of us for a long time, and proud people who have ◄oppressed/acted cruelly toward► us have acted toward us as though we were worthless.
