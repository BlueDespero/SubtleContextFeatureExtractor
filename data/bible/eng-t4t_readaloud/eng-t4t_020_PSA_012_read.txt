Chapter 12.
Yahweh, help us! It seems that people who are loyal to you have all vanished. 
Everyone tells lies to other people; they deceive others by ◄flattering them/saying good things about them that they know are not true►. 
Yahweh, we wish that you would cut off their tongues so that they cannot continue to boast. 
They say, “By telling lies we will get what we want; we control what we say MTY, so no one can tell us what we should not do!” 
But Yahweh replies, “I have seen the violent things that they have done to helpless people; and I have heard those people groaning, so I will arise and rescue the people who are wanting me to help them.” 
Yahweh, you always do what you have promised to do; what you have promised is as precious and pure as silver that has been heated seven times in a furnace to get rid of all the impure material. 
Wicked people strut around proudly, and people praise them for doing vile/wicked deeds, but Yahweh, we know that you will protect/rescue us from those wicked people.
