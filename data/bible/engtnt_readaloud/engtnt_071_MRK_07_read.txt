Mark.
Chapter 7.
And the pharises came togedder vnto him and dyvers of the scribes which came from Ierusalem. 
And when they sawe certayne of his disciples eate breed with comen hondes (that is to saye with vnwesshen hondes) they complayned. 
For the pharises and all the Iewes excepte they washe their hondes ofte eate not observinge the tradicions of the elders. 
And when they come from the market except they washe they eate not. And many other thinges ther be which they have taken apon them to observe as the wasshinge of cuppes and cruses and of brasen vessels and of tables. 
Then axed him the pharises and scribes why walke not thy disciples accordinge to the tradicions of the elders but eate breede with vnweshen hondes? 
He answered and sayde vnto them: well prophesied Esaias of you ypocrites as it is writte: This people honoreth me with their lyppes but their hert is farre from me: 
In vayne they worshippe me teachinge doctryns which are nothinge but the comaundementes of men. 
For ye laye the commaundement of God aparte and observe the tradicions of men as the wesshinge of cruses and of cuppes and many other suche lyke thinges ye do. 
And he sayde vnto them: well ye cast asyde the comaundement of God to mayntayne youre owne tradicions. 
For Moses sayde: Honoure thy father and thy mother: and whosoever cursseth father or mother let him dye for it. 
But ye saye: a man shall saye to father or mother Corban: which is: that thou desyrest of me to helpe the with is geven God. 
And so ye soffre him no more to do ought for his father or his mother 
makinge the worde of God of none effecte through youre awne tradicions which ye have ordeyned. And many soche thinges ye do. 
And he called all the people vnto him and sayde vnto them: Herken vnto me every one of you and vnderstonde. 
There is no thinge with out a man that can defyle him when it entreth into him: but thoo thinges which procede out of him are those which defyle the man. 
If eny man have eares to heare let him heare 
And when he came to house awaye from the people his disciples axed him of the similitude. 
And he sayd vnto them: Are ye so without vnderstondinge? Do ye not yet perceave that whatsoever thinge from with out entreth into a man it can not defyle him 
because it entrith not in to his hert but into the belly: and goeth out into the draught that porgeth oute all meates. 
And he sayde: that defileth a man which cometh oute of a man. 
For from with in even oute of the herte of men proceade evill thoughtes: advantry fornicacion murder 
theeft coveteousnes wickednes diceyte vnclennes and a wicked eye blasphemy pryde folysshnes: 
all these evyll thinges come from with in and defile a man. 
And from thence he rose and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon and entred into an housse and wolde that no man should have knowen: But he coulde not be hyd. 
For a certayne woman whose doughter had a foule sprete hearde of him and came and fell at his fete. 
The woman was a Greke oute of Syrophenicia and she besought him that he wolde caste out the devyll oute of her doughter. 
And Iesus sayde vnto her: let the chyldren fyrst be feed. For it is not mete to take the chyldres breed and to caste it vnto whelppes. 
She answered and sayde vnto him: even soo master neverthelesse the whelppes also eate vnder the table of the chyldrens cromes. 
And he sayde vnto her: for this sayinge goo thy waye the devyll is gone out of thy doughter. 
And when she was come home to her housse she founde the devyll departed and her doughter lyinge on the beed. 
And he departed agayne from the coostes of Tyre and Sidon and came vnto the see of Galile thorowe the middes of the coostos of the .x. cities. 
And they brought vnto him one that was deffe and stambred in his speche and prayde him to laye his honde apon him. 
And he toke him asyde from the people and put his fyngers in his eares and dyd spyt and touched his tounge 
and loked vp to heven and sygthed and sayde vnto him: ephatha that is to saye be openned. 
And streyght waye his eares were openned and the stringe of his tounge was loosed and he spake playne. 
And he commaunded them that they shuld tell no man. But the more he forbad them soo moche the more a greate deale they publesshed it: 
and were beyonde measure astonyed sayinge: He hath done all thinges well and hath made booth the deffe to heare and the dome to speake.
