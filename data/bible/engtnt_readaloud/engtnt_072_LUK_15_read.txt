Then resorted vnto him all the publicans and synners for to heare him. 
And the pharises and scribes murmured sayinge: He receaved to his company synners and eateth with them. 
Then put he forthe this similitude to the sayinge: 
What man of you havynge an hundred shepe yf he loose one of thee doth not leve nynty and nyne in the wyldernes and goo after that which is loost vntyll he fynde him? 
And when he hath founde him he putteth him on his shulders with ioye: 
And assone as he cometh home he calleth to gedder his lovers and neghbours sayinge vnto them: reioyse with me for I have founde my shepe which was loost. 
I say vnto you that lyke wyse ioye shalbe in heven over one synner that repenteth moore then over nynety and nyne iuste persons whiche nede noo repentaunce. 
Ether what woman havynge .x. grotes yf she loose one doth not lyght a candell and swepe the housse and seke diligently tyll she fynde it? 
And when she hath founde it she calleth her lovers and her neghbours sayinge: Reioyce with me for I have founde the groate which I had loost. 
Lykwyse I saye vnto you ioye is made in the presence of the angels of god over one synner that repenteth. 
And he sayde: a certayne man had two sonnes 
and the yonger of them sayde to his father: father geve me my parte of the goodes that to me belongeth. And he devided vnto them his substaunce. 
And not longe after the yonger sonne gaddered all that he had to gedder and toke his iorney into a farre countre and theare he wasted his goodes with royetous lyvinge. 
And when he had spent all that he had ther rose a greate derth thorow out all that same londe and he began to lacke. 
And he went and clave to a citesyn of that same countre which sent him to his felde to kepe his swyne. 
And he wold fayne have filled his bely with the coddes that the swyne ate: and noo man gave him. 
Then he came to him selfe and sayde: how many hyred servauntes at my fathers have breed ynough and I dye for honger. 
I will aryse and goo to my father and will saye vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and before the 
and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne make me as one of thy hyred servauntes. 
And he arose and went to his father. And when he was yet a greate waye of his father sawe him and had compassion and ran and fell on his necke and kyssed him. 
And the sonne sayd vnto him: father I have synned agaynst heven and in thy sight and am no moare worthy to be called thy sonne. 
But his father sayde to his servautes: bringe forth that best garment and put it on him and put a rynge on his honde and showes on his fete. 
And bringe hidder that fatted caulfe and kyll him and let vs eate and be mery: 
for this my sonne was deed and is alyve agayne he was loste and is now founde. And they began to be merye. 
The elder brother was in the felde and when he cam and drewe nye to the housse he herde minstrelcy and daunsynge 
and called one of his servauntes and axed what thoose thinges meate. 
And he sayd vnto him: thy brother is come and thy father had kylled the fatted caulfe because he hath receaved him safe and sounde. 
And he was angry and wolde not goo in. Then came his father out and entreated him. 
He answered and sayde to his father: Loo these many yeares have I done the service nether brake at eny tyme thy commaundment and yet gavest thou me never soo moche as a kyd to make mery with my lovers: 
but assone as this thy sonne was come which hath devoured thy goodes with harlootes thou haste for his pleasure kylled the fatted caulfe. 
And he sayd vnto him: Sonne thou wast ever with me and all that I have is thyne: 
it was mete that we shuld make mery and be glad: for this thy brother was deed and is a lyve agayne: and was loste and is founde.
