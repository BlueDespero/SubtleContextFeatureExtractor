Chapter 4.
The sprete speaketh evydently that in the latter tymes some shall departe from the fayth and shall geve hede vnto spretes of erroure and dyvelysshe doctrine 
of them which speake falce thorow ypocrisye and have their consciences marked with an hote yron 
forbyddinge to mary and commaundinge to abstayne from meates which God hath created to be receaved with gevynge thankes of them which beleve and knowe the trueth. 
For all the creatures of God are good and nothynge to be refused yf it be receaved with thankes gevynge. 
For it is sanctyfyed by the worde of God and prayer. 
Yf thou shalt put the brethren in remembraunce of these thynges thou shalt be a good minister of Iesu Christ which hast bene norisshed vp in the wordes of the fayth and good doctryne which doctryne thou hast continually followed. 
But cast awaye vngostly and olde wyves fables. Exercyse thy silfe vnto godlines. 
For bodely exercise proffiteth lyttll: But godlines is good vnto all thynges as a thynge which hath promyses of the lyfe that is now and of the lyfe to come. 
This is a sure sayinge and of all parties worthy to be receaved. 
For therfore we laboure and suffre rebuke because we beleve in the livynge god which is the savioure of all men: but specially of those that beleve. 
Suche thynges commaunde and teache. 
Let no man despyse thy youth: but be vnto them that beleve an insample in worde in conversacion in love in sprete in fayth and in purenes. 
Till I come geve attendaunce to redynge to exhortacion and to doctryne. 
Despyse not the gyfte that is in ye which was geven the thorow prophesye and with layinge on of the hondes of an elder. 
These thynges exercyse and geve thy silfe vnto them that it maye be sene how thou profetest in all thinges. 
Take hede vnto thy silfe and vnto learnynge and continue therin. For if thou shalt so do thou shalt save thy silfe and them that heare the.
