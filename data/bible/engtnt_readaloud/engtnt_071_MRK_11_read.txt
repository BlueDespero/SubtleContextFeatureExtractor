Chapter 11.
And when they came nye to Hierusalem vnto Bethphage and Bethanie besydes mout olivete he sent forth two of his disciples 
and sayde vnto the: Goo youre wayes into the toune that is over agaynst you. And assone as ye be entred into it ye shall fynde a coolte bounde wheron never man sate: loose him and bringe him. 
And if eny man saye vnto you: why do ye soo? Saye that the Lorde hath neade of him: and streight waye he will sende him hidder. 
And they wet their waye and foud a coolte tyed by the dore with out in a place where two wayes met and they losed him. 
And divers of the that stode there sayde vnto the: what do ye loosinge the coolte? 
And they sayd vnto them even as Iesus had commaunded the. And they let them goo. 
And they brought the coolte to Iesus and caste their garmetes on him: and he sate vpo him. 
And many sprede there garmetes in the waye. Other cut doune brauches of the trees and strawed them in the waye. 
And they that went before and they that folowed cryed sayinge: Hos anna: blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lorde. 
Blessed be the kingdome that cometh in the name of him that is Lorde of oure father David. Hos anna in the hyest. 
And the Lorde entred in to Ierusalem and into the temple. And when he had loked roudabout vpon all thinges and now the even tyde was come he went out vnto Bethany with the twelve. 
And on the morowe when they were come out from Bethany he hungred 
and spyed a fygge tree a farre of havinge leves and wet to se whether he myght finde eny thinge ther on. But when he came therto he foude no thinge but leves: for the tyme of fygges was not yet. 
And Iesus answered and sayde to it: never man eate frute of the here after whill the worlde stondith. And his disciples hearde it. 
And they came to Ierusalem. And Iesus wet into the temple and begane to cast out the sellers and byers in the temple and overthrewe the tables of the money chaungers and the stoles of them that solde doves: 
and wolde not suffre that eny man caried a vessell thorow the temple. 
And he taught sayinge vnto them is it not written: my housse shalbe called the housse of prayer vnto all nacions? But ye have made it a deen of theves. 
And the Scribes and hye prestes hearde that and sought howe to distroye him. For they feared him because all the people marveled at his doctrine. 
And when even was come he went out of the cite. 
And in the mornynge as they passed by they sawe the fygge tree dryed vp by the rotes. 
And Peter remembred and sayde vnto him: master beholde the fygge tree which thou cursedest is widdred awaye. 
And Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Have confides in God. 
Verely I saye vnto you that whosoever shall saye vnto this mountayne: take awaye thy silfe and cast thy silfe in to the see and shall not waver in his herte but shall beleve that those thinges which he sayeth shall come to passe what soever he sayeth shalbe done to him. 
Therfore I saye vnto you what soever ye desyre when ye praye beleve that ye shall have it and it shalbe done vnto you. 
And when ye stod and praye forgeve yf ye have eny thinge agaynste eny man that youre father also which is in heven maye forgeve you youre trespases. 
And they came agayne to Hierusalem. And as he walked in the temple ther came to him the hye prestes and the Scribes and the elders 
and sayd vnto him: by what auctorite doest thou these thinges? and who gave the this auctorite to do these thinges? 
Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: I will also axe of you a certayne thinge: and answere ye me and I wyll tell you by what auctorite I do these thinges. 
The baptyme of Iohn was it from heven or of men? Answer me. 
And they thought in them selves sayinge: yf we shall saye from heven: he will saye why then dyd ye not beleve him? 
but if we shall saye of me: then feare we the people. For all men counted Iohn that he was a verie Prophete. 
And they answered and sayd vnto Iesu: we cannot tell. And Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: nether wyll I tell you by what auctorite I do these thynges.
