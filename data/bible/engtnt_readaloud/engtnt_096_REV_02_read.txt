Revelation.
Chapter 2.
Unto the messenger of the congregacion of Ephesus wryte: These thynges sayth he that holdeth the vii. starres in his right honde and walketh in the myddes of the vii. golden candlestyckes. 
I knowe thy workes and thy labour and thy pacience and howe thou cannest not forbeare the which are evyll: and examinedst them which saye they are Apostles and are not: and hast founde them lyars 
and dydest wasshe thy self. And hast pacience: and for my names sake hast labored and hast not faynted. 
Neverthelesse I have sumwhat agaynst the for thou haste lefte thy fyrst love. 
Remember therfore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the fyrst workes. Or elles I wyll come vnto the shortly and will remove thy candlestyke out of his place excepte thou repent. 
But this thou haste because thou hatest the dedes of the Nicolaitans which dedes I also hate. 
Lett him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions. To him that overcometh will I geve to eate of the tree of lyfe which is in the myddes of the paradice of god. 
And vnto the angell of the congregacion of Smyrna wryte: These thynges sayth he that is fyrst and the laste which was deed and is alive. 
I knowe thy workes and tribulacion and poverte but thou art ryche: And I knowe the blaspemy of them whiche call them selves Iewes and are not: but are the congregacion of sathan. 
Feare none of thoo thynges which thou shalt soffre. Beholde the devyll shall caste of you into preson to tempte you and ye shall have tribulacion .x. dayes. Be faythfull vnto the deeth and I will geve the a croune of lyfe. 
Let him that hath ears heare what the sprete sayth to the congregacions: He that overcometh shall not be hurte of the seconde deeth. 
And to the messenger of the congregacion in Pergamos wryte: This sayth he which hath the sharpe swearde with two edges. 
I knowe thy workes and where thow dwellest evyn where Sathans seat ys and thou kepest my name and hast not denyed my fayth. And in my dayes Antipas was a faythfull witnes of myne which was slayne amonge you where sathan dwelleth. 
But I have a fewe thynges agaynst the: that thou hast there they that mayntayne the doctryne of Balam which taught in balake to put occasion of syn before the chylderne of Israhell that they shulde eate of meate dedicat vnto ydoles and to commyt fornicacion. 
Even so hast thou them that mayntayne the doctryne of the Nicolaytans which thynge I hate. 
But be converted or elles I will come vnto the shortly and will fyght agaynste the with thes wearde of my mouth 
Lett him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth vnto the congregacions: To him that overcommeth will I geve to eate manna that is hyd and will geve him a whyte stone and in the stone a newe name wrytten which no man knoweth savinge he that receaveth it. 
And vnto the messenger of the congregacion of Theatira write: This sayth the sonne of god which hath his eyes lyke vnto a flame of fyre whose fete are like brasse: 
I knowe thy workes and thy love service and fayth and thy paciece and thy dedes which are mo at the last then at the fyrste. 
Notwitstondinge I have a feawe thynges agaynst the that thou sofferest that woman Iesabell which called her sylfe a prophetes to teache and to deceave my servauntes to make them commyt fornicacion and to eate meates offered vppe vnto ydoles. 
And I gave her space to repent of her fornicacion and she repented not. 
Beholde I will caste her into a beed and them that commyt fornicacion with her into gret adversite excepte they tourne from their deades. 
And I will kyll her children with deeth. And all the congregacions shall knowe that I am he which searcheth the reynes and hertes. And I will geve vnto evere one of you accordynge vnto youre workes. 
Vnto you I saye and vnto other of them of Thiatyra as many as have not this lerninge and which have not knowen the depnes of Sathan (as they saye) I will put apon you none other burthe 
but that which ye have alreddy. Holde fast tyll I come 
and whosoever overcometh and kepeth my workes vnto the ende to hym will I geve power over nacions 
and he shall rule them with a rodde of yron: and as the vessels of a potter shall he breake them to shevers. Even as I receaved of my father 
euen so will I geve him the mornynge starre. 
Let him that hath eares heare what the sprete sayth to the congregacions.
