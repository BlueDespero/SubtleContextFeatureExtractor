but now is opened by the scriptures of prophesie at the commaundement of the everlastinge god to stere vp obedience to the faith publisshed amonge all nacions: 
To the same God which alone is wyse be prayse thorowe Iesus Christ for ever. Amen. ‘To the Romayns. Sent from Chorinthum by Phebe she that was the minister vnto the congregacion at Chenchrea.’
