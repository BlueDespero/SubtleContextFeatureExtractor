2 Corinthians.
Chapter 6.
We as helpers therfore exhorte you that ye receave not the grace of god in (vayne) 
For he saith: I have hearde the in a tyme accepted: and in the daye of saluacion have I suckered the. Beholde now is that well accepted tyme: beholde now is that daye of saluacion. 
Let vs geve no man occasion of evyll that in oure office be founde no faute: 
but in all thynges let vs behave oure selves as the ministers of God. In moche pacience in affliccions in necessite in anguysshe 
in strypes in presonmet in stryfe in laboure in watchinge in fastyng 
in purenes in knowledge in longe sufferynge in kyndnes in the holy goost in love vnfayned 
in the wordes of trueth in the power of God by the armoure of rightewesnes on the right honde and on the lyfte 
in honoure and dishonoure in evyll reporte and good reporte as desceauers and yet true 
as unknowen and yet knowen: as dyinge and beholde we yet live: as chastened and not killed: 
as sorowynge and yet alwaye mery: as poore and yet make many ryche: as havynge nothynge and yet possessynge all thynges. 
O ye Corinthyans oure mouth is open vnto you. Oure herte is made large: 
ye are in no strayte in vs but are in a strayte in youre awne bowelles: 
I promyse you lyke rewarde with me as to my childre. Set youreselues therfore at large 
and beare not a straugers yoke wyth the vnbelevers. For what fellishippe hath rightewesnes with vnrightewesnes? What company hath light with darcknes? 
What concorde hath Christ with beliall? Ether what parte hath he that beleveth with an infidele? 
how agreeth the temple of god with ymages? And ye are the temple of that lyuynge god as sayde god. I will dwell amonge the and walke amonge the and wilbe their god: and they shalbe my people. 
Wherfore come out from amonge the and separate youreselues (sayth the lorde) and touche none vncleane thynge: so wyll I receave you 
and wilbe a father vnto you and ye shalbe vnto me sonnes and doughters sayth the lorde almyghty.
