Revelation.
Chapter 5.
And I sawe in the right honde of him that sat in the trone a boke written with in and on the backside sealyd with vii. seales. 
And I sawe a stronge angell which cryed with a loude voyce: Who is worthy to open the boke and to loose the seales ther of. 
And no man in heven ner in erth nether vnder the erth was able to open the boke nether to loke thereon. 
And I wepte moche because no man was founde worthy to open and to rede the boke nether to loke thereon. 
And one of the elders sayde unto me: wepe not: Beholde a lion beinge of the tribe of Iuda the rote of Dauid hath obtayned to open the boke and to lose the vii. seales ther of. 
And I behelde and loo in the myddes of the seate and of the .iiii. bestes and in the myddes of the elders stode a lambe as though he had bene kylled which had vii. hornes and vii. eyes which are the spretes of God sent into all the worlde. 
And he cam and toke the boke oute of the right honde of him that sate apon the seate. 
And when he had take the boke the .iiii. bestes and xxiiii. elders fell doune before the labe havynge harpes and golden vialles full of odoures which are the prayers of saynctes 
and they songe a newe songe saynge: thou art worthy to take the boke and to open the seales therof: for thou waste kylled and haste redemed vs by thy bloud out of all kynreddes and tonges and people and nacions 
and haste made vs vnto oure god kynges and prestes and we shall raygne on the erth. 
And I behelde and I herd the voyce of many angylles aboute the trone and about the bestes and the elders and I herde thousand thousandes 
saynge with a lowde voyce: Worthy is the lambe that was killed to receave power and riches and wisdom and strenghte and honoure and glory and blyssynge. 
And all creatures which are in heven and on the erth and vnder the erth and in the see and all that are in them herd I sayinge: blyssinge honour glory and power be vnto hym that sytteth apon the seate and vnto the lambe for ever more. 
And the .iiii. bestes sayd: Amen. And the .xxiiii. elders fell apon their faces and worshypped him that lyveth for ever more.
