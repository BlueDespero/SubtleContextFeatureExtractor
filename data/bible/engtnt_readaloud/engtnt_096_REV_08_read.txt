Revelation.
Chapter 8.
And when he had opened the seventh seale there was silence in heven aboute the space of halfe an houre. 
And I sawe angelles stondynge before god and to them were geven vii. trompettes. 
And another angell cam and stode before the aultre havynge a golden senser and moche of odoures was geven vnto him that he shulde offre of the prayers of all saynctes apon the golden aultre which was before the seate. 
And the smoke of the odoures which came of the prayers of all saynctes ascended vppe before god out of the angelles honde. 
And the angell toke the senser and fylled it with fyre of the aultre and caste it into the erth and voyces were made and thondrynges and lightnynges and erthquake. 
And the .vii. angells which had the .vii. tropettes prepared them selves to blowe. 
The fyrst angell blewe and there was made hayle and fyre which were myngled with bloud and they were caste into the erth: and the thryd parte of trees was burnt and all grene grasse was brent. 
And the seconde angell blewe: and as it were a gret mountayne: burnynge with fyre was caste in to the see 
and the thyrde parte of the see tourned to bloud and the thyrde parte of the creatures which had lyfe dyed and the thyrde part of shippes were destroyed. 
And the thyrde angell blewe and ther fell a grett starre from heven burnynge as it were a lampe and it fell into the thyrde parte of the ryvers and into fountaynes of waters 
and the name of the starre is called wormwod. And the thyrde part was turned to wormwod. And many me dyed of the waters because they were made bytter. 
And the fourth angell blew and the thyrde parte of the sunne was smytten and the thyrde parte of the mone and the thyrde part of starres: so that the thyrde parte of them was darckned. And the daye was smytten that the thyrde part of it shulde not shyne and lyke wyse the nyght. 
And I behelde and herd an angell flyinge thorowe the myddes of heven sayinge with a lowde voyce: Woo wo to the inhabiters of the erth because of the voyces to come of the trompe of the .iii. angells which were yet to blowe.
