1 Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
Though I spake with the tonges of me and angels and yet had no love I were even as soundinge brasse: or as a tynklynge Cymball. 
And though I coulde prophesy and vnderstode all secretes and all knowledge: yee yf I had all fayth so that I coulde move mountayns oute of ther places and yet had no love I were nothynge. 
And though I bestowed all my gooddes to fede the poore and though I gave my body even that I burned and yet had no love it profeteth me nothinge. 
Love suffreth longe and is corteous. Love envieth not. Love doth not frowardly swelleth not 
dealeth not dishonestly seketh not her awne is not provoked to anger thynketh not evyll 
reioyseth not in iniquite: but reioyseth in the trueth 
suffreth all thynge beleveth all thynges hopeth all thynges endureth in all thynges. 
Though that prophesyinge fayle other tonges shall cease )or knowledge vanysshe awaye yet love falleth never awaye. 
For oure knowledge is vnparfect and oure prophesyinge is vnperfet. 
But when that which is parfect is come then that which is vnparfet shall be done awaye. 
When I was a chylde I spake as a chylde I vnderstode as a childe I ymagened as a chylde. But assone as I was a man I put awaye childesshnes. 
Now we se in a glasse even in a darke speakynge: but then shall we se face to face. Now I knowe vnparfectly: but then shall I knowe even as I am knowen. 
Now abideth fayth hope and love even these thre: but the chefe of these is love.
