I am Alpha and Omega the begynninge and the endinge sayth the Lorde almyghty which is and which was and which is to come. 
I Ihon youre brother and companyon in tribulacion and in the kyngdom and pacience which is in Iesu Christe was in the yle of Pathmos for the worde of god and for the witnessynge of Iesu Christe. 
I was in the sprete on a sondaye and herde behynde me a gret voyce as it had bene of a trompe 
sayinge: I am Alpha and Omega the fyrst and the laste. That thou seist write in a boke and sende it vnto the congregacions which are in Asia vnto Ephesus and vnto Smyrna and vnto Pargamos and vnto Thiatira and vnto Sardis and vnto Philadelphia and vnto Laodicia. 
And I turned backe to se the voyce that spake to me. And when I was turned: I sawe .vii golde candelstyckes 
and in the myddes of the candelstyckes one lyke vnto the sone of man clothed with a lynnen garmet doune to the ground and gyrd aboute the pappes with a golden gyrdle 
His heed and his heares were whyte as whyte woll and as snowe: and his eyes were as a flame of fyre: 
and his fete lyke vnto brasse as though they brent in a fornace: and his voyce as the sounde of many waters. 
And he had in his right honde vii. starres. And out of his mouth wet a sharpe twoo edged swearde. And his face shone even as the sonne in his strength. 
And when I sawe him I fell at his fete even as deed. And he layde hys ryght honde apon me sayinge vnto me: feare not. I am the fyrst and the laste 
and am alyve and was deed. And beholde I am alyve for ever more and have the kayes of hell and of deeth. 
wryte therfore the thynges which thou haste sene and the thynges which are and the thynges which shalbe fulfylled hereafter: 
and the mystery of the vii. starres which thou sawest in my ryght honde and the vii. golden candelstyckes. The vii. stares are the messengers of the vii. congregacions: And the vii. candlestyckes which thou sawest are the vii. congregacions.
