Hebrews.
Chapter 8.
Of the thynges which we have spoke this is the pyth: that we have soche an hye preste that is sitten on the right honde of the seate of maieste in heven 
and is a minister of holy thynges and of the very tabernacle which God pyght and not man. 
For every hye prest is ordeyned to offer gyftes and sacryfises wherfore it is of necessitie that this man have somewhat also to offer. 
For he were not a preste yf he were on the erth where are prestes that acordynge to the lawe offer giftes 
which prestes serve vnto the ensample and shadowe of hevenly thynges: even as the answer of God was geven vnto Moses when he was about to fynnishe the tabernacle: Take hede (sayde he) that thou make all thynges accordynge to the patrone shewed to the in the mount. 
Now hath he obtayned a more excellent office in as moche as he is the mediator of a better testament which was made for better promyses. 
For yf that fyrst testament had bene fautelesse: then shuld no place have bene sought for the seconde. 
For in rebukynge the he sayth: Beholde the dayes will come (sayth the lorde) and I will fynnyshe apon the housse of Israhel and apon the housse of Iuda a newe testament: 
not lyke the testament that I made with their fathers at that tyme when I toke them by the hondes to lede them oute of the londe of Egipte for they continued not in my testament and I regarded them not sayth the lorde. 
For this is the testament that I will make with the housse of Israhell: After those dayes sayth the lorde: I will put my lawes in their myndes and in their hertes I will wryte the and I wilbe their God and they shalbe my people. 
And they shall not teache every man his neghboure and every man his brother sayinge: knowe the lorde: For they shall knowe me from the lest to the moste of them: 
For I wilbe mercifull over their vnrightwesnes and on their synnes and on their iniquiries. 
In that he sayth a new testament he hath abrogat the olde. Now that which is disanulled and wexed olde is redy to vannysshe awaye.
