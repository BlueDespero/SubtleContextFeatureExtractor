John.
Chapter 6.
After these things Jesus went away across the lake of Galilee, that of Tiberias. 
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought on the diseased. 
And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples. 
And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. 
Jesus then lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great crowd was coming to him, saith to Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat? 
But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was going to do. 
Philip answered him, Two hundred denaries' worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a tittle. 
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him, 
There is a lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many? 
Jesus said, Make the men lie down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men lay down, in number about five thousand. 
Jesus then took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed to those that were lying down; in like manner also of the fishes, as much as they desired. 
And when they were filled, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain over, that nothing may be lost. 
So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to those that had eaten. 
The men therefore seeing the sign which he wrought, said, This is truly the prophet that was to come into the world. 
Jesus therefore, knowing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him a king, withdrew again to the mountain alone. 
But when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, 
and having gone on board a boat, were going over the lake to Capernaum. And darkness had overtaken them, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 
And as a strong wind was blowing, the waves ran high. 
When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the lake, and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid. 
But he saith to them, It is I, be not afraid. 
Then they were willing to receive him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going. 
The day following, the multitude which stood on the other side of the lake having seen that there was no other boat there but one, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone, 
(but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread, when the Lord had given thanks;) 
when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples, they went on board the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 
And having found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, Rabbi, when didst thou come hither? 
Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly do I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled. 
Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for the food that endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man giveth to you; for on him hath the Father set his seal, even God. 
Then they said to him, What are we to do, that we may work the works of God? 
Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he sent. 
They said therefore to him, What sign doest thou, that we may see, and believe thee? What dost thou work? 
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.” 
Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Moses hath not given you the bread from heaven; but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven. 
For the bread of God is that which is coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world. 
They said therefore to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 
Jesus therefore said to them, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me will not hunger; and he that believeth in me will never thirst. 
But I said to you, that ye have even seen, and do not believe. 
All that the Father giveth me will come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out; 
for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day. 
For this is the will of my Father, that every one who looketh on the Son and believeth in him, shall have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day. 
The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven; 
and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, one whose father and mother we know? How is it then that this man saith, I have come down from heaven? 
Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
No one can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day. 
It is written in the prophets, “And they shall all be taught of God.” Every one that hath heard the Father, and hath learnt from him, cometh to me. 
Not that any one hath seen the Father, but he who is from God; he hath seen the Father. 
Truly, truly do I say to you, He that believeth hath everlasting life. 
I am the bread of life. 
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died. 
This is the bread which is coming down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. 
I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eat of my bread, he will live for ever. Yea, and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. 
The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 
Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly do I say to you, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 
He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day. 
For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 
He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him. 
As the living Father sent me, and I live by reason of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live by reason of me. 
This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread will live for ever. 
These things he said in a synagogue, while teaching in Capernaum. 
Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This teaching is hard; who can listen to it? 
Jesus therefore knew within himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, and said to them, Doth this offend you? 
What then if ye behold the Son of man ascending where he was before? 
It is the spirit which maketh alive; the flesh profiteth nothing. The words which I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life. 
But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him. 
And he said, For this cause I have told you, that no one can come to me, unless it hath been given him from the Father. 
From this time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 
Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do ye also wish to go away? 
Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast words of everlasting life; 
and we have believed and known, that thou art the Holy One of God. 
Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you twelve? and one of you is a devil! 
He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; for it was he that was about to betray him, being one of the twelve.
