Mark.
Chapter 3.
And he entered again into a synagogue; and there was a man there having a withered hand; 
and they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him. 
And he saith to the man having the withered hand, Stand up in the midst. 
And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they were silent. 
And looking round on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored. 
And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately had a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake; and a great multitude from Galilee, and from Judaea followed; 
and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond the Jordan, and the people about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what great things he was doing, came to him. 
And he gave direction to his disciples, that a boat should be in readiness for him because of the multitude, that they might not throng him. 
For he had healed many, so that as many as had plagues pressed upon him to touch him. 
And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known. 
And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth to him whom he would; and they came to him. 
And he appointed twelve to be with him, and whom he might send forth to preach, 
and to have authority to cast out demons. And he appointed the twelve, 
and Simon he surnamed Peter; 
and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder; 
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon of Cana, 
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. And he cometh into the house. 
And again a multitude cometh together, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
And his relations hearing of it went out to lay hold of him; for they said, He is beside himself. 
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebul; and, He casteth out the demons through the prince of the demons. 
And calling them to him, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan? 
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand; 
and if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand; 
and if Satan rise up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end. 
Moreover, no one can enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house. 
Truly do I say to you, All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme; 
but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath no forgiveness forever, but is exposed to everlasting sin.— 
Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. 
And his mother and his brothers came; and, standing without, sent to him, to call him. 
And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Lo! thy mother and thy brothers and thy sisters are without, seeking for thee. 
And he answering saith to them, Who is my mother, and my brothers? 
And looking round on those who sat about him, he saith, Behold my mother and my brothers. 
Whoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
