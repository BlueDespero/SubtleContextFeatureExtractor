Psalms.
Chapter 82.
“A psalm of Asaph.” God standeth in God's assembly, He judgeth in the midst of the gods. 
“How long will ye judge unjustly, And favor the cause of the wicked? Pause. 
Defend the poor and the fatherless; Do justice to the wretched and the needy! 
Deliver the poor and the destitute; Save them from the hand of the wicked! 
They are without knowledge and without understanding; They walk in darkness: Therefore all the foundations of the land are shaken. 
I have said, Ye are gods, And all of you children of the Most High; 
But ye shall die like men, And fall like the rest of the princes.” 
Arise, O God! judge the earth! For all the nations are thy possession.
