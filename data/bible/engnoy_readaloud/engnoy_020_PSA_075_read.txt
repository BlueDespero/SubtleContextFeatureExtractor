Psalms.
Chapter 75.
“For the leader of the music. To the tune of “Do not destroy.” A psalm of Asaph.” We give thanks to thee, O God! we give thanks to thee, and near is thy name; Men shall declare thy wondrous deeds! 
“When I see my time, Then will I judge with equity. 
The earth trembleth, and all her inhabitants; But I uphold her pillars.” 
I say to the proud, Behave not proudly! To the wicked, Lift not up your horn! 
Lift not up your horn on high, And speak not with a stiff neck! 
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south; 
But it is God that judgeth; He putteth down one, and setteth up another. 
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup; The wine is foaming and full of spices, And of it he poureth out; Even to the dregs shall all the wicked of the earth drink it. 
Therefore I will extol him for ever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
“I will bring down all the power of the wicked; But the righteous shall lift up their heads.”
