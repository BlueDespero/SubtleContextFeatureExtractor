Isaiah.
Chapter 46.
Bel sinketh down; Nebo falleth; Their images are laid upon beasts and cattle; Those that ye once bore are packed upon them; A burden to the weary beast! 
They sink down; they fall together; They cannot rescue the burden; They themselves go into captivity. 
Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel; Ye that have been borne by me from your birth, That have been carried by me from your earliest breath! 
Even to your old age I am the same; Even to hoar hairs I will carry you; I have done it, and I will still bear you; I will carry, and will deliver you. 
To whom will ye liken me, and compare me? Yea, to whom will ye compare me, that we may be like? 
They lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver in the balance; They hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god; They fall down, yea, they worship it. 
They lift him upon the shoulder, and carry him; They set him in his place, and there he standeth; From his place he moveth not; Yea, one may cry to him, yet doth he not answer, Nor save him out of his distress. 
Remember these things, and show yourselves men; Lay them to heart, ye apostates! 
Remember the former things in ancient times! For I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me. 
Declaring the end from the beginning; From ancient times the things that were not yet done; Saying, My purpose shall stand, And I will do all my pleasure; 
Calling from the East the eagle, The man that executeth my purpose from a far country; I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it. 
Hearken to me, ye stubborn-hearted, That are far from deliverance! 
I have brought near my deliverance; it is not far off; My salvation shall not tarry; I will give to Zion salvation, To Israel, my glory.
