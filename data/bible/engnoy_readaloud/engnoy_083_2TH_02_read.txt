2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 2.
Now we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being assembled together unto him, 
that ye be not easily shaken in mind, nor troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, as if the day of the Lord were close at hand. 
Let no one deceive you in any manner; for that day will not come unless the apostasy shall have come first and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition; 
he that opposeth and exalteth himself above every one that is called God, or worthy of worship, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself to be God. 
Do ye not remember, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
And now ye know what restraineth, in order that he may be revealed in his own time. 
For the mystery of lawlessness is already working; only there is one who now restraineth, until he be taken out of the way; 
and then will the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will consume with the breath of his mouth, and destroy with the manifestation of his coming; 
he, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power, and signs, and wonders of falsehood, 
and in all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
And for this cause God sendeth them a working of delusion, that they may believe the falsehood; 
that they may all be judged, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 
But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth; 
whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the traditions which ye were taught by us, whether by word, or by our letter. 
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, our Father, who loved us, and gave us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, 
encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.
