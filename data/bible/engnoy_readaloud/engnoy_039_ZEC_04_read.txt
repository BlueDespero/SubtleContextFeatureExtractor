Zechariah.
Chapter 4.
And the angel that talked with me came again, and awaked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
and said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a chandelier all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps upon it, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top of it; 
and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side of it. 
And I spake, and said to the angel that talked with me, What mean these, my lord? 
Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Knowest thou not what these mean? And I said, No, my lord. 
Then he answered and spake to me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying:— Not by might, nor by power, But by my spirit, Saith Jehovah of hosts. 
What art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain! And he shall bring forth the corner-stone amid shoutings, The people crying, “Grace, grace be to it!” 
Moreover, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it. And thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me to you. 
For who hath despised the day of small things? With joy shall the plummet be seen in the hand of Zerubbabel by those seven; they are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth. 
Then I spake and said to him, What mean these two olive-trees, upon the right side of the chandelier and upon the left side thereof? 
And I spake the second time, and said to him, What mean these two olive-branches, which are by the side of the two golden tubes which empty the golden oil out of themselves? 
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these mean? And I said, No, my lord. 
And he said, These are the two anointed ones that stand before the Lord of all the earth.
