Psalms.
Chapter 124.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. By David.” If the LORD had not been for us, Now may Israel say, 
If the LORD had not been for us, When men rose up against us, 
Then had they swallowed us up alive, When their wrath burned against us; 
Then the waters had overwhelmed us; The stream had gone over our soul; 
The proud waters had gone over our soul. 
Blessed be the LORD, Who hath not given us a prey to their teeth! 
We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 
Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
