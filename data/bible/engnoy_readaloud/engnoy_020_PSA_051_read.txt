Psalms.
Chapter 51.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after his intercourse with Bathsheba.” Be gracious unto me, O God! according to thy loving kindness; According to the greatness of thy mercy, blot out my transgressions! 
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin! 
For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me. 
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And in thy sight have I done evil; So that thou art just in thy sentence, And righteous in thy judgment. 
Behold! I was born in iniquity, And in sin did my mother conceive me. 
Behold! thou desirest truth in the heart; So teach me wisdom in my inmost soul! 
Purge me with hyssop, until I be clean; Wash me, until I be whiter than snow! 
Make me to hear joy and gladness, So that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice! 
Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities! 
Create within me a clean heart, O God! Renew within me a steadfast spirit! 
Cast me not away from thy presence, And take not thy holy spirit from me! 
Restore to me the joy of thy protection, And strengthen me with a willing spirit! 
Then will I teach thy ways to transgressors, And sinners shall be converted to thee. 
Deliver me from the guilt of blood, O God, the God of my salvation! That my tongue may sing aloud of thy goodness! 
O Lord! open thou my lips, That my mouth may show forth thy praise! 
For thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou delightest not in burnt-offerings. 
The sacrifice which God loveth is a broken spirit; A broken and contrite heart, O God! thou wilt not despise! 
Do good to Zion according to thy mercy; Build up the walls of Jerusalem! 
Then shalt thou be pleased with sacrifices of righteousness, With burnt-offerings and complete offerings; Then shall bullocks be offered upon thine altar.
