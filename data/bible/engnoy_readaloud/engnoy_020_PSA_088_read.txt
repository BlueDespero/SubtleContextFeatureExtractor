Psalms.
Chapter 88.
“A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the leader of the music. Upon wind instruments. A psalm of Heman, the Ezrahite.” O LORD, God of my salvation! To thee do I cry by day, And by night is my prayer before thee! 
Let my supplication come before thee; Incline thine ear to my cry! 
For my soul is full of misery, And my life draweth near to the underworld. 
I am counted with those who are going down to the pit; I am like one who hath no strength. 
I am left to myself among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom thou no more rememberest, And who are cut off from thy protecting hand. 
Thou hast placed me in a deep pit, In a dark and deep abyss. 
Thy wrath presseth hard upon me, And thou afflictest me with all thy waves! Pause. 
Thou hast put mine acquaintances far from me, Yea, thou hast made me their abhorrence: I am shut up, and cannot go forth. 
Mine eyes languish by reason of my affliction. I call upon thee daily, O LORD! To thee do I stretch out my hands! 
Canst thou show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise, and praise thee? Pause. 
Shall thy goodness be declared in the grave, Or thy faithfulness in the place of corruption? 
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark, And thy justice in the land of forgetfulness? 
To thee do I cry, O LORD! In the morning doth my cry come before thee. 
Why, O LORD! dost thou cast me off? Why hidest thou thy face from me? 
I have been afflicted and languishing from my youth; I suffer thy terrors, and am distracted. 
Thy fierce wrath overwhelmeth me; Thy terrors utterly destroy me. 
They surround me daily like water; They compass me about together. 
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me; My acquaintances are withdrawn from my sight.
