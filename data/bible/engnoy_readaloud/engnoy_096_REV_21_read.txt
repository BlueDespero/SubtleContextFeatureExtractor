Revelation.
Chapter 21.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. 
And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them, their God; 
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall mourning, nor crying, nor pain he any more; for the former things are passed away. 
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write; for these words are faithful and true. 
And he said to me, All things are accomplished. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely. 
He that overcometh shall inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. 
But the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the polluted with abominations, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death. 
And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials filled with the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb. 
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
having the glory of God; her light was like to a most precious stone, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal; 
having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel; 
on the east, three gates; and on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates. 
And the wall of the city had twelve foundation-stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
And he who talked with me had for a measure a golden reed, to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. 
And the city lieth four-square, and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. 
And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to a man's measure, which is that of an angel. 
And the material of its wall was jasper; and the city was of pure gold, like to clear glass. 
The foundation-stones of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones: the first foundation-stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. 
And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb. 
And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine upon it; for the glory of God lightened it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 
And the nations will walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it; 
and the gates of it shall not be shut by day, for there will be no night there; 
and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 
And there shall not enter into it anything unclean, or that worketh abomination and falsehood; but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life.
