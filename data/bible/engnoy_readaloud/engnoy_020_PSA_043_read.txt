Psalms.
Chapter 43.
Judge me, O God! and defend my cause against a merciless nation! Deliver me from unjust and deceitful men! 
Thou art the God of my refuge: why dost thou cast me off? Why go I mourning on account of the oppression of the enemy? 
O send forth thy light and thy truth; let them guide me; Let them lead me to thy holy mountain, and to thy dwelling-place! 
Then will I go to the altar of God, To the God of my joy and exultation; Yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God! 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!
