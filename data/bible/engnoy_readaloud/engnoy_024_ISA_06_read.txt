Isaiah.
Chapter 6.
In the year in which King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up, and the train of his robe filled the temple. 
Around him stood seraphs; each one of them had six wings; with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly. 
And one called to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; The whole earth is full of his glory. 
And the foundations of the thresholds were shaken with the voice of their cry. And the temple was filled with smoke. 
Then I said, Alas for me! I am undone! For I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell among a people of unclean lips, and mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts. 
Then flew one of the seraphs to me, having in his hands a glowing stone, which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. 
And he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this toucheth thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is expiated. 
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said: Behold, here am I; send me! 
And he said: Go, and say thou to this people, Hear ye, indeed, but understand not; See ye, indeed, but perceive not! 
Make the heart of this people gross; Make their ears dull, and blind their eyes; That they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, Nor perceive with their hearts, and turn, and be healed. 
Then said I, How long, Lord? He said: Until the cities be laid waste, so that there be no inhabitant, And the houses, so that there be no man, And the land be left utterly desolate; 
Until Jehovah have removed the men far away, And there be great desolation in the land. 
And though there be a tenth part remaining in it, Even this shall again be destroyed; Yet as when the terebinth and the oak are cut down, Their stem remaineth alive, So shall a holy race be the stem of the nation.
