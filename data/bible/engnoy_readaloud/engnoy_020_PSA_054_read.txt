Psalms.
Chapter 54.
“For the leader of the music. To be sung on stringed instruments A psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?” Save me, O God! by thy name, And by thy strength defend my cause! 
O God! hear my prayer, Give ear to the words of my mouth! 
For enemies have risen up against me, And oppressors seek my life; They have not set God before their eyes. Pause. 
Behold! God is my helper; The Lord is the support of my life. 
He will repay evil to my enemies; For thy truth's sake, O God! cut them off! 
With a willing heart will I sacrifice to thee; I will praise thy name, O LORD! for it is good; 
For thou hast delivered me from all trouble, So that my eye hath looked with joy upon my enemies!
