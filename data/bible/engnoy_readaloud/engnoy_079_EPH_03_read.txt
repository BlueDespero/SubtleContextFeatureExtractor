Ephesians.
Chapter 3.
For this cause I bend my knees, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you gentiles; 
if, indeed, ye heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given me toward you, 
that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words, 
whereby, when ye read, ye may perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ; 
which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 
that the gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers with us of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel; 
of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, given to me according to the effectual working of his power. 
To me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to make known among the gentiles the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of Christ, 
to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery, which hath been hidden for ages in God, who created all things; 
to the intent that now to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions might be known through the church the manifold wisdom of God, 
according to his purpose for ages, which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord; 
in whom we have our boldness and our access in confidence, through faith in him. 
Wherefore I entreat you not to be disheartened by the troubles I am suffering for you, since they are your glory. 
For this cause I bend my knees to the Father, 
from whom every family in heaven and on earth receiveth its name, 
that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 
that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, ye having been rooted and grounded in love, 
that ye may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, 
and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fullness of God. 
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
to him be the glory in the church in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
