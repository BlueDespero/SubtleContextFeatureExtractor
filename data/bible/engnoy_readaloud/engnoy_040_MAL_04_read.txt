Malachi.
Chapter 4.
For, behold, the day cometh, which shall burn as an oven; Then shall all the proud, And all that do wickedness, be stubble; And the day that cometh shall burn them up, Saith Jehovah of hosts; It shall leave them neither root nor branch. 
But for you that fear my name Shall the sun of salvation arise With healing under his wings. And ye shall go forth and leap for joy, Like calves of the stall. 
And ye shall tread down the wicked; For they shall be as dust under the soles of your feet In the day which I appoint, saith Jehovah of hosts. 
Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, Which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, My statutes and precepts! 
Behold, I will send you Elijah, the prophet, Before the day of Jehovah come, The great and terrible day. 
He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, And the heart of the children to their fathers, That I may not come And smite the land with a curse.
