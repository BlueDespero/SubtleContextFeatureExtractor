2 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come. 
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without 
natural affection, implacable, slanderers, incontinent, fierce, without love for what is good, 
betrayers, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; 
having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. And from these turn away. 
For of these are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, 
ever learning, and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth. 
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also do these withstand the truth; men corrupted in their minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
But they will proceed no further; for their folly will be clearly manifest to all, as that of those men was. 
But thou art well acquainted with my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience, 
persecutions, sufferings; what things came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 
Yea, and all that desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 
But evil men and impostors will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
But do thou continue in the things which thou didst learn and wast assured of, knowing from what teachers thou didst learn them, 
and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
All Scripture is inspired by God, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for discipline in righteousness; 
that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.
