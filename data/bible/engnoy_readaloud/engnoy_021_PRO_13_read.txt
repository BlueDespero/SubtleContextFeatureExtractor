Proverbs.
Chapter 13.
A wise son listeneth to the instruction of his father; But a scoffer listeneth not to rebuke. 
By the fruit of a man's mouth he shall eat good; But the appetite of transgressors shall be sated with violence. 
He who keepeth his mouth keepeth his life; But destruction shall be to him who openeth wide his lips. 
The appetite of the sluggard longeth, and hath nothing; But the appetite of the diligent is fully satisfied. 
A righteous man hateth words of falsehood; But a wicked man causeth disgrace and shame. 
Righteousness preserveth him who is upright in his way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner. 
There is who maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing, Who maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches. 
A man's wealth is the ransom of his life; But the poor man heareth no threatenings. 
The light of the righteous shall rejoice; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 
By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom. 
Wealth gotten by vanity will become small; But he who gathereth it into the hand increaseth it. 
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But the desire accomplished is a tree of life. 
He that despiseth the word shall be destroyed; But he who revereth the commandment shall be rewarded. 
The instruction of the wise is a fountain of life; By it men escape from the snares of death. 
A good understanding winneth favor; But the way of transgressors is hard. 
Every prudent man acteth with knowledge; But a fool spreadeth abroad his folly. 
A wicked messenger falleth into trouble; But a faithful ambassador is health. 
Poverty and shame are for him who rejecteth instruction; But he that regardeth reproof shall come to honor. 
The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil. 
He who walketh with wise men shall be wise; But the companion of fools shall be destroyed. 
Calamity pursueth the wicked; But the righteous is rewarded with good. 
The good man leaveth his substance to his children's children; But the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. 
There is much food from the fallow-ground of the poor; But there is who is brought low for want of uprightness. 
He that spareth the rod hateth his son; But he who loveth him chasteneth him early. 
The righteous man eateth to the satisfying of his desire; But the stomach of the wicked suffereth want.
