1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
I exhort then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; 
for kings, and all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and propriety. 
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, 
whose will is that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. 
For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
who gave himself a ransom for all; to which the testimony was to be borne in its own due times, 
whereunto I was appointed a herald and an apostle, (I speak the truth, I lie not,) a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth. 
I desire, then, that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 
In like manner also, that women, in seemly attire, adorn themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair, and gold, or pearls, or costly apparel; 
but, as becometh women professing godliness, with good works. 
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 
But I suffer not the woman to teach, nor to have authority over the man, but to be in silence. 
For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 
And Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived fell into transgression. 
But she will be saved through child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety.
