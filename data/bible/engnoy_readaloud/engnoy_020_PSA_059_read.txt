Psalms.
Chapter 59.
“For the leader of the music. To the tune of “Do not destroy.” A psalm of David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.” Deliver me from my enemies, O my God! Defend me from them that rise up against me! 
Deliver me from the doers of iniquity, And save me from men of blood! 
For, lo! they lie in wait for my life; The mighty are gathered against me, Without any offence or fault of mine, O LORD! 
Without any offence of mine, they run and prepare themselves; Awake to help me, and behold! 
Do thou, O Jehovah, God of hosts, God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations! Show no mercy to any wicked transgressors! Pause. 
Let them return at evening, Let them howl like dogs, And go round about the city! 
Behold! with their mouths they belch out malice; Swords are upon their lips; “For who,” say they, “will hear?” 
Yet thou, O LORD! wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt hold all the nations in derision! 
O my Strength! to thee will I look! For God is my defence; 
My God will come to meet me with his mercy; God will cause me to look with joy upon my enemies. 
Slay them not, lest my people forget; Scatter them by thy power, and cast them down, O Lord, our shield! 
The word of their lips is the sin of their mouth; Let them be overtaken in their pride, For the curses and the falsehood which they utter! 
Consume them in thy wrath; consume them that they be no more, That they may know that God ruleth in Jacob, Even to the ends of the earth! Pause. 
Let them return at evening, Let them howl like dogs, And go round about the city! 
Let them wander about for food, When they have passed the night unsatisfied! 
But I will sing of thy power; Yea, in the morning will I sing aloud of thy mercy; For thou hast been my defence, My refuge in the day of my distress. 
To thee, O my Strength! will I sing! For God is my defence; a God of mercy to me.
