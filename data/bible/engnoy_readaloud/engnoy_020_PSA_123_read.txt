Psalms.
Chapter 123.
“A song of the steps, or the goings up.” To thee do I lift up mine eyes, O Thou who dwellest in the heavens! 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, And as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress, So do our eyes look to the LORD, our God, Until he have pity upon us. 
Have mercy upon us, O LORD! have mercy upon us, For we are overwhelmed with contempt! 
Our soul is filled to the full with the scorn of those who are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.
