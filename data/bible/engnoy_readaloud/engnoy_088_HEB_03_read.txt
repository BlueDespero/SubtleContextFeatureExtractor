Hebrews.
Chapter 3.
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high-priest of our profession, Jesus; 
who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house. 
For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as greater than the house is he who built it. 
For every house is builded by some one; but he who built all things is God. 
And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, that he might testify of those things which were to be spoken; 
but Christ as a son over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and joyousness of our hope. 
Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit saith: “To-day, if ye hear his voice, 
harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 
where your fathers tempted me by proving me, and saw my works forty years. 
Wherefore I was offended with that generation, and said, They always err in their heart, but they knew not my ways; 
so I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.” 
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you may be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast our first confidence firm to the end. 
When it is said, “To-day, if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,” 
who then, when they had heard, provoked? Was it not all who came out of Egypt by means of Moses? 
And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 
And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, except to those who were disobedient? 
So then we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
