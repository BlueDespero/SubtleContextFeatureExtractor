2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, as with you, 
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for it is not all that have faith. 
But faithful is the Lord, who will establish you, and guard you from evil. 
And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you. 
And the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to perseverance in the cause of Christ. 
Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us. 
For ye yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you, 
neither did we eat any man's bread for nought, but were working with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be burdensome to any of you. 
Not because we have not authority, but to make ourselves an example to you, that ye should imitate us. 
For also when we were with you, this we commanded you: If any one will not work, neither let him eat. 
For we hear of some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. 
Now such we charge and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread. 
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing. 
And if any one obey not our word by this epistle, mark that man; and keep no company with him, that he may be shamed; 
yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way; the Lord be with you all. 
The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; which is the token in every letter; so I write. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
