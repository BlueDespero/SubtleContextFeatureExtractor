Psalms.
Chapter 111.
Praise ye the LORD! I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, In the assembly of the righteous, and in the congregation. 
The works of the LORD are great, Sought out by all who have pleasure in them. 
His deeds are honorable and glorious, And his righteousness endureth for ever. 
He hath established a memorial of his wonders; The LORD is gracious and full of compassion. 
He giveth meat to them that fear him; He is ever mindful of his covenant. 
He showed his people the greatness of his works, When he gave them the inheritance of the heathen. 
The deeds of his hands are truth and justice; All his commandments are sure; 
They stand firm for ever and ever, Being founded in truth and justice. 
He sent redemption to his people; He established his covenant for ever; Holy, and to be had in reverence, is his name. 
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they who keep his commandments; His praise endureth for ever.
