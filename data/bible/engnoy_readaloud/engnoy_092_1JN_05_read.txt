1 John.
Chapter 5.
Whoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ hath been born of God; and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth also him that hath been begotten of him. 
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and do his commandments. 
For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not burdensome, 
because whatever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith. 
Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 
This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is that which beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 
For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one. 
If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son. 
He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness within him; he that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he hath not believed in the witness which God hath borne concerning his Son. 
And this is the witness, that God gave to us everlasting life, and this life is in his Son. 
He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life. 
These things have I written to you, that ye may know that ye who believe in the name of the Son of God have everlasting life. 
And this is the confidence which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us; 
and if we know that he heareth us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked of him. 
If any one see his brother sin a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and shall give him life,—to those who sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death; for that I do not say that he shall pray. 
All unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not unto death. 
We know that whoever hath been born of God sinneth not; but he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the Evil One toucheth him not. 
We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth under the dominion of the Evil One. 
And we know that the Son of God hath come, and hath given us understanding, that we may know the True One; and we are in the True One, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and everlasting life. 
My children, keep yourselves from idols.
