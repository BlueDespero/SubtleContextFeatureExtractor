Song of Solomon.
Chapter 7.
Lov. How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy hips are like neck ornaments, The work of the hands of the artificer; 
Thy navel is like a round goblet, that wanteth not the spiced wine; Thy belly like a heap of wheat, inclosed with lilies; 
Thy two breasts are like two young twin gazelles; 
Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes are like the pools at Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus; 
Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is captivated by thy locks. 
How fair, how pleasant art thou, love, in delights! 
This thy stature is like the palm-tree, And thy breasts like clusters of dates. 
I will go up, say I to myself, upon the palm-tree; I will take hold of its boughs, And thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples, 
And thy mouth like the best wine— M. — that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Flowing over the lips of them that sleep. 
I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me. 
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the country; Let us lodge in the villages! 
Then will we go early to the vineyards, To see whether the vine putteth forth, Whether its blossom openeth, And the pomegranates bud forth; There will I give thee my love! 
The love-apples give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old: I have kept them for thee, my beloved!
