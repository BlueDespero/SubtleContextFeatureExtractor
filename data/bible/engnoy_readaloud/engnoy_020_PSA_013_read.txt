Psalms.
Chapter 13.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” How long, O LORD! wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
How long shall I have anxiety in my soul for ever, And sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
Look down and hear me, O LORD, my God! Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 
Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him!” Lest my adversaries rejoice, when I am fallen. 
Yet will I trust in thy goodness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation; 
I will sing to the LORD, that he hath dealt kindly with me.
