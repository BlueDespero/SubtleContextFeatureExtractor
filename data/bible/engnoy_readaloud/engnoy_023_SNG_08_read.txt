Song of Solomon.
Chapter 8.
O that thou wert as my brother, That sucked the breast of my mother! When I found thee abroad, I might kiss thee; And for it no one would deride me. 
I will lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, that thou mayst teach me; I will give thee spiced wine to drink, and the juice of my pomegranates. 
His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraceth me. 
Lov. I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem! That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, Till she please! 
Lad. Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? M. Under the apple-tree I awakened thee; There thy mother brought thee forth; There she that bore thee brought thee forth! 
O set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm! For love is strong as death; True love is firm as the grave: Its flames are flames of fire, The fire of Jehovah. 
Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can floods drown it. Would a man give all the wealth of his house for love, It would be utterly contemned. 
Br. We have a sister who is yet young; She is yet without breasts. What shall we do with our sister, When she shall be spoken for? 
If she be a wall, We will build upon it a silver tower; If she be an open gate, We will inclose her with planks of cedar. 
Sis. I am a wall, and my breasts like towers; Therefore am I become in his eyes as one that findeth peace. 
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard to keepers; Every one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. 
My vineyard is before my eyes. Be thine the thousand, O Solomon! And two hundred to the keepers of its fruit! 
Lov. Thou that dwellest in the gardens! Friends listen to thy voice; Let me hear thee! 
Fly, my beloved! like a gazelle, or a young hind, Upon the mountains of spices.
