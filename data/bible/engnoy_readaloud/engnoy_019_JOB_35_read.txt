Job.
Chapter 35.
Moreover Elihu proceeded, and said: 
Dost thou then think this to be right? Thou hast said, “I am more righteous than God.” 
For thou askest, “What advantage have I? What have I gained, more than if I had sinned?” 
I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee. 
Look up to the heavens, and see! And behold the clouds, which are high above thee! 
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against Him? If thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou to him? 
If thou art righteous, what dost thou give him? Or what receiveth he at thy hand? 
Thy wickedness injureth only a man like thyself, And thy righteousness profiteth only a son of man. 
The oppressed cry out on account of the multitude of wrongs; They cry aloud on account of the arm of the mighty. 
But none saith, “Where is God, my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night; 
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of heaven?” 
There they cry aloud on account of the pride of the wicked; But he giveth no answer. 
For God will not hear the vain supplication, Nor will the Almighty regard it; 
Much less when thou sayest thou canst not see him: Justice is with him,—only wait thou for him! 
But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Nor taken strict note of transgression, 
Therefore hath Job opened his mouth rashly, And multiplied words without knowledge.
