Job.
Chapter 18.
Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 
How long ere ye make an end of words? Understand, and then we will speak! 
Why are we accounted as brutes, And reputed vile in your sight? 
Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger! Must the earth be deserted for thee, And the rock removed from its place? 
Behold, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the flame of his fire shall not shine. 
Light shall become darkness in his tent, And his lamp over him shall go out. 
His strong steps shall be straitened, And his own plans shall cast him down. 
He is brought into the net by his own feet, And he walketh upon snares. 
The trap layeth hold of him by the heel, And the snare holdeth him fast. 
A net is secretly laid for him on the ground, And a trap for him in the pathway. 
Terrors affright him on every side, And harass him at his heels. 
His strength is wasted by hunger, And destruction is ready at his side. 
His limbs are consumed, Yea, his limbs are devoured by the first-born of death. 
He is torn from his tent, which was his confidence, And is borne away to the king of terrors. 
They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent; Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
His roots below shall be dried up, And his branches above shall be withered. 
His memory perisheth from the earth, And no name hath he in the land. 
He shall be thrust from light into darkness, And driven out of the world. 
He hath no son, nor kinsman among his people, Nor any survivor in his dwelling-place. 
They that come after him shall be amazed at his fate, As they that were before them were struck with horror. 
Yea, such is the dwelling of the unrighteous man; Such is the place of him who knoweth not God!
