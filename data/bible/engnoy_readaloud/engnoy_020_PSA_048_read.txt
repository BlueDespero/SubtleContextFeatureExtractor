Psalms.
Chapter 48.
“A psalm of the sons of Korah.” Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, upon his holy mountain. 
Beautiful in its elevation is Mount Zion, The joy of the whole earth; The joy of the farthest North is the city of the great king; 
In her palaces God is known as a refuge. 
For, lo! kings were assembled against it; They passed away together. 
As soon as they saw, they were astonished; They were confounded, and hasted away. 
There terror seized upon them,—Pain, as of a woman in travail; 
As when the east wind breaketh in pieces The ships of Tarshish. 
As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it for ever. Pause. 
We think of thy loving-kindness, O God! In the midst of thy temple! 
As thy name, O God! so thy praise, extendeth to the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
Mount Zion rejoiceth, The daughters of Judah exult, On account of thy righteous judgments. 
Go round about Zion; number her towers; 
Mark well her bulwarks; count her palaces; That ye may tell it to the next generation! 
For this God is our God for ever and ever; He will be our guide unto death.
