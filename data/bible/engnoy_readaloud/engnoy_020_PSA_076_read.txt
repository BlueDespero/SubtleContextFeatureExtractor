Psalms.
Chapter 76.
“For the leader of the music. Upon stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph.” In Judah is God known; Great is his name in Israel. 
In Jerusalem is his tabernacle, And in Zion his dwelling-place. 
There brake he the lightning of the bow, The shield, the sword, and all the weapons of battle. 
More glorious and excellent art thou Than those mountains of robbers! 
Spoiled are the stout-hearted; They sank into their sleep; The hands of the mighty were powerless. 
Before thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! Fell chariot and horseman into a deep sleep! 
Thou, thou, O God! art terrible! Who can stand before thee in thine anger? 
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth trembled and was still, 
When God arose to judgment, To save all the oppressed of the earth! 
The wrath of man shall praise thee, When thou girdest on the whole of thy wrath! 
Make and perform vows to Jehovah, your God! Let all that dwell around him bring gifts to the terrible One, 
Who casteth down the pride of princes, Who is terrible to the kings of the earth!
