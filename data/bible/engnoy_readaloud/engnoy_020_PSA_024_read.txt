Psalms.
Chapter 24.
“A psalm of David.” The earth is the LORD'S, and all that is therein; The world, and they who inhabit it. 
For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods. 
Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place? 
He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; Who hath not inclined his soul to falsehood, Nor sworn deceitfully. 
He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, And favor from the God of his salvation. 
This is the race of them that seek him; They that seek thy face are Jacob. Pause. 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, That the king of glory may come in! 
“Who is this king of glory?” Jehovah, strong and mighty; Jehovah, mighty in battle. 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates! Lift yourselves up, ye everlasting doors, That the king of glory may enter in! 
“Who is this king of glory?” Jehovah, God of hosts, he is the king of glory. Pause.
