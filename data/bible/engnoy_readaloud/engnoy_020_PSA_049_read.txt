Psalms.
Chapter 49.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” Hear this, all ye nations; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world; 
Both high and low, rich and poor alike! 
My mouth shall speak wisdom, And the meditation of my mind shall be understanding. 
I will incline mine ear to a poem; I will utter my song upon the harp. 
Why should I fear in the days of adversity, When the iniquity of my adversaries encompasseth me; 
They who trust in their riches, And glory in the greatness of their wealth? 
No one can redeem his brother from death, Nor give a ransom for him to God, 
That he should live to eternity, And not see the pit. 
Too costly is the redemption of his life, And he giveth it up for ever. 
For he seeth that wise men die, As well as the foolish and the ignorant; They perish alike, And leave their wealth to others. 
They imagine that their houses will endure for ever, And their dwelling-places from generation to generation: Men celebrate their names on the earth. 
Yet man, who is in honor, abideth not; He is like the beasts that perish. 
Such is the way which is their confidence! And they who come after them approve their maxims. Pause. 
Like sheep they are cast into the underworld; Death shall feed upon them; And the upright shall soon trample upon them. Their form shall be consumed in the underworld, And they shall no more have a dwelling-place. 
But God will redeem my life from the underworld; Yea, he will take me under his care. Pause. 
Be not thou afraid, when one becometh rich; When the glory of his house is increased! 
For, when he dieth, he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him. 
Though in his life he thought himself happy,—Though men praised thee, while thou wast in prosperity,— 
Yet shalt thou go to the dwelling-place of thy fathers, Who never more shall see the light! 
The man who is in honor, but without understanding, Is like the beasts that perish.
