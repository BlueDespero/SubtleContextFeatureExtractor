Psalms.
Chapter 9.
“For the leader of the music; to be sung in the manner or with the voice of maidens. To the Benites, or to Ben. A psalm of David.” I will praise thee, O LORD! with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works. 
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High! 
All my enemies are turned back; They fall and perish at thy presence. 
For thou dost defend my right and my cause; Thou sittest upon the throne, a righteous judge. 
Thou rebukest the nations; Thou destroyest the wicked; Thou blottest out their name for evermore! 
The enemy is fallen,—a desolation for ever! Thou, O LORD! hast destroyed their cities; Their memory itself hath perished! 
The LORD reigneth for ever; He hath prepared his throne for judgment. 
He judgeth the world in righteousness; He administereth judgment to the nations with uprightness. 
Yea, the LORD is a refuge for the oppressed; A refuge in times of trouble. 
They who know thy name put their trust in thee; For thou, O LORD! forsakest not them that seek thee! 
Sing praises to the LORD, who reigneth in Zion; Declare his doings among the people! 
As the avenger of blood, he remembereth the distressed; He forgetteth not their complaint. 
“Have pity upon me, said I, O LORD! Look upon my affliction through them that hate me; Lift me up from the gates of death: 
That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion; That I may rejoice in salvation by thee.” 
The nations have sunk into the pit which they made; In the net, which they hid, is their own foot taken. 
Thus it is known that the LORD executeth judgment; The wicked are ensnared in the work of their own hands. Stringed instruments. Pause. 
The wicked shall be driven into the underworld; Yea, all the nations that forger God. 
For the poor shall not always be forgotten; The hopes of the afflicted shall not perish for ever. 
Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; Let the nations be judged by thee! 
Strike terror into them, O LORD! Let the nations know that they are but men! Pause.
