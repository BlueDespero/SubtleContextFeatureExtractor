Psalms.
Chapter 62.
“For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites, A psalm of David.” Truly my soul resteth on God alone; From him cometh my deliverance! 
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my safeguard, I shall not wholly fall! 
How long will ye continue to assault a single man? How long will ye all seek to destroy me, Like a bending wall, or a tottering fence? 
They study how to cast me down from my eminence; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse. 
My soul, rest thou on God alone, For from him cometh my hope! 
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my safeguard, —I shall not fall. 
From God cometh my help and my glory: My strong rock, my refuge, is God. 
Trust in him at all times, ye people! Pour out your hearts before him! God is our refuge! 
Truly men of low degree are vanity, And men of high degree are a lie; Placed in the balance, They are all lighter than vanity. 
Trust not in extortion; Place no vain hopes in rapine! If riches increase, set not your heart upon them! 
Once hath God promised, twice have I heard it, That power belongeth unto God. 
To thee also, O Lord! belongeth mercy; For thou dost render to every man according to his work!
