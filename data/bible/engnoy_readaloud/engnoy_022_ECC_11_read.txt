Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 11.
Cast thy bread upon the waters; for after many days thou shalt find it. 
Give a portion to seven, yea, to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 
When the clouds are full of rain, they empty upon the earth; and when a tree falleth to the south or the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. 
He that watcheth the wind will not sow, and he that gazeth upon the clouds will not reap. 
As thou knowest not the way of the wind, nor how the bones are formed in the womb of her that is with child, so thou canst not know the work of God, who doeth all things. 
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand! For thou knowest not whether this shall prosper, or that, or whether both of them shall be alike good. 
Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. 
Yea, though a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and let him think of the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes! but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy body! for childhood and youth are vanity.
