Psalms.
Chapter 64.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” Hear my voice, O God! when I pray! Preserve my life from the terrors of the enemy! 
Hide me from the assembly of the wicked, From the brawling crowd of evil-doers! 
For like a sword they sharpen their tongues, Like arrows they aim their poisoned words, 
To shoot in secret at the upright; Suddenly do they shoot at him without fear. 
They prepare themselves for an evil deed; They commune of laying secret snares: “Who,” say they, “will see them?” 
They meditate crimes: “We have finished,” say they, “our plans!” The heart and bosom of every one of them are deep. 
But God will shoot an arrow at them; Suddenly shall they be wounded. 
Thus their own tongues shall bring them down; All who see them will flee away. 
Then will all men stand in awe, And declare what God hath done, And attentively consider his work. 
The righteous shall rejoice, and trust in the LORD; All the upright in heart shall glory.
