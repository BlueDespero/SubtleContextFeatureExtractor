Matthew.
Chapter 14.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
and said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him. 
For Herod had seized John, and bound him, and put him in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. 
For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 
And wishing to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet. 
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod; 
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. 
And she, being set on by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist. 
And the king was sorry; but on account of his oaths, and of those at table with him, he ordered it to be given, 
and sent and beheaded John in the prison. 
And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel; and she brought it to her mother. 
And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. 
When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew thence in a boat into a desert place apart; and the multitudes hearing of it followed him on foot from the cities. 
And when he came forth he saw a great multitude; and he was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick. 
And when it was evening, the disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and it is now late; send the multitudes away therefore, that they may go to the villages and buy themselves victuals. 
But he said to them, They need not go away; do ye give them food. 
And they say to him, We have here only five loaves, and two fishes. 
He said, Bring them hither to me. 
And bidding the multitudes to lie down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he blessed; and having broken the loaves he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. 
And they all ate, and were filled. And they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full. 
And they who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. 
and he constrained the disciples to get into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. 
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone. 
But the boat was now in the midst of the lake, tossed by the waves; for the wind was contrary. 
And in the fourth watch of the night, he went to them, walking on the lake. 
And seeing him walking on the lake, they were dismayed, saying, It is a spectre; and they cried out for fear. 
But he immediately spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid. 
And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water. 
And he said, Come. And Peter, coming down from the boat, walked on the water, and came to Jesus. 
But seeing the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me! 
And Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him, Thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt? 
And when they had got into the boat, the wind ceased. 
And they that were in the boat fell down before him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God. 
And crossing over, they came to land, to Gennesaret. 
And the men of that place, when they saw who he was, sent out into all that country round, and brought to him all the diseased, 
and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched were made well.
