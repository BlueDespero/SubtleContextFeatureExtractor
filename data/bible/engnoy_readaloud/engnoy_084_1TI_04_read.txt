1 Timothy.
Chapter 4.
Now the Spirit saith expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons, 
through the hypocrisy of speakers of lies, who bear a brand on their own conscience, 
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from food which God created to be received with thanksgiving, for those who believe and know the truth. 
For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving; 
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 
If thou lay these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, with which thou art well acquainted. 
But avoid the profane and old wives' fables; and exercise thyself unto godliness. 
For bodily exercise is profitable for little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 
True is the saying, and worthy of all acceptance. 
For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of believers. 
These things command and teach. 
Let no one despise thy youth, but become an example to the believers, in word, in behavior, in love, in faith, in purity. 
Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. 
Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
Meditate on these things, give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest to all. 
Give heed to thyself, and to thy teaching; continue in them; for in doing this thou wilt save both thyself and them that hear thee.
