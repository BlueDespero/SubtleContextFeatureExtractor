Psalms.
Chapter 86.
“A prayer of David.” Incline thine ear, O LORD! and hear me, For I am poor and distressed! 
Preserve my life, for I am devoted to thee! Save, O thou my God! thy servant who trusteth in thee! 
Have pity upon me, O Lord! For to thee do I cry daily! 
Revive the soul of thy servant, For to thee, O Lord! do I lift up my soul! 
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; Yea, rich in mercy to all that call upon thee! 
Give ear, O LORD! to my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplication! 
In the day of my trouble I call upon thee, For thou dost answer me! 
Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord! And there are no works like thy works! 
All the nations which thou hast made must come and worship before thee, O Lord! And glorify thy name! 
For great art thou, and wondrous are thy works; Thou alone art God! 
Teach me, O LORD! thy way, That I may walk in thy truth; Unite all my heart to fear thy name! 
I will praise thee, O Lord, my God! with my whole heart; I will give glory to thy name for ever! 
For thy kindness to me hath been great; Thou hast delivered me from the depths of the underworld! 
O God! the proud have risen against me; Bands of cruel men seek my life, And set not thee before their eyes. 
But thou, O Lord! art a God full of compassion and kindness, Long-suffering, rich in mercy and truth! 
Look upon me, and have compassion upon me! Give thy strength to thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid! 
Show me a token for good, That my enemies may see it and be confounded; Because thou, O LORD! helpest and comfortest me!
