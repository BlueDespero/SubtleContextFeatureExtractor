Hosea.
Chapter 6.
“Come, and let us return to Jehovah! For he hath torn, and he will heal us; He hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
After two days will he revive us, On the third day he will raise us up, And we shall live in his presence, 
Let us, therefore, know him; Let us ever strive to know Jehovah, His coming forth is sure as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter rain which watereth the earth.” 
O Ephraim, what shall I do to thee? O Judah, what shall I do to thee? For your goodness is like the morning cloud, And like the early dew, which vanisheth away. 
Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth, And my judgments have gone forth like the light. 
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings. 
But they, after the manner of men, have transgressed the covenant; Even therein have they dealt unfaithfully with me. 
Gilead is a city of them that do iniquity; She is full of footsteps of blood. 
As troops of robbers lying in wait for a man, so is the company of priests; They murder in the way to Shechem; Yea, they commit heinous wickedness. 
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel; There Ephraim committeth fornication, Israel is polluted. 
For thee also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.
