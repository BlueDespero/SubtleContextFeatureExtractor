Psalms.
Chapter 133.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. By David.” Behold, how good and pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity! 
It is like precious perfume upon the head, Which ran down upon the beard, The beard of Aaron; Which went down to the very border of his garments; 
Like the dew of Hermon, Like that which descendeth upon the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD commandeth a blessing, Even life for evermore.
