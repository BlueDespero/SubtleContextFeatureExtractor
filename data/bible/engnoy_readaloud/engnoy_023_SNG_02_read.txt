Song of Solomon.
Chapter 2.
I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys. 
Lov. As the lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters. 
M. As the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the sons. In his shadow I love to sit down, And his fruit is sweet to my taste. 
He hath brought me to his banqueting-house, And his banner over me is love. Strengthen me with raisins, 
Refresh me with apples! For I am sick with love. 
His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraceth me! 
Lov. I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till she please! 
M. The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, Bounding upon the hills. 
Like a gazelle is my beloved, Or a young hind. Behold, he standeth behind our wall; He is looking through the windows; He glanceth through the lattice. 
My beloved speaketh, and saith to me, “Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away! 
For, lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone; 
The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing of birds is come, And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 
The fig-tree is spicing its green fruit; The vines in blossom give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away! 
O my dove, that art in the recesses of the rock, In the hiding-places of the steep craggy mountain, Let me see thy face, Let me hear thy voice! For sweet is thy voice, And thy face lovely.” 
Take ye for us the foxes, The little foxes that spoil the vines; For our vines are now in blossom. 
My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth among the lilies. 
When the day breathes, and the shadows flee away, Come again, my beloved, like a gazelle, or a young hind, Upon the craggy mountains.
