Psalms.
Chapter 145.
“A song of praise. By David.” I will extol thee, my God, the King! I will praise thy name for ever and ever! 
Every day will I bless thee, And praise thy name for ever and ever! 
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; Yea, his greatness is unsearchable. 
One generation shall praise thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty deeds. 
I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty, And of thy wonderful works. 
Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible deeds, And I will declare thy greatness; 
They shall pour forth the praise of thy great good And sing of thy righteousness. 
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion, Slow to anger, and rich in mercy. 
The LORD is good to all. And his tender mercies are over all his works. 
All thy works praise thee, O LORD! And thy holy ones bless thee! 
They speak of the glory of thy kingdom, And talk of thy power; 
To make known to the sons of men his mighty deeds, And the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. 
The LORD upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all that are bowed down. 
The eyes of all wait upon thee, And thou givest them their food in due season; 
Thou openest thine hand, And satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 
The LORD is righteous in all his ways, And merciful in all his works. 
The LORD is nigh to all that call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth. 
He fulfilleth the desire of them that fear him; He heareth their cry, and saveth them. 
The LORD preserveth all that love him; But all the wicked he will destroy. 
My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever!
