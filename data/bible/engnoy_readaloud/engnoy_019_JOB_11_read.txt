Job.
Chapter 11.
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said: 
Shall not the multitude of words receive an answer? Shall the man of words be justified? 
Shall thy boastings make men hold their peace? Shalt thou mock, and none put thee to shame? 
Thou sayest, My speech is pure; I am clean in thine eyes, O God! 
But O that God would speak, And open his lips against thee; 
That he would show thee the secrets of his wisdom,—His wisdom, which is unsearchable! Then shouldst thou know that God forgiveth thee many of thine iniquities. 
Canst thou search out the deep things of God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? 
'Tis high as heaven, what canst thou do? Deeper than hell, what canst thou know? 
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea. 
If he apprehend, and bind, and bring to trial, Who shall oppose him? 
For he knoweth the unrighteous; He seeth iniquity, when they do not observe it. 
But vain man is without understanding; Yea, man is born a wild ass's colt. 
If thou direct thy heart, And stretch out thy hands, toward him; 
If thou put away iniquity from thy hand, And let not wickedness dwell in thy habitation,— 
Then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and have no fear. 
For thou shalt forget thy misery, Or remember it as waters that have passed away. 
Thy life shall be brighter than the noon-day; Now thou art in darkness, thou shalt then be as morning. 
Thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Now thou art disappointed, thou shalt then rest in safety. 
Thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; And many shall make suit unto thee. 
But the eyes of the wicked shall be wearied out; They shall find no refuge; Their hope is—the breathing forth of life.
