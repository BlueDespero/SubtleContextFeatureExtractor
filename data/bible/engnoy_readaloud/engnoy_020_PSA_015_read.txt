Psalms.
Chapter 15.
“A psalm of David.” LORD, who shall abide at thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon thy holy hill? 
He that walketh uprightly, and doeth righteousness, And speaketh the truth from his heart; 
He that slandereth not with his tongue, That doeth no injury to his neighbor, And uttereth no reproach against his neighbor; 
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; But who honoreth them that fear the LORD; Who sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not; 
He that lendeth not his money for interest, And taketh not a bribe against the innocent: He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
