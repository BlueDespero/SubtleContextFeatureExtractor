2 Peter.
Chapter 2.
But there arose false prophets also among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will stealthily bring in destructive factions, even denying the Lord that bought them; bringing upon themselves swift destruction. 
And many will follow their dissolute ways, by reason of whom the way of truth will be evil spoken of; 
and in covetousness will they with feigned words make merchandise of you; for whom the judgment long ago ordained lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not. 
For if God spared not angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them over to chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 
and spared not the old world, but saved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
and turning into ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemned them to overthrow, making them an example for those who in after time should live ungodly; 
and delivered righteous Lot, distressed by the lewd conduct of the lawless men; 
(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds;) 
the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unrighteous under punishment to the day of judgment; 
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise dominion. Presumptuous, self-willed, they are not afraid to rail at dignities; 
whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, bring not against them a railing accusation; 
but these, as brute beasts, by nature born to be taken and destroyed, railing at things which they understand not, shall even perish in their own corruption, 
receiving the wages of unrighteousness. Counting it pleasure to riot in the day-time, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits while they feast with you, 
having eyes full of an adulteress, and that cannot cease from sin, alluring unstable souls, having a heart exercised in covetousness, children of a curse, 
they have forsaken the right way, and have gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, 
but was rebuked for his iniquity; the dumb ass, speaking with man's voice, restrained the madness of the prophet. 
These are wells without water, and mists driven by a tempest; for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved. 
For speaking great swelling words of vanity, they allure in the lusts of the flesh, by dissolute ways, such as were in some measure escaping from those who live in error; 
promising them liberty, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by the same is he also brought into bondage. 
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is worse with them than the first. 
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. 
It hath happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog returned to his own vomit; and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.
