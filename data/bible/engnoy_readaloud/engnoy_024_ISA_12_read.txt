Isaiah.
Chapter 12.
In that day shalt thou say, “I will praise thee, O Jehovah, for, though thou hast been angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me. 
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; For Jehovah is my glory, and my song; It is he who was my salvation.” 
Ye shall draw waters with joy from the fountains of salvation; 
And in that day ye shall say, “Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon his name; Make known his deeds among the people; Give praises, for his name is exalted! 
Sing to Jehovah, for he hath done glorious things; Be this known in all the earth! 
Cry aloud, shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee!”
