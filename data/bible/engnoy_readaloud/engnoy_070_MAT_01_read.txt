THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW.
Chapter 1.
The genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham. 
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers. 
And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah, by Tamar. And Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 
and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 
and Salmon begat Boaz by Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed by Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse; 
and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon by the wife of Uriah. 
And Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; 
and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; 
and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; 
and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; 
and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the removal to Babylon. 
And after the removal to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; 
and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 
and Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 
and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the removal to Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. 
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. 
Then Joseph her husband, being righteous, and not willing to expose her to shame, purposed to put her away privately. 
But while he thought on these things, lo! an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. 
And she will bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins. 
Now all this took place, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel;” that is, when interpreted, God-is with-us. 
Then Joseph, on waking up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife; 
and he knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name Jesus.
