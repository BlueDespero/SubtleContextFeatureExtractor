Psalms.
Chapter 57.
“For the leader of the music. To be sung to the tune of “Do not destroy.” A psalm of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.” Have pity upon me, O God! have pity upon me, For in thee doth my soul seek refuge! Yea, in the shadow of thy wings do I take shelter, Until these calamities be overpast! 
I call upon God the Most High, Upon God, who performeth all things for me; 
He will send from heaven, and save me; He will put to shame him that panteth for my life; Pause. God will send forth his mercy and his truth. 
My life is in the midst of lions; I dwell among them that breathe out fire; Among men whose teeth are spears and arrows, And whose tongue is a sharp sword. 
Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth! 
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have digged a pit before me, But into it they have themselves fallen. 
My heart is strengthened, O God! my heart is strengthened! I will sing, and give thanks. 
Awake, my soul! awake, psaltery and harp! I will wake with the early dawn. 
I will praise thee, O Lord! among the nations; I will sing to thee among the kingdoms! 
For thy mercy reacheth to the heavens, And thy truth to the clouds! 
Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth!
