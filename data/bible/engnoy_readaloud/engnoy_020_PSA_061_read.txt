Psalms.
Chapter 61.
“For the leader of the music. To be sung upon stringed instruments. A psalm of David.” Hear my cry, O God! Attend to my prayer! 
From the extremity of the land I cry unto thee in deep sorrow of heart; Lead me to the rock that is high above me! 
For thou art my refuge, My strong tower against the enemy. 
I shall dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will seek refuge under the covert of thy wings. 
For thou, O God! wilt hear my vows, And give me the inheritance of those who fear thy name. 
O prolong the life of the king! May his years extend through many generations! 
May he reign for ever before God! Grant that mercy and truth may preserve him! 
So will I sing praise to thy name for ever; I will daily perform my vows.
