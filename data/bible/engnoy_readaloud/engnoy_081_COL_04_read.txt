Colossians.
Chapter 4.
Masters, deal out to your bond-servants justice and equity, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven. 
Persevere in prayer, being watchful therein with thanksgiving; 
praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for the sake of which I am also in bonds; 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, buying up opportunities. 
Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every one. 
Of all my affairs Tychicus will inform you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord; 
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he may know your condition, and comfort your hearts; 
together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will inform you of every thing here. 
Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom ye received directions (if he come to you, receive him), 
and Jesus, who is called Justus; who are of the circumcision; these only are my fellow-workers for the kingdom of God, who have been an encouragement unto me. 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. 
For I bear him witness, that he hath much labor for you, and those that are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis. 
Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, salute you. 
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house. 
And when the letter hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the letter from Laodicea. 
And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it. 
The salutation by the hand of me, Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
