Proverbs.
Chapter 9.
Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars. 
She hath killed her fatlings; She hath mingled her wine; Yea, she hath furnished her table. 
She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth aloud upon the highest places of the city: 
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither!” To him that is void of understanding she saith, 
“Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled! 
Forsake folly, and live! And go forward in the way of understanding! 
“He who correcteth a scoffer Bringeth shame upon himself; And he who rebuketh the wicked Bringeth upon himself a stain. 
Rebuke not a scoffer, lest he hate thee; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; Teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning. 
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Most Holy is understanding. 
Yea, through me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased. 
If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou art a scoffer, thou alone must bear it.” 
The foolish woman is clamorous; She is very simple, and careth for nothing. 
She sitteth at the door of her house, Upon a seat in the high places of the city, 
To call aloud to those that pass by, Who go straight forward in their ways, 
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither!” And to him that is void of understanding she saith, 
“Stolen water is sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.” 
But he considereth not that the dead are there, That in the vales of the under-world are her guests.
