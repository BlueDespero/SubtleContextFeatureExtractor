Isaiah.
Chapter 15.
The prophecy concerning Moab. Yea! in the night of assault was Ar of Moab a ruin! In the night of assault was Kir of Moab a ruin! 
They go up to the temple, and to Dibon, to weep upon the high places; Upon Nebo and upon Medeba doth Moab howl; On every head is baldness, And every beard is shorn. 
In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; On the tops of their houses and in their public walks every one howleth, And melteth away with weeping. 
Heshbon and Elealah utter a cry; Even to Jahaz is their voice heard; Therefore the warriors of Moab shriek aloud; Their hearts tremble within them. 
My heart crieth out for Moab, Whose fugitives wander to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishijah; For they ascend the heights of Luhith weeping, And in the way of Horonaim they raise the cry of destruction. 
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate; The grass is withered; the tender plant faileth; There is no green thing left. 
Wherefore the remnant of their substance and their wealth They shall carry to the brook of willows. 
For the cry encompasseth the borders of Moab; Even to Eglaim reacheth her wailing, To Beer-Elim her howling. 
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; For I bring new evils upon Dimon; Upon him that escapeth of Moab will I send a lion, Even upon him that remaineth in the land.
