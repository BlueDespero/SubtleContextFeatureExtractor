Hosea.
Chapter 12.
Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind; Every day he multiplieth falsehood and violence; They make a league with Assyria, And oil is carried into Egypt. 
Therefore Jehovah hath a controversy with Judah. And he will punish Jacob for his ways, And requite him according to his doings. 
In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his strength he contended with God; 
Yea, he contended with the angel, and prevailed; He wept, and made supplication to him. At Bethel he found him, And there he spake with us. 
And Jehovah, the God of hosts, Jehovah is his name. 
Therefore turn thou to thy God; Observe mercy and justice, And hope in thy God always! 
He is a Canaanite; in his hands are the balances of deceit; He loveth to oppress. 
Yet Ephraim saith, Lo, I have become rich; I have found myself substance; In all my earnings can be found no transgression in which there is guilt. 
Yet I, Jehovah, have been thy God from the land of Egypt; I will again cause thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. 
I have also spoken to the prophets, And I have given many visions, And by the prophets I have used similitudes. 
Behold, Gilead is full of iniquity; Surely they have become corrupt; In Gilgal they sacrifice oxen, And their altars are like the heaps in the furrows of the field. 
Jacob fled into the country of Syria, And Israel served for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep. 
By a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet was he preserved. 
Ephraim hath provoked his Lord most bitterly; Therefore will he leave his blood upon him, And recompense to him his reproach.
