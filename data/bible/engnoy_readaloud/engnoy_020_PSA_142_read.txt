Psalms.
Chapter 142.
“A psalm of David; a prayer, when he was in the cave” I cry unto the LORD with my voice; With my voice to the LORD do I make my supplication. 
I pour out my complaint before him; I declare before him my distress. 
When my spirit is overwhelmed within me, Thou knowest my path! In the way which I walk, they have hid a snare for me. 
I look on my right hand, and behold, But no man knoweth me; Refuge faileth me; No one careth for me. 
I cry unto thee, O LORD! I say, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. 
Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they prevail against me! 
Bring me out of prison, That I may praise thy name! The righteous shall gather around me, When thou shalt show me thy favor.
