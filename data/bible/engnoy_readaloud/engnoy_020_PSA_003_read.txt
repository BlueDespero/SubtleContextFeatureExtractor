Psalms.
Chapter 3.
“A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.” How many, O LORD, are mine enemies! How many are they who rise up against me! 
How many are they who say of me, “There is no help for him with God”! Pause. 
But thou, O LORD! art my shield, My glory, and the lifter-up of my head. 
I call upon the LORD with my voice, And he heareth me from his holy hill. Pause. 
I lay me down and sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me. 
I will not fear the ten thousands of people Who on every side set themselves against me. 
Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For thou smitest the cheek of all my enemies; Thou breakest the teeth of the wicked. 
Deliverance cometh from the LORD: May thy blessing be with thy people! Pause.
