Psalms.
Chapter 70.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me; Make haste to help me, O Lord. 
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: Let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame That say, Aha, aha. 
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: Thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying.
