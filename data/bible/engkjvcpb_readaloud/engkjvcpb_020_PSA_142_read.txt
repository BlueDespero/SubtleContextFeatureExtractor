Psalms.
Chapter 142.
Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave. I cried unto the Lord with my voice; With my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication. 
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked Have they privily laid a snare for me. 
I looked on my right hand, and beheld, But there was no man that would know me: Refuge failed me; No man cared for my soul. 
I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge And my portion in the land of the living. 
Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I. 
Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
