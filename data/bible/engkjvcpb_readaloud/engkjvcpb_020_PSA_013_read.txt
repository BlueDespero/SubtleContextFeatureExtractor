Psalms.
Chapter 13.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart daily? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 
Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; And those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
But I have trusted in thy mercy; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 
I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
