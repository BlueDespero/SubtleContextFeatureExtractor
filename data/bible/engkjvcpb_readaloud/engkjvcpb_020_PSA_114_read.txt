Psalms.
Chapter 114.
When Israel went out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
Judah was his sanctuary, And Israel his dominion. 
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 
The mountains skipped like rams, And the little hills like lambs. 
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? Thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; And ye little hills, like lambs? 
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob; 
Which turned the rock into a standing water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
