Psalms.
Chapter 67.
To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us; And cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 
That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations. 
Let the people praise thee, O God; Let all the people praise thee. 
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: For thou shalt judge the people righteously, And govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 
Let the people praise thee, O God; Let all the people praise thee. 
Then shall the earth yield her increase; And God, even our own God, shall bless us. 
God shall bless us; And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
