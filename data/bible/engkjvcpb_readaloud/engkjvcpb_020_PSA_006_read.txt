Psalms.
Chapter 6.
To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 
My soul is also sore vexed: But thou, O Lord, how long? 
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy’s sake. 
For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In the grave who shall give thee thanks? 
I am weary with my groaning; All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
The Lord hath heard my supplication; The Lord will receive my prayer. 
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: Let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
