Psalms.
Chapter 96.
O sing unto the Lord a new song: Sing unto the Lord, all the earth. 
Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; Shew forth his salvation from day to day. 
Declare his glory among the heathen, His wonders among all people. 
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods. 
For all the gods of the nations are idols: But the Lord made the heavens. 
Honour and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, Give unto the Lord glory and strength. 
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: Fear before him, all the earth. 
Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth: The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: He shall judge the people righteously. 
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 
Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 
Before the Lord, for he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the people with his truth.
