Psalms.
Chapter 58.
To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 
Yea, in heart you work wickedness; You weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 
The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely. 
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord. 
Let them melt away as waters which run continually: When he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: Like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. 
Before your pots can feel the thorns, He shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. 
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
