Hosea.
Chapter 6.
Come, and let us return unto the Lord: For he hath torn, and he will heal us; He hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
After two days will he revive us: In the third day he will raise us up, And we shall live in his sight. 
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is prepared as the morning; And he shall come unto us as the rain, As the latter and former rain unto the earth. 
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? For your goodness is as a morning cloud, And as the early dew it goeth away. 
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: And thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. 
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: There have they dealt treacherously against me. 
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, And is polluted with blood. 
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, So the company of priests murder in the way by consent: For they commit lewdness. 
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: There is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
Also, O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, When I returned the captivity of my people.
