Psalms.
Chapter 84.
To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! 
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: My heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 
Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. 
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will be still praising thee. Selah. 
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the ways of them. 
Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; The rain also filleth the pools. 
They go from strength to strength, Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
Behold, O God our shield, And look upon the face of thine anointed. 
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
For the Lord God is a sun and shield: The Lord will give grace and glory: No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 
O Lord of hosts, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
