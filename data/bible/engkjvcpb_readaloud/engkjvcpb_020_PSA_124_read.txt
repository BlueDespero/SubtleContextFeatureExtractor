Psalms.
Chapter 124.
A Song of degrees of David. If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, Now may Israel say; 
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up against us: 
Then they had swallowed us up quick, When their wrath was kindled against us: 
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The stream had gone over our soul: 
Then the proud waters Had gone over our soul. 
Blessed be the Lord, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
