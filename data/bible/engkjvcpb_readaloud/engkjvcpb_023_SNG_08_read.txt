Song of Solomon.
Chapter 8.
O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; Yea, I should not be despised. 
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. 
His left hand should be under my head, And his right hand should embrace me. 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please. 
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: There thy mother brought thee forth: There she brought thee forth that bare thee. 
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, As a seal upon thine arm: For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as the grave: The coals thereof are coals of fire, Which hath a most vehement flame. 
Many waters cannot quench love, Neither can the floods drown it: If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, It would utterly be contemned. 
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? 
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: And if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar. 
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: Then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. 
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He let out the vineyard unto keepers; Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. 
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred. 
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, The companions hearken to thy voice: Cause me to hear it. 
Make haste, my beloved, And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart Upon the mountains of spices.
