Psalms.
Chapter 5.
To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Lord, Consider my meditation. 
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: For unto thee will I pray. 
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. 
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Neither shall evil dwell with thee. 
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: And in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. 
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face. 
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue. 
Destroy thou them, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee. 
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
