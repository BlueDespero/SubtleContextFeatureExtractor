Psalms.
Chapter 63.
A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, My flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 
To see thy power and thy glory, So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee. 
Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: 
When I remember thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night watches. 
Because thou hast been my help, Therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 
My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me. 
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 
They shall fall by the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes. 
But the king shall rejoice in God; Every one that sweareth by him shall glory: But the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
