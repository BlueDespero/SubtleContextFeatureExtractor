Psalms.
Chapter 62.
To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: From him cometh my salvation. 
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. 
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? Ye shall be slain all of you: As a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. 
They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: They delight in lies: They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 
My soul, wait thou only upon God; For my expectation is from him. 
He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my defence; I shall not be moved. 
In God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 
Trust in him at all times; ye people, Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. 
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: To be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. 
Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. 
God hath spoken once; Twice have I heard this; That power belongeth unto God. 
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: For thou renderest to every man according to his work.
