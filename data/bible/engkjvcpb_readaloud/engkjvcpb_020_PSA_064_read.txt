Psalms.
Chapter 64.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 
Who whet their tongue like a sword, And bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: 
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
They encourage themselves in an evil matter: They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who shall see them? 
They search out iniquities; They accomplish a diligent search: Both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly shall they be wounded. 
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: All that see them shall flee away. 
And all men shall fear, And shall declare the work of God; For they shall wisely consider of his doing. 
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.
