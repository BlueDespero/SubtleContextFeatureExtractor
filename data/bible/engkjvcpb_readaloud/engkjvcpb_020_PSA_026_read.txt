Psalms.
Chapter 26.
A Psalm of David. Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide. 
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; Try my reins and my heart. 
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: And I have walked in thy truth. 
I have not sat with vain persons, Neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
I have hated the congregation of evildoers; And will not sit with the wicked. 
I will wash mine hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Lord: 
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all thy wondrous works. 
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, And the place where thine honour dwelleth. 
Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with bloody men: 
In whose hands is mischief, And their right hand is full of bribes. 
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 
My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless the Lord.
