Psalms.
Chapter 108.
A Song or Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, Even with my glory. 
Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
For thy mercy is great above the heavens: And thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: And thy glory above all the earth. 
That thy beloved may be delivered; Save with thy right hand, and answer me. 
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, And mete out the valley of Succoth. 
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
Moab is my washpot; Over Edom will I cast out my shoe; Over Philistia will I triumph. 
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
Give us help from trouble: For vain is the help of man. 
Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
