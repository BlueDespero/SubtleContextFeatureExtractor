Psalms.
Chapter 136.
O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
O give thanks unto the God of gods: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
O give thanks to the Lord of lords: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him who alone doeth great wonders: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that by wisdom made the heavens: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that made great lights: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
The sun to rule by day: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
The moon and stars to rule by night: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
And brought out Israel from among them: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him which divided the Red sea into parts: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him which led his people through the wilderness: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him which smote great kings: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
And slew famous kings: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
Sihon king of the Amorites: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
And Og the king of Bashan: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
And gave their land for an heritage: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
Who remembered us in our low estate: For his mercy endureth for ever: 
And hath redeemed us from our enemies: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
Who giveth food to all flesh: For his mercy endureth for ever. 
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: For his mercy endureth for ever.
