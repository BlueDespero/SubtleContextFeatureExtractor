Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power. 
Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness. 
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: Praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
Praise him with the timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 
Praise him upon the loud cymbals: Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 
Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.
