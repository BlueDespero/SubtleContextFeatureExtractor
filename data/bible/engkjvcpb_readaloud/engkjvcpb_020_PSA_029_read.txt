Psalms.
Chapter 29.
A Psalm of David. Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, Give unto the Lord glory and strength. 
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. 
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth: The Lord is upon many waters. 
The voice of the Lord is powerful; The voice of the Lord is full of majesty. 
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; Yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire. 
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; The Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, And discovereth the forests: And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 
The Lord sitteth upon the flood; Yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever. 
The Lord will give strength unto his people; The Lord will bless his people with peace.
