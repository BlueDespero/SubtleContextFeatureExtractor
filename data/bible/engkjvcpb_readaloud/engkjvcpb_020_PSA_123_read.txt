Psalms.
Chapter 123.
A Song of degrees. Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, And as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, Until that he have mercy upon us. 
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scorning of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.
