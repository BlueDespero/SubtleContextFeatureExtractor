Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, And his praise in the congregation of saints. 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 
For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation. 
Let the saints be joyful in glory: Let them sing aloud upon their beds. 
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a twoedged sword in their hand; 
To execute vengeance upon the heathen, And punishments upon the people; 
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; 
To execute upon them the judgment written: This honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.
