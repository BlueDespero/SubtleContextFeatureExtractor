Psalms.
Chapter 98.
A Psalm. O sing unto the Lord a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 
The Lord hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 
Sing unto the Lord with the harp; With the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King. 
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein. 
Let the floods clap their hands: Let the hills be joyful together 
Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: With righteousness shall he judge the world, And the people with equity.
