Genesis.
Chapter 6.
After a long time there were many people. They scattered, they were everywhere. They all became really bad. They didn't listen to God. They kept on ignoring him. They kept talking to each other about how to do evil. Because of that God said, “The people are all doing bad things. They are always thinking about how to do evil. When I made them they were good, now they have become very bad. Because of that I am broken-hearted (lit: 'my stomach is broken'). I will kill the evil doers, and the animals and birds also.” 
Just one man pleased God. His name was Noah, he used to listen to God. He used to do good. He didn't do evil. He had three children, three males, their names were Shem, Ham, Japheth. 
God said to Noah, “All the other people are living really badly. They ignore me, they don't listen to me. They are talking to each other all the time to do evil and they are hitting/killing each other. Because of that reason I will kill them all. 
I will make a big flood for them. The big water will swallow them. You I will keep alive. 
You make a really big boat for fear of the flood. The flood will carry it on top. Make it very big and long and wide. You will make it from wood. 
You will enter it with your wife and your children and their wives. Gather animals and birds, cause them to enter the big boat. Collect them, animals, married-pair by married-pair, you will get different kinds pair by pair to make them enter the big boat. You will keep them alive from the flood. 
And gather for them different foods. For yourselves also heap up food in the boat.” 
Noah believed God. He made a very big boat, with wood he made it, long and wide. And he collected a large amount of different foods and put them in (the boat). Truly Noah did all in accordance with God's word.
