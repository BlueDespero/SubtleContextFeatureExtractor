James.
Chapter 1.
Remember, whoever wants to do evil, very truly he should not say, “God is tempting me to do evil.” No-one can tempt God to do evil, and God himself will not tempt a person to do evil. We ourselves want to do evil continually, and thinking about it tempts us to do that evil. If we continually do evil in that sort of way we will die.
