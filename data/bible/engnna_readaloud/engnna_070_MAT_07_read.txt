Matthew.
Chapter 7.
The gate to God's country is very narrow. Go through that one. The other gate is wide, and that one is to the big fire, and the road to that place is without problems. Many people go on that road. The gate that leads to God's country is narrow, and the road to that place is difficult. Only a few people find it.
