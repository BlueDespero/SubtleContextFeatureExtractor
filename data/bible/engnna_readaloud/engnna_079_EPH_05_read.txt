Ephesians.
Chapter 5.
Don't get drunk with wine, it will make you silly, you will do bad things without thinking. Better, give yourselves to the Holy Spirit, so that he can steer you in a proper way. 
Men truly look after their bodies. Truly in that way they should look after their wives. Whoever looks after his wife is looking after himself.
