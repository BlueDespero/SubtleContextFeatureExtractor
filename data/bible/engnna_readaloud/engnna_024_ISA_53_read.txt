Isaiah.
Chapter 53.
We are healed by the punishment he suffered, made whole by the blows he received. All of us were like sheep that were lost, each of us going his own way. But the Lord made the punishment fall on him, the punishment all of us deserved. For our wrongdoing God hit him. God whipped him, as a result of that he healed us. We all self-centredly did whatever we wanted to do. He did not hit us, he hit him for our badness.
