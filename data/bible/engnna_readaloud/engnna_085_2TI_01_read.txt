2 Timothy.
Chapter 1.
Properly we have believed in God. Then God gave us his good Spirit, truly he is without fault. That Spirit from God will stay in us forever. He does not make us fearful. He does not make us ashamed. He prompts us to do the right in accordance with God's word. He prompts us to put God, and all people also, in our feelings. He prompts us to do good and to leave evil also.
