1 Corinthians.
Chapter 6.
Truly you know evil-doers will not get into God's country. Don't trick yourselves. Some people are always looking for illegal sex, some worship carved representations of spirit beings, some sleep with other people's spouses, some men have sex with each other, some are thieves, some are greedy, some are drunks, some are false criticisers, some steal with violence. The ones who do those sorts of things will not get into God's country. Some of you used to be like that, now you're different. The Lord Jesus Christ and God's Spirit have separated you from evil, they have chosen you for God, they have joined you in a good way with God.
