Romans.
Chapter 6.
When Jesus christ died, it's like we also died; when they put him in the grave, it's like we also went into the grave. When he was raised to life by the Father, we also came to life joined with Jesus Christ. (Truly the Father is the expert for everything, nobody can stop him.) It became like that for us when someone baptised us. That's the way God did it for us, so that we can become different and stay in a really good way. 
People always do bad things, in exchange they will die. The people who are joined with Lord Jesus Christ our boss in exchange will stay in a good place. God will keep them alive forever.
