Psalms.
Chapter 63.
“A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.” (63:2) O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry land, and it is faint without water. 
(63:3) As I have beheld thee in the sanctuary, seeing thy strength and thy glory; 
(63:4) Because thy kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee: 
(63:5) Thus will I bless thee while I live; in thy name will I lift up my hands. 
(63:6) As with fat and marrow will my soul be satisfied; and with tuneful lips shall my mouth praise thee. 
(63:7) When I remember thee upon my couch, I meditate on thee in the night-watches. 
(63:8) Because thou hast been a help unto me; and in the shadow of thy wings will I sing rejoicingly. 
(63:9) My soul cleaveth unto following thee: me thy right hand upholdeth. 
(63:10) But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go down into the lowest deeps of the earth. 
(63:11) They shall be delivered up to the power of the sword: they shall become a prey for jackals. 
(63:12) But the king shall rejoice in God: every one that sweareth by him shall glorify himself; for the mouth of those that speak falsehood shall be stopped.
