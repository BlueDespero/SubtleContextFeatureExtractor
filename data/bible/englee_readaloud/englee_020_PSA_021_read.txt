Psalms.
Chapter 21.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (21:2) O Lord, because of thy strength will the king rejoice; and through thy salvation how greatly will he be glad! 
(21:3) The longing of his heart hast thou given him, and the request of his lips hast thou not withholden. Selah. 
(21:4) For thou meetest him unasked with the blessings of happiness: thou settest on his head a crown of pure gold. 
(21:5) Life hath he asked of thee, thou gavest it to him, length of days for ever and ever. 
(21:6) Great is his honor through thy help: glory and majesty thou layest upon him. 
(21:7) For thou appointest him to be a blessing for ever: thou makest him glad with joy from thy presence. 
(21:8) For the king trusteth in the Lord; and through the kindness of the Most High shall he not be moved. 
(21:9) Thy hand will reach all thy enemies: thy right hand will reach those that hate thee. 
(21:10) Thou wilt render them as a fiery oven at the time of thy anger: the Lord in his wrath will destroy them, and a fire will devour them. 
(21:11) Their fruit wilt thou cause to perish from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
(21:12) For they directed against thee evil: they devised a mischievous purpose, which they were not able to perform. 
(21:13) For thou wilt make them turn their back; upon thy bow-strings thou wilt make ready thy arrows against their face. 
(21:14) Exalt thyself, O Lord, in thy strength; and we will sing and praise thy power.
