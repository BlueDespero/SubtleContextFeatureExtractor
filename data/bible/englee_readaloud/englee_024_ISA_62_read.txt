Isaiah.
Chapter 62.
For the sake of Zion will I not be silent, and for the sake of Jerusalem will I not be quiet; until its righteousness go forth as the brightness of light, and its salvation as a burning torch. 
And nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and men shall call thee by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall pronounce. 
And thou shalt be a crown of ornament in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
Thou shalt not be termed any more “Forsaken,” and thy land shall not be termed any more “Desolate;” for thou shalt be called “My delight in her” Chephzi-bah, and thy land “Espoused” Be'ulah; for the Lord will have delight in thee, and thy land shall be espoused. 
For as a young man espouseth a virgin, so shall thy sons espouse thee; and as the bridegroom is glad over the bride, so will be glad over thee thy God. 
Over thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I appointed watchmen, all the day and all the night, continually, shall they not be silent: ye that make mention of the Lord, take ye no rest. 
And give him no rest, until he have established, and until he have set up Jerusalem as a praise on the earth. 
Sworn hath the Lord by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, I will not give thy corn any more as food for thy enemies, and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy young wine for which thou hast labored; 
But they who gather it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and they who bring it together shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary. 
Pass, pass through the gates, make clear the way of the people, cast up, cast up the highway, remove away the stones, lift up a banner over the nations. 
Behold, the Lord hath caused to be heard unto the ends of the earth, “Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.” 
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord; and thou shalt be called, Sought for, Derusha, The city never forsaken.
