Psalms.
Chapter 91.
He who sitteth under the secret protection of the Most High, shall rest under the shadow of the Almighty. 
I will say of the Lord, who is my refuge and my stronghold, my God, in whom I ever trust, 
That he will surely deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the pestilence of destruction. 
With his pinions will he cover thee, and under his wings shalt thou find shelter: shield and buckler is his truth. 
Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night; nor of the arrow that flieth by day; 
Nor of the pestilence that stalketh in darkness; nor of the deadly disease that wasteth at noonday. 
There shall fall at thy side a thousand, and ten thousand at thy right hand; unto thee however shall it not come nigh. 
Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold it, and see the recompense of the wicked. 
Because thou hast said, The Lord is my protection, the Most High hast thou made thy refuge: 
No evil shall befall thee, nor shall any plague come nigh unto thy tent. 
For his angels will he give charge concerning thee, to guard thee on all thy ways. 
Upon their hands shall they bear thee, that thou mayest not dash against a stone thy foot. 
Upon the fierce lion and asp shalt thou tread: thou shalt trample under foot the young lion and serpent. 
Because he hath fixed his desire upon me, therefore will I release him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name. 
He will call on me, and I will answer him: with him will I be in distress; I will deliver him, and grant him honor. 
With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will let him see my salvation.
