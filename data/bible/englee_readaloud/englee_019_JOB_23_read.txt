Job.
Chapter 23.
Then answered Job, and said, 
Even now is my complaint bitter: my suffering is heavier than my groans. 
Oh who would grant that I knew where I might find him! that I might attain to his Judgment throne! 
I would put in order before him my cause, and my mouth would I fill with arguments. 
I should know the words which he might answer me, and understand what he might say unto me. 
Would he with his power contend against me? he would truly not lay such doings to my charge. 
There would an upright one argue with him; and I should be allowed to escape for ever by my judge. 
But, lo, I go eastward—and he is not there; and to the west— and I cannot perceive him; 
When he doth great things at the north, I behold him not; he hideth himself in the south—and I see him not. 
But he knoweth the way that I take: were he to probe me, I should come forth as gold. 
On his steps my foot hath held fast: his way have I kept, and swerved not. 
From the commandment of his lips have I also not moved away: as a fixed statute for me have I treasured up the sayings of his mouth. 
But he is unchangeably one, and who can turn him? And what his will desireth, even that he doth. 
For he will bring to completion what hath been destined for me: and like these hath he many other things with him. 
Therefore am I terrified at his presence: I will reflect, and be in dread of him. 
Still God hath made timid my heart, and the Almighty hath terrified me; 
Because I was not destroyed before this darkness, and because he hath not hidden from my face this gloom.
