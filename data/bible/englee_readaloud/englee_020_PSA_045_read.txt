Psalms.
Chapter 45.
“To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, by the sons of Korach, a Maskil, a song of love.” (45:2) My heart swelleth with a good speech; I say, “My works shall be for the king:” my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 
(45:3) Thou art more fair than the children of men; grace is poured out over thy lips: therefore hath God blessed thee for ever. 
(45:4) Gird thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty one, it is thy glory and thy majesty; 
(45:5) Yea, it is thy majesty: be prosperous, ride along for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; and fearful things shall thy right hand teach thee. 
(45:6) Thy sharpened arrows—people will fall down beneath thee—will enter into the heart of the king's enemies. 
(45:7) Thy throne, given of God, endureth for ever and ever: the sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
(45:8) Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore hath God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy associates. 
(45:9) Of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are fragrant all thy garments: out of palaces of ivory have they made thee joyful with the sound of music. 
(45:10) Kings' daughters are among those dear to thee: the queen standeth on thy right hand in fine gold of Ophir. 
(45:11) Hearken, O daughter, and look, and incline thy ear, and forget thy own people, and thy father's house: 
(45:12) Then will the king long for thy beauty; for he is thy Lord; and bow thyself to him. 
(45:13) And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. 
(45:14) All gloriously attired awaiteth the king's daughter in the inner chamber: of wrought gold is her garment. 
(45:15) In embroidered clothes will she be brought unto the king: virgins that follow her, her companions, are brought unto thee. 
(45:16) They are led forth with rejoicings and gladness, they enter into the palace of the king. 
(45:17) Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children: thou wilt appoint them as princes in all the land. 
(45:18) I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
