Psalms.
Chapter 121.
“A song for the degrees.” I lift up my eyes unto the mountains: whence shall come my help? 
My help is from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth. 
He will not suffer thy foot to slip: thy keeper doth not slumber. 
Behold, he slumbereth not, and he sleepeth not—the keeper of Israel. 
The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade, he is on thy right hand. 
By day the sun shall not strike thee, nor the moon by night. 
The Lord will guard thee against all evil: he will guard thy soul. 
The Lord will guard thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and for evermore.
