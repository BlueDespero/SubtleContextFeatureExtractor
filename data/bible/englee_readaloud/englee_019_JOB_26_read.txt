Job.
Chapter 26.
Then answered Job, and said, 
What assistance hast thou given to the powerless? how hast thou helped the arm without strength? 
How hast thou counselled the unwise? and what sound wisdom hast thou made known so plentifully? 
To whom hast thou told words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
The departed are called into being beneath the waters, and their inhabitants. 
Naked is the nether world before him, and there is no covering for the place of corruption. 
He stretched out the north over empty space; he suspended the earth on nothing; 
He bound up the waters in his clouds; and the cloud bursteth not under their weight; 
He closed up the surface of his throne, spreading over it his cloud; 
A fixed limit he compassed off over the face of the waters, for the division of the light and darkness. 
The pillars of heaven tremble greatly, and are astounded at his rebuke. 
By his power he split in pieces the sea, and by his understanding he crushed its pride: 
By his breath the heavens acquired beauty; his hand hath created the flying serpent. 
Lo, these are ends of his ways; for how slight a whisper is heard by us of him! but the thunder of his mighty deeds who can understand?
