Job.
Chapter 41.
(40:25) Canst thou draw out the crocodile with a fishhook? or cause his tongue to sink into the batted rope? 
(40:26) Canst thou put a reed through his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
(40:27) Will he address many supplications unto thee? or will he speak submissively unto thee? 
(40:28) Will he make a covenant with thee? that thou couldst take him as a servant for ever? 
(40:29) Canst thou play with him as with a bird? and tie him up for thy maidens? 
(40:30) Can companions waylay him? can they divide him among merchants? 
(40:31) Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? and pierce with a fish-spear his head? 
(40:32) Lay thy hand upon him; think of the battle: thou wilt never do it again. 
(41:1) Behold, his expectation was deceived: even at his mere sight is he cast down. 
(41:2) None is so daring that he would stir him up: and who is there that will stand up before me? 
(41:3) Who hath shown me favor, that I should repay him! whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.— 
(41:4) I will not conceal the account of his limbs, nor the relation of his might, nor the grace of his proportion. 
(41:5) Who hath ever laid open the front of his garment? or who can penetrate into his double row of teeth? 
(41:6) Who hath opened the doors of his face? all round about his teeth abideth terror. 
(41:7) What pride is there in his strong shields; he is locked up as with a close seal. 
(41:8) One is joined to another; and no breath can come between them. 
(41:9) They are fitted closely one to another: they are interlocked, that they cannot be severed. 
(41:10) From his sneezing there beameth forth a light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning-dawn. 
(41:11) Out of his mouth issue burning torches, sparks of fire escape therefrom. 
(41:12) Out of his nostrils cometh forth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 
(41:13) His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh out of his mouth. 
(41:14) In his neck abideth strength, and before him danceth terror joyfully. 
(41:15) The flakes of his flesh are fitted closely together: they are as molten metal on him, immovable. 
(41:16) His heart is firm like a stone: yea, as firm as the nether millstone. 
(41:17) At his lifting himself up the mighty are terrified: the waves also are lessened. 
(41:18) If one overtake him with the sword, it cannot hold; nor the spear, the dart, and armor. 
(41:19) He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 
(41:20) The child of the bow cannot make him flee: into stubble are slingstones changed unto him. 
(41:21) Clubs are esteemed as stubble, and he laugheth at the whirring of the lance. 
(41:22) Beneath him are sharp-pointed potsherds, he spreadeth out, as it were, a threshing-roller upon the mire. 
(41:23) He causeth the deep to boil like a pot: he rendereth the sea like an apothecary's mixture. 
(41:24) Behind him he causeth his pathway to shine, so that men esteem the deep to be hoary. 
(41:25) There is none upon earth that ruleth over him, who is made to be without dread. 
(41:26) He looketh upon all that is high: he is the king over all the ravenous beasts.
