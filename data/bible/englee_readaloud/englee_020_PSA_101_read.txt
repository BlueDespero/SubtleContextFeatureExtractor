Psalms.
Chapter 101.
“By David, a psalm.” Of kindness and justice will I sing: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing praises. 
I will carefully regard the way of the perfect: oh when will thou come unto me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house. 
I will not set before my eyes a godless thing; to commit a departure from righteousness do I hate; it shall not cleave to me. 
A perverse heart shall depart from me: evil will I not know. 
Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbor, him will I destroy: whoso hath proud eyes and a haughty heart, him will I not suffer. 
My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may abide with me: he that walketh in the way of the perfect, he it is that shall serve me. 
He that practiseth deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that speaketh falsehoods shall not succeed before my eyes. 
Every morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off from the city of the Lord all the wrong-doers.
