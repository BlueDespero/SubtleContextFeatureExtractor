Psalms.
Chapter 4.
“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm of David.” (4:2) When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness: amidst distress thou hast ever granted me enlargement; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer. 
(4:3) O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame? how long will ye love vanity, will ye seek for lies? Selah. 
(4:4) But know that the Lord hath set apart the pious for himself: the Lord will hear when I call on him. 
(4:5) Tremble, and sin not: commune with your heart upon your bed, and be still Selah. 
(4:6) Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. 
(4:7) Many say, “Who will show us happiness? Let shine brightly over us the light of thy countenance, O Lord.” 
(4:8) But thou hast placed more joy in my heart than at the time when their corn and their wine were increased. 
(4:9) In peace, altogether, will I lay me down and sleep; for thou, Lord, alone, causest me to dwell in safety.
