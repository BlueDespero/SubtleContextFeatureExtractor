Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Hallelujah. Sing unto the Lord a new song, his praise in the congregation of the pious. 
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker: let the children of Zion exult in their King. 
Let them praise his name in the dance: with the timbrel and harp let them sing praises unto him. 
For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will adorn the meek with salvation. 
Let the pious be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their couches. 
The exalted praises of God are in their mouth, and a two-edged sword is in their hand; 
To execute vengeance on the nations, and chastisements on the people: 
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron: 
To execute upon them the judgment which is written: this is an honor for all his pious servants. Hallelujah.
