Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 11.
Cast thy bread upon the face of the waters; for after many days wilt thou find it again. 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what evil may come upon the earth.— 
If the clouds be full of rain, they will empty it out upon the earth; and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, on the place where the tree falleth, there will it remain. 
He that watcheth the wind will not sow; and he that gazeth on the clouds will not reap. 
As thou knowest not which is the way of the wind, as little as what is enclosed in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou canst not know the works of God who maketh all. 
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening let not thy hand rest; for thou knowest not which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both of them will be alike good. 
Truly the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to see the sun; 
For if a man live even many years, let him rejoice in them all; and let him remember the days of darkness; for they will be many; all that cometh is vanity. 
Rejoice, O young man, in thy childhood; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youthful vigor, and walk firmly in the ways of thy heart, and in the direction which thy eyes see: but know thou, that concerning all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 
And remove vexation from thy heart, and cause evil to pass away from thy body; for childhood and the time when the head is black are vanity.
