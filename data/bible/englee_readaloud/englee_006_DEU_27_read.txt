Deuteronomy.
Chapter 27.
And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep the whole commandment which I command you this day. 
And it shall be on the day when ye pass over the Jordan unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set up for thyself great stones, and cover them with plaster; 
And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, so soon as thou art passed over; in order that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; as the Lord, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee. 
And it shall be so soon as ye are gone over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, on mount 'Ebal; and thou shalt cover them with plaster. 
And thou shalt build there an altar unto the Lord thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them. 
Of whole stones shalt thou build the altar of the Lord thy God; and thou shalt offer thereupon burnt-offerings unto the Lord thy God; 
And thou shalt slay peace-offerings, and eat them there; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God. 
And thou shalt write upon the statues all the words of this law, very plainly. 
And Moses with the priests, the Levites, spoke unto all Israel, saying, Be attentive, and hearken, O Israel! this day art thou become a people unto the Lord thy God. 
Thou shalt therefore hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day. 
And Moses commanded the people on the same day, saying, 
These shall stand upon mount Gerizzim to bless the people, when ye are come over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin. 
And these shall stand for the sake of the curse upon mount 'Ebal: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
And the Levites shall commence, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice, 
Cursed be the man who maketh a graven or molten image, the abomination of the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place; and all the people shall answer, and say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that holdeth in light esteem his father or his mother; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that removeth the landmark of his neighbor; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that causeth the blind to wander out of the way; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that perverteth the cause of the stranger, of the fatherless, and of the widow; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay a person, an innocent blood; and all the people shall say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that executeth not the words of this law to do them; and all the people shall say, Amen.
