Psalms.
Chapter 70.
“To the chief musician, by David, to bring to remembrance.” (70:2) O God, arise to deliver me; O Lord, make haste to help me. 
(70:3) Let those that seek after my life be made ashamed and put to the blush: let those that desire my unhappiness be turned backward and put to confusion. 
(70:4) Let them be turned backward in consequence of their shame, that say, Aha, aha. 
(70:5) Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, God is great. 
(70:6) But I am poor and needy, O God: come hastily unto me; my help and my deliverer art thou: O Lord, do not delay.
