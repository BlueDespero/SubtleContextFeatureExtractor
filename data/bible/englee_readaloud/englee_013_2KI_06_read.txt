2 Kings.
Chapter 6.
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha', Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too narrow for us. 
Let us go, we pray thee, as far as the Jordan, and take thence every man one beam, and let us prepare for us there a place to dwell therein. And he said, Go. 
And one said, Give thy assent, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he said, I will indeed go. 
So he went with them; and they came to the Jordan, and they cut down trees. 
But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, my Lord! it was also borrowed. 
And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and he caused the iron to swim. 
And then said he, Lift it up to thee. And he stretched out his hand, and took it. 
And the king of Syria made war against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. 
And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not that place; for thither the Syrians are come down. 
And the king of Israel sent to the place, which the man of God had told him and warned him of, and he took care of himself there: not once nor twice. 
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sorely troubled concerning this thing; and he called for his servants, and said unto them, Can ye not tell me who of us is for the king of Israel? 
And one of his servants said, Not so, my Lord, O king; but Elisha', the prophet that is in Israel, can tell unto the king of Israel the words that thou mayest speak in thy sleeping-chamber. 
And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told unto him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. 
And he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a strong army: and they came by night, and surrounded the city. 
And the servant of the man of God rose early, and went forth, when, behold, an army compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? 
And he said, Fear not: for those that are with us are more than those that are with them. 
And Elisha' prayed, and said, O Lord, open, I pray thee, his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man: and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha'. 
And when they came down to him, Elisha' prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite, I pray thee, this people with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha'. 
And Elisha' said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom ye wish to seek. And he led them thus to Samaria. 
And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha' said, Lord, open the eyes of these, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. 
And the king of Israel said unto Elisha', when he saw them, Shall I smite them? Shall I smite them, my father? 
But he said, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go back to their master. 
And he prepared for them a great meal; and they ate and drank, and he sent them away, and they went back to their master. And the predatory bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 
And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad the king of Syria assembled all his camp, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 
And there was a great famine in Samaria; and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. 
And it happened as the king of Israel was passing along upon the wall, that a woman cried unto him, saying, Help, my Lord, O king. 
And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? shall it be out of the threshing-floor, or out of the wine-press? 
And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she said, This woman said unto me, Give up thy son, that we may eat him today, and my son we will eat tomorrow. 
So we boiled my son, and ate him; but when I said unto her on the next day, Give up thy son, that we may eat him: she hid her son. 
And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes, as he was passing along upon the wall: and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth beneath upon his flesh. 
Then said he, May God do so unto me and continue so yet farther, if the head of Elisha' the son of Shaphat shall remain on him this day. 
But Elisha' was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and he sent a man from before him; but before the messenger could yet come to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of the murderer hath sent to remove my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him back with the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him? 
And while he was yet speaking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what shall I hope for in the Lord any longer?
