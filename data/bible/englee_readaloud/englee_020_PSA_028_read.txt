Psalms.
Chapter 28.
“Of David.” Unto thee, O Lord, will I call; O my rock, turn not unheeding from me: lest thou turn away silent from me, and I become like those that go down into the pit. 
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the most holy place of thy sanctuary. 
Snatch me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of injustice, who speak peace with their neighbors, with mischief in their heart. 
Give unto them according to their doing, and according to the evil of their deeds; according to the work of their hands do thou give unto them: bestow their just recompense on them. 
Because they have no regard for the doings of the Lord, nor the works of his hands: may he pull them down, and not build them up. 
Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him hath my heart trusted, and I am helped, and my heart exulteth; and with my song will I thank him. 
The Lord is strength unto them, and he is the fortress of victory of his anointed. 
Help thy people, and bless thy heritage: and feed them, and exalt them unto all eternity.
