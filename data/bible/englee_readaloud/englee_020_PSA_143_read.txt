Psalms.
Chapter 143.
“A psalm of David.” O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness. 
And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for no living man can be regarded righteous before thee. 
For the enemy hath pursued my soul; he hath crushed to the ground my life; he hath made me dwell in darkness, as those that are dead eternally. 
And my spirit within me is overwhelmed: in my bosom is my heart astounded. 
I remember the days of olden times: I meditate on all thy doings: on the work of thy hands do I reflect. 
I spread forth my hands unto thee: my soul longeth for thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 
Hasten, answer me, O Lord, my spirit falleth: hide not thy face from me, that I may not become like those that go down into the pit. 
Cause me to hear in the morning thy kindness; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way whereon I should walk; for unto thee do I lift up my soul. 
Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies: by thee do I seek shelter. 
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; guide me on a level land. 
For thy sake, O Lord, revive me: in thy righteousness bring forth out of distress my soul. 
And in thy kindness destroy my enemies, and annihilate all the adversaries of my soul; far I am thy servant.
