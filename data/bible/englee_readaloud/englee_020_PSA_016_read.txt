Psalms.
Chapter 16.
“A Michtham of David.” Preserve me, O God; for I have placed my trust in thee. 
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my happiness is not without thee; 
But in the saints who are on the earth, and in the excellent—in them is all my delight. 
Multiplied shall be the sorrows of those who give presents to another god: I will not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, nor bear their names upon my lips. 
Thou, O Lord, art the portion of my inheritance, and my cup; thou hast drawn my lot. 
My possessions are fallen in agreeable places: yea, my heritage is pleasant to me. 
I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: also in the night seasons my reins admonish me. 
I have always set the Lord before me, that, being at my right hand, I might not be moved. 
Therefore is rejoiced my heart, and my spirit is glad: also my flesh shall rest in safety. 
For thou wilt not abandon my soul to the grave: thou wilt not suffer thy pious servant to see corruption. 
Thou wilt let me know the path of life: fulness of joy is in thy presence; pleasures are at thy right hand for evermore.
