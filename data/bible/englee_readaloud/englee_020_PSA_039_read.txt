Psalms.
Chapter 39.
“To the chief musician, to Jeduthun, a psalm of David.” (39:2) I said, I will guard my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked is before me. 
(39:3) I was dumb in deep silence, I was quite still, even from speaking good; but my pain was greatly excited; 
(39:4) My heart was hot within me, in my self-communing there burnt a fire: then spoke I with my tongue, 
(39:5) Let me know, O Lord, my end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I wish to know when I shall cease to be. 
(39:6) Behold, measured out with the span hast thou made my days; and my whole duration is nothing before thee: yea, as nothing but vanity doth every man stand here. Selah. 
(39:7) As nothing but a shadowy image doth man walk about, yea, for vanity only do all make a noise: he heapeth up his gains, and knoweth not who shall gather them. 
(39:8) And now, what shall I wait for, O Lord? my hope is in thee. 
(39:9) From all my transgressions deliver thou me: render me not the object of reproach of the worthless. 
(39:10) I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou hadst done it. 
(39:11) Remove thou thy plague away from me: from the blows of thy hand am I consumed. 
(39:12) When thou with corrections chastisest man for iniquity, thou causest his excellence to melt away as if eaten by the moth: yea, nothing but vanity is every man. Selah. 
(39:13) Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; be not silent at my tears; for a stranger am I with thee, a sojourner, like all my fathers. 
(39:14) Leave off from me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and am no more.
