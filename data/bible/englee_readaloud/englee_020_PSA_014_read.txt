Psalms.
Chapter 14.
“To the chief musician, by David.” The worthless fool saith in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they are abominable in their doings, there is none that doth good. 
The Lord looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be one intelligent, one who seeketh for God. 
They are all gone aside, they are altogether become corrupt: there is none that doth good, no, not even one. 
Is there no knowledge in all the workers of wickedness? who eat up my people as they eat bread; while they do not call on the Lord. 
There are they terrified in terror; for God is with the righteous generation: 
The counsel of the poor though you put to shame; because the Lord is his protection. 
Oh that some one might bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion! When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, then will Jacob be glad, and Israel will rejoice.
