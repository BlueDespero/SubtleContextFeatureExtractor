2 Kings.
Chapter 24.
In his days came up Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and Jehoyakim became his servant for three years: and then he returned and rebelled against him. 
And the Lord sent against him predatory bands of the Chaldeans, and predatory bands of the Syrians, and predatory bands of the Moabites, and predatory bands of the children of 'Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by means of his servants the prophets. 
But only at the order of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove the same out of his sight, for the sins of Menasseh, in accordance with all that he had done; 
And also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; wherefore the Lord would not pardon. 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoyakim, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. 
And Jehoyakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoyachin his son became king in his stead. 
And the king of Egypt came no more again out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that had pertained to the king of Egypt. 
Eighteen years old was Jehoyachin when he became king, and three months did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Nechushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as that his father had done. 
At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was put in a state of siege. 
And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came against the city, while his servants were besieging it. 
And Jehoyachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his court-officers: and the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 
And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, as the Lord had spoken. 
And he led away as exiles all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand exiles, and all the craftsmen and locksmiths: there was none left, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
And he led away Jehoyachin as exile to Babylon; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his court-officers, and the mighty men of the land, he led into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
And all the men of might, seven thousand in number, and the craftsmen and the locksmiths a thousand in number, all strong men, apt for war; and the king of Babylon brought them into exile to Babylon. 
And the king of Babylon made Mattanyah his uncle king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
Twenty and one years old was Zedekiah when he became king, and eleven years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Chamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as Jehoyakim had done. 
For through the anger of the Lord it occurred in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
