Psalms.
Chapter 43.
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: from the deceitful and unjust man do thou deliver me. 
For thou art the God of my fortress: why hast thou abandoned me? why must I walk about grieved, under the oppression of the enemy? 
Send thou thy light and thy truth, these shall guide me; they shall bring me unto thy holy mountain, and to thy dwellings: 
That I may go unto the altar of God, unto God the joy of my gladness; and that I may thank thee upon the harp, O God, my God. 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
