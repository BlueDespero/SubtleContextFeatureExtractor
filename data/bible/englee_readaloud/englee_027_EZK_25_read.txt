Ezekiel.
Chapter 25.
And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against the sons of 'Ammon, and prophesy against them; 
And say unto the sons of 'Ammon, Hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast said, Aha, concerning my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and concerning the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and concerning the house of Judah, when they went into exile: 
Therefore, behold, I will give thee up to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set up their towers in thee, and place in thee their dwellings; they shall indeed eat thy fruit, and they shall surely drink thy milk. 
And I will change Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and the land of the sons of 'Ammon into a resting-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 
For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thou didst clap thy hands, and stamp with thy feet, and rejoice with all thy derision in the soul over the land of Israel: 
Therefore, behold, will I stretch out my hand over thee, and will give thee up for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries; I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. 
Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because Moab and Se'ir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations: 
Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-ha-yeshimoth, Ba'al-me'on, and Kiryathayim, 
Unto the children of the east coming against the sons of 'Ammon, and I will give them in possession; in order that the sons of 'Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 
And on Moab will I execute judgments: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the Edomites have acted revengefully against the house of Judah, and have greatly offended, and have taken vengeance on them: 
Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it man and beast; and I will make it a ruined land from Theman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 
And I will display my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury: and they shall feel my vengeance, saith the Lord Eternal. 
Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the Philistines have acted in revenge, and have taken vengeance with derision in their soul, to destroy out of ancient enmity: 
Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethim, and destroy the remnant of the dwellers of the sea-coast. 
And I will execute on them great vengeances with furious chastisements: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I display my vengeance on them.
