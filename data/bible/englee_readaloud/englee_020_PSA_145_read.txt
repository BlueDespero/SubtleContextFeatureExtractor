Psalms.
Chapter 145.
“A hymn of praise by David.” I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 
Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 
Great is the Lord, and greatly praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. 
One generation shall praise thy works to the other, and thy mighty acts shall they declare. 
On the majestic glory of thy excellence, and on thy wondrous deeds will I meditate. 
And of the might of thy terrible acts shall men converse: and thy greatness will I relate. 
The memorial of thy abundant goodness shall they loudly proclaim, and they shall sing joyfully of thy righteousness. 
Gracious and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering, and great in kindness. 
The Lord is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works. 
All thy works shall thank thee, O Lord; and thy pious servants shall bless thee. 
Of the glory of thy kingdom shall they converse, and of thy might shall they speak: 
To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all eternities, and thy dominion subsisteth throughout all generations. 
The Lord upholdeth all who are falling, and raiseth up all those who are bowed down. 
The eyes of all wait hopefully upon thee, and thou givest them their food in its due season. 
Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 
Righteous is the Lord in all his ways, and beneficent in all his works. 
The Lord is nigh unto all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. 
The desire of those who fear him will he fulfill, and their cry will he hear, and save them. 
The Lord preserveth all those who love him; but all the wicked will he destroy. 
The praise of the Lord shall my mouth speak: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
