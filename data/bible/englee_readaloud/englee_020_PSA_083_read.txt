Psalms.
Chapter 83.
“A song or psalm of Assaph.” (83:2) O God, take no rest for thyself: be not silent and keep not still, O God! 
(83:3) For, lo, thy enemies make a tumult, and they that hate thee have lifted up their head. 
(83:4) Against thy people they take crafty secret device, and they consult against those whom thou protectest. 
(83:5) They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; and the name of Israel shall be remembered no more. 
(83:6) For they have consulted cordially together; against thee they make a covenant: 
(83:7) The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites: Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
(83:8) Gebal, and 'Ammon, and 'Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
(83:9) Also Asshur is joined with them; they have become an arm unto the children of Lot. Selah. 
(83:10) Do unto them as unto Midian; as to Sissera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon: 
(83:11) Who were annihilated at 'En-dor; they became as dung for the ground. 
(83:12) Render them, their nobles, like 'Oreb, and like Zeeb; yea, like Zebach and like Zalmunna' all their princes; 
(83:13) Who said, Let us conquer for ourselves the dwellings of God, 
(83:14) O my God, render them like the thistle-down, like stubble before the wind. 
(83:15) As the fire burneth up a forest, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire: 
(83:16) So pursue them with thy storm, and with thy whirlwind do thou terrify them. 
(83:17) Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Lord! 
(83:18) Let them be made ashamed and terrified for ever and aye; yea, let them be put to the blush and perish: 
(83:19) That they may know that thou, whose name is the Eternal, art by thyself alone, the Most High over all the earth.
