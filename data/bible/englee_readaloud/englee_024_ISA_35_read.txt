Isaiah.
Chapter 35.
The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad thereat; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the lily. 
It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, yea, with joy and singing; the glory of the Lebanon shall be given unto it, the elegance of Carmel and Sharon; they indeed shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. 
Strengthen ye weak hands, and stumbling knees make ye firm. 
Say to the timid of heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God, with vengeance will he come, with God's recompense; it is he who will come and save you. 
Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. 
Then shall the lame leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and brooks in the desert. 
And the sandy waste shall be changed into a pool, and the thirsty land into springs of water: in the habitation of monsters, where each one used to lie, shall be a court for reeds and rushes. 
And there shall be a highway and a way, and The holy way, shall it be called; no unclean one shall pass over it; but it shall be only theirs; the wayfaring man, and those unacquainted therewith, shall not go astray. 
No lion shall be there, and no ravenous beast shall go up thereon, shall not be found there; but there shall walk the redeemed: 
And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with song, with everlasting joy upon their head; gladness and joy shall they obtain, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
