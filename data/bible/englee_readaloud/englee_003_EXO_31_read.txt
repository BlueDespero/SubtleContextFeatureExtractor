Exodus.
Chapter 31.
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, of the tribe of Judah: 
And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
To devise works of art, to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper, 
And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in the carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
And behold, I have also given with him Aholiab, the son of Achissamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted have l put wisdom; and they shall make all that I have commanded thee; 
The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the cover that is thereupon, and all the vessels of the tabernacle; 
And the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense; 
And the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot; 
And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister therein; 
And the anointing oil, and the incense of spices for the holy place: all as I have commanded thee shall they do. 
And the Lord said unto Moses as followeth, 
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Above all, my sabbaths shall ye keep; for a sign it is between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord who doth sanctify you. 
And ye shall keep the sabbath, for it is holy unto you; every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work thereon, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
Six days may work be done; but on the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath-day, shall surely be put to death. 
And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
Between me and the children of Israel it shall be a sign for ever; for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed: 
And he gave unto Moses, when he had finished speaking with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, inscribed with the finger of God.
