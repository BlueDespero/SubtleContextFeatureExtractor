Jonah.
Chapter 2.
(2:2) Then prayed Jonah unto the Lord his God out of the belly of the fish. 
(2:3) And he said, I called from the midst of my distress unto the Lord, and he hath answered me: out of the depth of the grave have I cried, and thou hast heard my voice. 
(2:4) For thou hast cast me into the deep, in the heart of the seas; and the stream compasseth me about: all thy billows and thy waves have passed over me. 
(2:5) And I thought indeed, I am driven out from before thy eyes: yet I again shall look toward thy holy temple. 
(2:6) The waters surrounded me, to the peril of my life; the deep compassed me about: sea-weeds were bound about my head. 
(2:7) To the bottoms of the mountains did I go down; the earth closed her bars about me for ever: when thou broughtest up my life from the pit, O Lord my God! 
(2:8) When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came unto thee, unto thy holy temple. 
(2:9) They that guard false vanities forsake the source of their kindness. 
(2:10) But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed will I pay; for help is with the Lord. 
(2:11) And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
