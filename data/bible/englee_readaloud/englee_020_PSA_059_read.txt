Psalms.
Chapter 59.
“To the chief musician, Al-tashcheth, by David, a Michtham, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to put him to death.” (59:2) Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 
(59:3) Deliver me from the workers of wickedness, and from men of blood do thou save me. 
(59:4) For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul, the mighty are gathered in troops against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord. 
(59:5) Without guilt in me they run and make themselves ready: awake, come toward me, and behold. 
(59:6) And thou, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to punish all the nations: be not gracious to any treacherous wicked one. Selah. 
(59:7) They will return at evening; they will howl like dogs, and go round about the city. 
(59:8) Behold, they sputter with their mouth: swords are in their lips; for who, say they, doth hear? 
(59:9) But thou, O Lord, wilt laugh at theme: thou wilt hold in derision all the nations. 
(59:10) Because of the enemy's strength will I wait upon thee; for God is my defence. 
(59:11) The God who showeth me kindness will go before me: God will let me see my desire upon those who regard me with envy. 
(59:12) Slay them not, that my people may not forget: drive them about by thy power; and bring them down, thou our shield, O Lord. 
(59:13) The sin of their mouth is the word of their lips: let them be caught through their pride, because of the cursing and lying which they relate. 
(59:14) Make an end in fury, make an end of them, that they my be no more, and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, as far as the ends of the earth. Selah. 
(59:15) And they will return in the evening; they will howl like dogs, and go round about the city. 
(59:16) They will indeed roam about after something to eat, if they be not satisfied, so that they can be at rest. 
(59:17) But I will truly sing of thy strength; yea, I will sing joyfully in the morning of thy kindness; for thou hast been a defence unto me and a refuge on the day when I was distressed. 
(59:18) Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; for God is my defence, the God of my kindness.
