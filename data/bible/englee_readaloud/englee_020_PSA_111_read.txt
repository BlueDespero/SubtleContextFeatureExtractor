Psalms.
Chapter 111.
Hallelujah. I will thank the Lord with all my heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
Great are the works of the Lord, they are sought for by them in all their desires. 
Glorious and majestic is his doing, and his righteousness endureth for ever. 
He hath made a memorial for his wonderful works: gracious and merciful is the Lord. 
He hath given sustenance unto those that fear him: he will for ever be mindful of his covenant. 
The power of his works hath he told unto his people, that he might give them the heritage of nations. 
The works of his hands are truth and justice: faultless are all his precepts. 
They are well supported for ever and eternally: they are framed in truth and uprightness. 
Redemption hath he sent unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and to be feared is his name. 
The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; a good understanding have all that fulfill his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
