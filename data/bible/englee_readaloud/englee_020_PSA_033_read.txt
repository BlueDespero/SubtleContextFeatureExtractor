Psalms.
Chapter 33.
Be joyful, O ye righteous, in the Lord; for unto the righteous praise is comely. 
Give thanks unto the Lord with the harp: with the ten-stringed psaltery do ye sing praises unto him. 
Sing unto him a new song; play beautifully amidst a triumphant shout. 
For the word of the Lord is upright; and all his works are done in truth. 
He loveth righteousness and justice: the earth is full of the kindness of the Lord. 
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 
He gathereth together like heaps the waters of the sea: he layeth up in store-houses the depths of the sea. 
Let all the earth fear the Lord: of him stand in awe all the inhabitants of the world. 
For he spoke, and it came into being: he commanded, and it stood fast. 
The Lord frustrateth the resolves of the nations: he bringeth to nought the thoughts of the people. 
The counsel of the Lord will stand for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation. 
Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he hath chosen for himself as a heritage. 
The Lord looketh from heaven; he seeth all the sons of men. 
From the place of his habitation he directeth his view upon all the inhabitants of the earth; 
He fashioneth their hearts altogether; he hath regard to all their works. 
The king is not saved by the multitude of an army: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
Vain is the horse for victory: nor shall he deliver any by the greatness of his strength. 
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those that fear him, upon those that hope for his kindness. 
To deliver from death their soul, and to keep them alive in famine. 
Our soul waiteth for the Lord: our help and our shield is he. 
For in him shall our heart rejoice: because in his holy name have we trusted. 
Let thy kindness, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in thee.
