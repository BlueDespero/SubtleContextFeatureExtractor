Psalms.
Chapter 24.
“Of David a psalm.” Unto the Lord belongeth the earth with what filleth it, the world and they that dwell therein; 
For upon seas hath he founded it, and upon rivers hath he established it. 
Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? and who shall be able to stand in his holy place? 
He that is of clean hands, and pure of heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, and hath not sworn deceitfully: 
He shall bear away blessing from the Lord, and the reward of righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
This is the generation of those that adore him, that seek thy presence, the sons of Jacob. Selah. 
Raise your heads, O ye gates; and be raised wide, ye everlasting doors: and let the King of glory enter! 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. 
Raise your heads, O ye gates; and raise them up, ye everlasting doors: and let the King of glory enter! 
Who is then this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
