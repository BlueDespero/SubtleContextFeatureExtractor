Psalms.
Chapter 84.
“To the chief musician upon Gittith, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” (84:2) How lovely are thy dwelling-places, O Lord of hosts! 
(84:3) My soul desired, yea, it also longed for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh shout with joy unto the living God. 
(84:4) Even as the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young:—have I found thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. 
(84:5) Happy are they who dwell in thy house: they will be continually praising thee. Selah. 
(84:6) Happy is the man whose strong confidence is in thee, all whose heart reflecteth on the paths of righteousness. 
(84:7) Passing through the valley of weeping, they will change it into a spring: also the early rain covereth it with blessings. 
(84:8) They go from strength to strength, each of them appeareth before God in Zion. 
(84:9) O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
(84:10) Thou, our shield, behold, O God, and look upon the face of thy anointed. 
(84:11) For better is a day in thy courts than a thousand elsewhere: I would rather choose to wait at the threshold of the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
(84:12) For a sun and shield is the Lord God; grace and glory will the Lord give; he will not withhold any good from those that walk with integrity. 
(84:13) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee.
