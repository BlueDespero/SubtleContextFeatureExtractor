Zechariah.
Chapter 4.
And the angel that spoke with me came back again, and waked me up, as a man that is wakened up out of his sleep; 
And he said unto me, What art thou seeing? And I said, I have looked, and behold, there is a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon its top, and its seven lamps are thereupon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon its top: 
And two olive-trees are by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. 
And I commenced and said unto the angel that spoke with me, saying, What are these, my lord? 
Then the angel that spoke with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord. 
Then answered he and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. 
Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou wilt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone with shoutings of, Grace, grace unto it. 
And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall complete it: and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. 
For whoever even despised the day of its small beginning: yet will they rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which hold a survey through all the earth. 
And I began, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candle-stick and upon its left? 
And I began a second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are close by the two golden pipes which empty out of themselves the gold-colored oil? 
And he said to me as followeth, Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said, No, my lord. 
Then said he, These are the two sons of the clear oil, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
