Psalms.
Chapter 131.
“A song of the degrees by David.” O Lord, my heart was not haughty, nor were my eyes lofty: neither have I walked after matters too great, or those too wonderful for me. 
Surely I have pacified and stilled my soul, like the suckling on its mother's breast: like a suckling is in me my soul. 
Let Israel wait for the Lord from this time forth and for ever more.
