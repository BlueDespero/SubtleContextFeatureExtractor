Psalms.
Chapter 6.
“To the chief musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.” (6:2) O Lord, correct me not in thy anger, and chastise me not in thy wrath. 
(6:3) Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for I am withering away; heal me, O Lord; for my bones are terrified. 
(6:4) And my soul is greatly terrified; but thou, O Lord, how long yet—? 
(6:5) Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: help me for the sake of thy kindness. 
(6:6) For in death men do not remember thee: in the nether world, who shall give thee thanks? 
(6:7) I am weary with my sighing; I flood every night my bed; With my tears I moisten my couch. 
(6:8) My eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all my assailants. 
(6:9) Depart from me, all ye workers of wickedness; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
(6:10) The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will accept my prayer. 
(6:11) Ashamed and greatly terrified shall become all my enemies; they will turn round, and be made ashamed in a moment.
