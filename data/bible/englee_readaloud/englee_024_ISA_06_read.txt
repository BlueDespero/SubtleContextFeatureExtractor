Isaiah.
Chapter 6.
In the year of king 'Uzziyahu's death I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and exalted throne, and his train filled the temple. 
Seraphim were standing around him, each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two did he fly. 
And one called unto the other, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory. 
And the posts of the threshold shook at the voice of those that called aloud, and the house was filled with smoke. 
And I said, Woe is me! for I am lost; because a man of unclean lips am I, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips do I dwell; for the King, the Lord of hosts have my eyes seen. 
Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, and in his hand was a live coal, with the tongs had he taken it from off the altar: 
And he touched therewith upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is departed, and thy sin is forgiven. 
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I: send me. 
And he said, Go, and say unto this people, Hear indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but know not. 
Obdurate will remain the heart of this people, and their ears will be heavy, and their eyes will be shut: so that they will not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor their hearts be understanding, so that they be converted, and healing be granted them. 
And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until that cities be left waste without an inhabitant, and houses without man, and the soil be made desolate as a wilderness, 
And the Lord will have removed far away the men, and the depopulation be great in the midst of the land. 
And should a tenth part thereof yet remain, it will again be swept away: yet like the terebinth and the oak, which, when they cast their leaves, retain their stems, so remaineth the holy seed, its stem.
