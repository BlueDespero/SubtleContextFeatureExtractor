Genesis.
Chapter 3.
Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made; and he said unto the woman, Hath God indeed said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; 
But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye will surely not die; 
For God doth know, that, on the day ye eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil. 
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. 
And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they felt that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. 
And the Lord God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou? 
And he said, Thy voice I heard in the garden; and I was afraid, because I am naked; and I hid myself. 
And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 
And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 
And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 
And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt wound his heel. 
Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and the suffering of thy conception; in pain shalt thou bring forth children; and for thy husband shall be thy desire, but he shall rule over thee. 
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed be the ground for thy sake; in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. 
And thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field. 
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 
And the man called his wife's name Eve Chavvah; because she was the mother of all living Chay. 
And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skins, and clothed them. 
And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever— 
Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flaming sword which revolveth, to guard the way to the tree of life.
