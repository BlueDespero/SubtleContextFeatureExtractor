Psalms.
Chapter 26.
“Of David.” Judge me, O Lord; for I have indeed walked in my integrity: and in the Lord have I trusted; I shall not slip. 
Try me, O Lord, and prove me; purify my reins and my heart. 
For thy kindness is before my eyes; and I have walked in thy truth. 
I have not sat with men of falsehood, and with dissemblers will I not enter in communion. 
I have hated the assemblage of evil-doers; and with the wicked will I not sit. 
I will wash in innocency my hands, and I will compass thy altar, O Lord: 
That I may publish with a loud voice my thanksgiving, and relate all thy wondrous deeds. 
Lord, I love the site of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. 
Take not away with sinners my soul, nor with men of blood my life; 
In whose hands are wicked devices, and whose right hand is full of bribes. 
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be gracious unto me. 
My foot standeth on an even place: in assemblies will I bless the Lord.
