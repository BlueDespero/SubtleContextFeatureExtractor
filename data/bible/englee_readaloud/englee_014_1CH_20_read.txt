1 Chronicles.
Chapter 20.
And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the same season of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that Joab led out the power of the army, and destroyed the country of the children of 'Ammon, and he came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained behind at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and pulled it down. 
And David took the crown of Malkam from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and thereon a precious stone; and it was set on the head of David: and the booty of the city he brought out in great abundance. 
And the people that were therein he brought forward, and cut them with saws, and with iron threshing-wagons, and with axes; and thus did David unto all the cities of the children of 'Ammon; and David returned then with all the people unto Jerusalem. 
And it came to pass after this, that there arose a battle at Gezer with the Philistines: then smote Sibbechai the Chushathite Sippai, one of the children of the Rapha; and they were humbled. 
And there was again a battle with the Philistines, when Elchanan the son of Yair smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
And there was again a battle at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were six on each hand and foot, four and twenty in all; and he also was born to the Rapha. 
And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shim'a the brother of David smote him. 
These were born unto the Rapha in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
