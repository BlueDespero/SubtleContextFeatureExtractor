The Book of Psalms.
Chapter 1.
BOOK FIRST: Happy is the man who walketh not in the council of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners; 
But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who doth meditate in his law by day and night. 
And he shall be like a tree planted by rivulets of water, that yieldeth its fruit in its season, and the leaf of which doth not wither; and all that he may do shall prosper. 
Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
Therefore shall the wicked not be able to stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
For the Lord regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked leadeth to perdition.
