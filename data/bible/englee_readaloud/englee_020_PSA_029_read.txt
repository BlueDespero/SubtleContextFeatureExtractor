Psalms.
Chapter 29.
“A psalm of David.” Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of the mighty, ascribe unto the Lord glory and strength. 
Ascribe unto the Lord the glory of his name; bow down to the Lord in the beauty of holiness. 
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth, the Lord—upon mighty waters. 
The voice of the Lord resoundeth with power; the voice of the Lord resoundeth with majesty. 
The voice of the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars; yea, the Lord shivereth the cedars of Lebanon; 
And he maketh them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Siryon like young reems. 
The voice of the Lord heweth out flames of fire. 
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
The voice of the Lord causeth the hinds to start, and maketh bare forests: and in his temple every thing speaketh of his glory. 
The Lord sat enthroned at the flood: and the Lord will sit as King for ever. 
The Lord will give strength unto his people: the Lord will bless his people with peace.
