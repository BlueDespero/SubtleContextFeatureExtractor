Psalms.
Chapter 93.
The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with excellency; the Lord is clothed, he hath girded himself with strength: therefore also the world is firmly established, that it cannot be moved. 
Firmly established is thy throne from the beginning: from everlasting art thou God. 
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voice; the rivers lift up their waves. 
But more than the noise of great waters, than the mighty billows of the sea, is the Lord excellent on high. 
Thy testimonies are exceedingly steadfast: in thy house abideth holiness, O Lord! to the utmost length of days.
