Psalms.
Chapter 23.
“A psalm of David.” The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. 
In pastures of tender grass he causeth me to lie down: beside still waters he leadeth me. 
My soul he refresheth: he guideth me in the tracks of righteousness for the sake of his name. 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff—they indeed comfort me. 
Thou preparest before me a table in the presence of my assailants; thou anointest with oil my head: my cup overfloweth. 
Surely, only goodness and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life: and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord to the utmost length of days.
