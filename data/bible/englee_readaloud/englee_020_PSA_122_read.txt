Psalms.
Chapter 122.
“A song of the degrees by David.” I was rejoiced when they said unto me, Unto the house of the Lord let us go. 
Our feet are now standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem! 
Jerusalem, which art built as a city wherein all associate together. 
For thither go up the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. 
For there are placed chairs for giving judgment, the chairs for the house of David.— 
Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem; may those that love thee prosper. 
May there be peace within thy walls, prosperity within thy palaces, 
For the sake of my brethren and my friends, let me now speak, Peace be within thee. 
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, will I seek thy good.
