Daniel.
Chapter 12.
And at that time will Michael, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people, stand forth; and there will be a time of distress, such as hath never been since the existence of any nation, until that same time; and at that time shall thy people be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. 
And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to disgrace and everlasting abhorrence. 
And the intelligent shall shine brilliantly like the brilliance of the expanse of the sky; and they that bring many to righteousness shall be like the stars, for ever and ever. 
But thou, O Daniel, close up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end: many will roam about, yet shall knowledge be increased. 
Then I Daniel looked, and behold, there were two others standing, the one on this side of the bank of the stream, and the other on that side of the bank of the stream. 
And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? 
Then heard I the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and swore by the Everliving One that after a time, times, and a half, and when there shall be an end to the crushing of the power of the holy people, all these things shall be ended. 
And I heard indeed, but I understood it not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the end of these things? 
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. 
Many shall be selected and cleansed, and purified; but the wicked will deal wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand: but the intelligent will understand. 
And from the time that the continual sacrifice will be removed, even to set up the desolating abomination, there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. 
Happy is he that waiteth, and attaineth to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. 
But thou, go thy way toward the end; and thou shalt rest, and arise again for thy lot at the end of the days.
