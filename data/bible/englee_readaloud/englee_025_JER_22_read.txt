Jeremiah.
Chapter 22.
Thus said the Lord, Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word; 
And thou shalt say, Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates: 
Thus hath said the Lord, Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor; and the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow shall ye not oppress, and do them no violence, and shed no innocent blood in this place. 
For if ye indeed will do this thing, then shall enter in through the gates of this house kings sitting after David upon his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
But if ye will not hear these words, then do I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a ruin. 
For thus hath said the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah, A Gil'ad though thou art unto me, a summit of the Lebanon: yet I will surely change thee into a wilderness, cities which are not inhabited. 
And I will make ready against thee destroyers, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down the choice of thy cedars, and cast them into the fire. 
And when many nations then pass by this city, they will say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath the Lord done the like unto this great city? 
Then shall they say, Because they had forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and bowed down unto other gods, and served them. 
Weep not for the dead, and do not bemoan him: weep sorely for him that goeth away; for he shall never return any more, and see the land of his birth. 
For thus hath said the Lord respecting Shallum the son of Josiah the king of Judah, who reigneth in the place of Josiah his father, who is gone forth out of this place, He shall never return thither any more; 
But in the place whither they have led him into exile, there shall he die; but this land shall he not see any more. 
Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that maketh his neighbor work without wages, and giveth him not the reward for his labor; 
That saith, I will build me a roomy house, and ample chambers, and cutteth himself out windows, and ceileth it with cedar, and painteth it with colors. 
Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel with cedar buildings? behold, thy father ate and drank, but he executed justice and righteousness: then was it well with him! 
He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then was it well: is not this the proper knowledge of me? saith the Lord. 
But thy eyes and thy heart are directed on nothing but upon thy own gain, and upon innocent blood to shed it, and upon oppression, and upon extortion, to practise them. 
Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, They shall not lament for him, with, “Woe, my brother!” and, “Woe, sister!” they shall not lament for him, with “Woe, lord!” and, “Woe, to his glory!” 
With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, dragged about and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. 
Ascend the Lebanon, and cry aloud; and let thy voice resound in Bashan; and cry aloud from 'Aharim; for crushed are all thy lovers. 
I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy very youth, that thou didst not hearken to my voice. 
The wind shall scatter abroad all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded because of all thy wickedness. 
O inhabitress of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how full of grace wilt thou be !!when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! 
As I live, saith the Lord, though Conyahu the son of Jehoyakim the king of Judah were a signet upon my right hand, yet for a surety would I thence pluck thee; 
And I will give thee into the hand of those that seek thy life, and into the hand of those of whom thou art afraid, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
And I will hurl thee out, and thy mother that hath born thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. 
But to the land whitherward they direct their soul to return, thither shall they not return. 
Is this man Conyahu a despised broken image? or a vessel without value? wherefore are they hurled out, he and his seed, and are cast forth into a land which they know not? 
O land, land, land! hear the word of the Lord. 
Thus hath said the Lord, Write ye down this man as childless, as a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall succeed to sit upon the throne of David, and to rule any more in Judah.
