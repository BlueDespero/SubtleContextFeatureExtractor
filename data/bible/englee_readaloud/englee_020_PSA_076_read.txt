Psalms.
Chapter 76.
“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm or song of Assaph.” (76:2) In Judah hath God been made known: in Israel is his name great. 
(76:3) And in Salem was his tabernacle made, and his dwelling-place in Zion. 
(76:4) There broke he the shining arrows of the bow, shield, and sword, and battle. Selah. 
(76:5) Thou art more brilliant, more excellent than the mountains full of prey. 
(76:6) Bereft of reason are the stouthearted, they slumber their sleep: and none of the men of might have found the use of their hands. 
(76:7) From thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, lie in deep sleep both chariot and horse. 
(76:8) Thou—thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thy anger is kindled? 
(76:9) From heaven hast thou caused thy sentence to be heard: the earth feared, and became still, 
(76:10) When God rose to judgment, to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah. 
(76:11) For the fury of man shall praise thee: the remainder of the fury wilt thou gird about thee. 
(76:12) Make vows, and pay them unto the Lord your God, all ye that are round about him: let men bring presents unto him that exciteth fear. 
(76:13) He will cut down the spirit of the powerful: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
