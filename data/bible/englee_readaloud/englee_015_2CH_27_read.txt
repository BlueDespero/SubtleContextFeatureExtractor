2 Chronicles.
Chapter 27.
Twenty and five years old was Jotham when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that his father 'Uzziyahu had done: only he entered not into the temple of the Lord. But the people acted still corruptly. 
He it was that built the upper gate of the house of the Lord, and on the wall of the hill-fort he built much. 
Moreover he built cities in the mountain of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 
And he likewise fought with the king of the sons of 'Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of 'Ammon gave him in that same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of 'Ammon pay unto him again, both in the second year, and in the third. 
So Jotham became strong; because he directed his ways before the Lord his God. 
And the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
Five and twenty years old was he when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem. 
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Achaz his son became king in his stead.
