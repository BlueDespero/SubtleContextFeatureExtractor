Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Hallelujah. Praise, O my soul, the Lord. 
I will praise the Lord throughout my life: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 
Put not your trust in princes, in the son of man, in whom there is no salvation. 
When his spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his native earth: on that very day perish his thoughts. 
But happy is he who hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is on the Lord his God; 
Who hath made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever; 
Who executeth justice for the oppressed: who giveth bread to the hungry: the Lord looseneth the prisoners; 
The Lord causeth the blind to see; the Lord raiseth up those who are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous: 
The Lord guardeth the strangers; the fatherless and widow he helpeth up; but the way of the wicked he maketh crooked. 
The Lord will reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.
