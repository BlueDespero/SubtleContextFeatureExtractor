Psalms.
Chapter 20.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (20:2) May the Lord answer thee on the day of distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee; 
(20:3) May he send thee help from the sanctuary, and support thee from Zion; 
(20:4) May he remember all thy meat-offerings, and accept in favor thy burnt-sacrifice. Selah. 
(20:5) May he grant thee according to thy own heart, and fulfill all thy resolves. 
(20:6) We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God will we upraise our banners: may the Lord fulfill all thy petitions. 
(20:7) Now I know that the Lord saveth his anointed: he will answer him from his holy heavens, with the saving strength of his right hand. 
(20:8) Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will invoke the name of the Lord our God. 
(20:9) They are prostrate and fallen; but we are risen up and stand erect. 
(20:10) O Lord, save us: may the king answer us on the day when we call on him.
