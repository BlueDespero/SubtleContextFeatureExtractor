Exodus.
Chapter 14.
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hachiroth, between Migdol and the sea; in front of Baal-zephon; opposite to this shall ye encamp by the sea. 
And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 
And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, that he shall follow after them; and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord; and they did so. 
And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed with respect to the people, and they said, What is this which we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him. 
And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand. 
And the Egyptians pursued after them, and they overtook them encamping by the sea, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, beside Pi-hachiroth, before Baal-zephon. 
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. 
And they said unto Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt, that thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness? what is this which thou hast done to us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? 
Is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness. 
And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will do for you today; for as ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall not see them again any more for ever. 
The Lord will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward; 
But do thou lift up thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry ground. 
And I, behold, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen. 
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have got myself honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen. 
And the angel of God, that went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them; 
And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to the first, but it gave light by night to these: and the one came not near unto the other all the night. 
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them, on their right hand, and on their left. 
And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, to the midst of the sea. 
And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the Lord looked unto the camp of the Egyptians with the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and brought into confusion the camp of the Egyptians; 
And he took off the wheels of their chariots, and caused them to move onward with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and the waters shall return over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their horsemen. 
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned, when the morning appeared, to its strength; while the Egyptians were fleeing against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen with all the host of Pharaoh that came after them into the sea: there remained of them not even one. 
But the children of Israel walked upon dry ground in the midst of the sea; and the waters were unto them a wall on their right hand, and on their left. 
Thus the Lord saved Israel on that day out of the land of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore of the sea. 
And Israel saw that great power which the Lord had shown on the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and then believed in the Lord, and in Moses his servant.
