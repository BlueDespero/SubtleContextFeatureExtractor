Ezekiel.
Chapter 39.
But thou, O son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal; 
And I will derange thee, and lead thee astray, and will cause thee to come up from the farthest ends of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel; 
And I will strike thy bow out of thy left hand, and thy arrows will I cause to fall out of thy right hand. 
Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou, and all thy armies, and the people that are with thee: unto the ravenous birds, to every thing that hath wings, and to the beasts of the field, do I give thee for food. 
Upon the open field shalt thou fall; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And I will send a fire against Magog, and against those that dwell in the isles in safety: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not permit my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, Holy in Israel. 
Behold, it cometh, and it taketh place, saith the Lord Eternal; this is the day whereof I have spoken. 
And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall burn and make fire for heating of the weapons, and shields and bucklers, of bows and of arrows, and of hand-staves, and of spears; and they shall feed with them the fire for seven years; 
And they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests; for with weapons shall they feed the fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there for a grave in Israel, the valley where people pass over to the east of the sea; and it shall stop the passengers from passing: and they shall bury there Gog and all his multitude, and they shall call it The valley of the multitude of Gog. 
And the house of Israel shall be burying them, in order to cleanse the land, during seven months. 
Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them as a renown on the day that I glorify myself, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And men constantly devoted to this shall they set apart to pass through the land, to bury with those that pass through those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it; at the end of seven months shall they make a search. 
And those that thus travel will pass through the land; and when any one seeth a human bone, then will he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog. 
And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land. 
And thou, O son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Say unto the birds, to every thing that hath wings, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from every side to my sacrifice that I do slaughter for you, as a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. 
The flesh of the mighty shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink,—wethers, lambs, and he-goats, bullocks, fatlings of Bashan are they all of them. 
And ye shall eat fat till ye be sated, and ye shall drink blood till ye be drunken, from my sacrifice which I have slaughtered for you. 
And ye shall be sated at my table on horses and chariot-teams, on mighty men, and on all men of war, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And I will display my glory among the nations: and all the nations shall see my punishment that I execute, and my hand that I lay on them. 
And the house of Israel shall acknowledge that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward. 
And the nations shall know that for their iniquity did the house of Israel go into exile; because they had trespassed against me, and I had hidden my face from them; and I gave them up therefore into the hand of their oppressors, and they all fell by the sword. 
According to their uncleanness, and according to their transgressions did I deal with them, and hid my face from them. 
Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Now will I bring back again the captivity of Jacob, and I will have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be zealous for my holy name; 
And they shall feel their disgrace, and all their trespass whereby they had trespassed against me, when they dwelt in their land in safety, with none to make them afraid: 
When I bring them back again from the people, and gather them out of the land of their enemies, and sanctify myself on them before the eyes of the many nations. 
And they shall know that I am the Lord their God; because I had exiled them among the nations, but gather them now unto their own land, and leave none of them any more there. 
And I will not hide my face any more from them; for I will have poured out my spirit over the house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal.
