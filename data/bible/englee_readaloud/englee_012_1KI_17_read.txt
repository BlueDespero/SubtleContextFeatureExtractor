1 Kings.
Chapter 17.
Then said Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gil'ad, unto Achab, As the Lord the God of Israel liveth, before whom I have stood, there shall not be in these years dew or rain, except according to my word. 
And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, 
Go away from here, and turn thyself eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Kerith, which is to the east of the Jordan. 
And it shall be, that out of the brook shalt thou drink; and the ravens have I ordained to sustain thee there. 
And he went and did according to the word of the Lord; and he went and remained by the brook Kerith, that is to the east of the Jordan. 
And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening: and out of the brook he used to drink. 
And it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up; because there had been no rain in the land. 
And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, 
Arise, go unto Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and remain there: behold, I have ordained there a widow-woman to sustain thee. 
So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, there was there a widow-woman gathering sticks of wood: and he called her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
And as she went to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand. 
And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have nothing baked, but a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a cruise: and, behold, I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for me and my son; and when we have eaten it, we shall have to die. 
And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake at first, and bring it out unto me, and for thee and for thy son shalt thou prepare something afterward. 
For thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not fail, neither shall the cruise of oil diminish, until the day that the Lord giveth rain upon the face of the earth. 
And she went and did according to the word of Elijah: and she, and he, and her household, did eat many days. 
The jar of meal failed not, nor did the cruise of oil diminish, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken through means of Elijah. 
And it came to pass after these events, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness became very severe, until that at length there was no breath left in him. 
And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O man of God? thou art come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son! 
And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, in which he abode, and he laid him upon his own bed. 
And he called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
And he stretched himself out over the child three times, and called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray thee, the soul of this child return again within him. 
And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah: and the soul of the child returned into him, and he revived. 
And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and gave him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 
And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this do I know, that thou art a man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.
