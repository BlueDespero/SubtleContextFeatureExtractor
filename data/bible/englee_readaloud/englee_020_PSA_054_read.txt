Psalms.
Chapter 54.
“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a Maskil of David, (54:2) When the Ziphim came and said to Saul, Behold, David is hiding himself with us.” (54:3) O God, by thy name save me, and by thy strength grant me justice. 
(54:4) O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
(54:5) For strangers to goodness are risen up against me, and powerful oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 
(54:6) Behold, God is a helper unto me: the Lord is among those that uphold my soul. 
(54:7) He will cause the evil to return upon those that regard me with envy: in thy truth cut them off. 
(54:8) I will liberally sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Lord; for it is good. 
(54:9) For out of all distress hath he delivered me: and my eye hath seen its desire on my enemies.
