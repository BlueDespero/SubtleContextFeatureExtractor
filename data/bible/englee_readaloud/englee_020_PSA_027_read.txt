Psalms.
Chapter 27.
“Of David.” The Lord is my light and my salvation; of whom shall I be afraid? the Lord is the fortress of my life; of whom shall I have dread? 
When evil-doers come near against me to eat up my flesh, my assailants and my enemies at me: then do they stumble and fall. 
If an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: if war should arise against me, even then will I have trust. 
One thing have I asked of the Lord, that I will seek for: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the loveliness of the Lord, and to be every morning early in his temple. 
For he will hide me in his pavilion on the day of evil; he will conceal me in the secret of his tabernacle; upon a rock will he place me high. 
And now will my head be lifted up above my enemies all round about me; and I will sacrifice in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy: I will sing, and I will triumphantly play unto the Lord. 
Hear, O Lord, my voice, when I call, and be gracious unto me, and answer me. 
Of thee, said my heart, “Seek ye my presence”: thy presence, Lord, will I seek. 
Hide then not thy face from me; reject not in anger thy servant, thou who hast been my help: cast me not off, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
For my father and my mother have forsaken me; but the Lord will take me up. 
Point me out thy way, O Lord! and guide me on a level path, because of those that regard me enviously. 
Give me not up to the revengeful desire of my assailants; for there are risen up against me false witnesses, and such as utter violence. 
Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of life— 
Wait on the Lord; be strong, and let thy heart be of good courage; and only wait on the Lord.
