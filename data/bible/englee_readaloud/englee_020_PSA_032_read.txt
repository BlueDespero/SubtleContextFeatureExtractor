Psalms.
Chapter 32.
“Of David: a Maskil.” Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 
Happy is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my crying all the day. 
For by day and night lay thy hand heavily upon me: my life's moisture hath been changed through the droughts of summer. Selah. 
My sin do I ever acknowledge unto thee, and my iniquity have I not covered up. I said, I will make confession because of my transgressions unto the Lord: and thou truly forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
For this shall every pious one pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely then when great waters overflow, they shall never reach unto him. 
Thou art my hiding-place; from distress wilt thou preserve me; with songs of deliverance wilt thou encompass me. Selah. 
I will instruct thee and I will teach thee concerning the way which thou oughtest to go: I will counsel thee with my eye. 
Be ye not like the horse, or like the mule, who hath no understanding; who must be held in with bit and bridle, his ornament, lest he come near unto thee. 
Many are the pains of the wicked; but him that trusteth in the Lord will he encompass with kindness. 
Rejoice in the Lord, and be glad, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
