Leviticus.
Chapter 12.
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a male child: then shall she be unclean seven days, even as in the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. 
And on the eighth day shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised. 
And thirty and three days shall she then continue in the blood of her purification; any thing hallowed shall she not touch, and into the sanctuary shall she not come, until the days of her purification be at an end. 
But if she bear a female child, then shall she be unclean two weeks as in her separation; and sixty and six days shall she continue in the blood of the purification. 
And at the completion of the days of her purification, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a sheep of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest. 
And he shall bring it near before the Lord, and make an atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood: this is the law for her that hath given birth to a male or to a female. 
And if her means will not suffice for a lamb, then shall she take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
