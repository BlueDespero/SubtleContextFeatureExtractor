Psalms.
Chapter 65.
“To the chief musician, a psalm and song of David.” (65:2) For thee praise is waiting, O God, in Zion: and unto thee shall vows be paid. 
(65:3) O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee all flesh shall come. 
(65:4) The iniquitous things have become too mighty for me: our transgressions—these wilt thou wipe away. 
(65:5) Happy is he whom thou choosest, and causest to approach, that he may dwell in thy courts: let us be satisfied with the happiness of thy house, the holiness of thy temple. 
(65:6) With terrific deeds in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation, who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the sea, that are far away; 
(65:7) Who setteth firmly the mountains by his power, who is girded with might; 
(65:8) Who assuageth the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of nations. 
(65:9) And they that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of thy wondrous signs: the outgoings of the morning and evening thou causest to rejoice. 
(65:10) Thou hast thought of the earth, and waterest her abundantly; thou greatly enrichest her; the brook of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, when thou hast thus prepared her. 
(65:11) Watering her furrows abundantly, smoothing down her ridges, thou softenest her with showers; thou blessest her growth. 
(65:12) Thou hast crowned the year of thy goodness; and thy tracks drop fatness: 
(65:13) The pastures of the wilderness are dropping with plenty: and the hills are girt with gladness. 
(65:14) The meadows are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are enveloped with corn: men shout for joy, yea, they also sing.
