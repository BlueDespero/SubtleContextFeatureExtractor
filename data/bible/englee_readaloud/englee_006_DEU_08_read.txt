Deuteronomy.
Chapter 8.
All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do; in order that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord hath sworn unto your fathers. 
And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, in order to afflict thee, to prove thee, to know what is in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not. 
And he afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and he gave thee manna to eat, which thou knewest not, and which thy fathers had not known; in order that he might make thee know that not by bread alone man doth live, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live. 
Thy garment did not fall worn out from thee, and thy foot did not swell, these forty years. 
And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so doth the Lord thy God chasten thee. 
And thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and mountains; 
A land of wheat, and barley, and of the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate; a land of the oil-olive, and of honey; 
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, wherein thou shalt not lack anything; a land the stones whereof are iron, and out of the mountains of which thou canst hew copper. 
And when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, then shalt thou bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. 
Take heed unto thyself that thou forget not the Lord thy God, so as not to keep his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day; 
That when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 
And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied: 
Thy heart be then not lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery; 
Who hath led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein are snakes, poisonous serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there is no water; who hath brought forth for thee water out of the flinty rock; 
Who hath fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; in order to afflict thee, and in order to prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; 
And thou say in thy heart, My power and the strength of my hand have gotten me this wealth. 
But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; in order that he might fulfill his covenant which he hath sworn unto thy fathers, as it is this day. 
And it shall come to pass, that, if thou shouldst forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and bow thyself down to them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish; 
Like the nations which the Lord destroyeth from before you, so shall ye perish; in recompense of that ye would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God.
