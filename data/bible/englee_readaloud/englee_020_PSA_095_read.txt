Psalms.
Chapter 95.
O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. 
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and shout joyfully unto him with psalms. 
For a great God is the Lord, and a great King above all Gods; 
In whose hand are the deep places of the earth; and whose are the heights of mountains; 
Whose is the sea, and who hath made it; and whose hands have formed the dry land. 
Oh come, let us prostrate ourselves and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. 
For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the flock of his hand: yea, this day, if ye will hearken to his voice, 
Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as on the day of the temptation in the wilderness: 
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, although they had seen my doing. 
Forty years long did I feel loathing on that generation, and I said, It is a people of an erring heart; and they truly acknowledged not my ways: 
So that I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
