Psalms.
Chapter 12.
“To the chief musician upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.” (12:2) Help, O Lord; for the pious have ceased to be; for the truthful have failed from among the children of men. 
(12:3) Deceptively do they speak every one with his neighbor, with flattering lips, with a double heart do they speak. 
(12:4) May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh boastful things: 
(12:5) Who have said, With our tongue will we be mighty; our lips are with us; who is Lord over us! 
(12:6) Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord: I will grant safety to him for whom the other layeth a snare. 
(12:7) The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver refined in the crucible of earth, purified seven times. 
(12:8) Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve them; thou wilt guard them from this generation for ever. 
(12:9) On every side do the wicked walk about, when the vile are exalted over the sons of man.
