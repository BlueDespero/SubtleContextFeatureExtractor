Psalms.
Chapter 13.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (13:2) How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me continually! how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
(13:3) How long shall I have to devise resolves in my soul, with grief in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy exalt himself over me? 
(13:4) Look down, answer me, O Lord my God! enlighten my eyes, that I may not sleep the sleep of death; 
(13:5) That my enemy may not say, I have overcome him; that my assailants may not be glad when I am moved. 
(13:6) But I trust in thy kindness, let my heart be glad because of thy salvation: 
I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
