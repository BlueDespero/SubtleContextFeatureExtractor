Psalms.
Chapter 100.
“A psalm of thanksgiving.” Shout joyfully unto the Lord, all ye lands. 
Serve the Lord with joy; come before his presence with triumphal song. 
Know, that the Lord is God indeed: it is he that hath made us, and his are we—his people and the flock of his pasture. 
Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, bless his name. 
For the Lord is good; to eternity endureth his kindness; and unto the latest generation his truth.
