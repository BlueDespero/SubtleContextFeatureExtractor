Genesis.
Chapter 27.
And it came to pass, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 
And he said, Behold now, I am grown old, I know not the day of my death: 
Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt for me some venison; 
And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 
And Rebekah heard as Isaac was speaking to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death. 
And now, my son, obey my voice in that which I command thee. 
Go, I pray thee, to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids; and I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth: 
And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat; for the sake that he may bless thee before his death. 
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 
Peradventure my father will feel me, and I shall then seem to him as a deceiver; and I would bring upon me a curse, and not a blessing. 
And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch them to me. 
And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved. 
And Rebekah took the goodly garments of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and clothed therewith Jacob her younger son; 
And the skins of the kids she put upon his hands, and upon the smooth part of his neck; 
And she gave the savory food and bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of Jacob her son. 
And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou my son? 
And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done as thou didst speak to me: arise I pray thee, sit here and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it before me. 
And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be truly my son Esau or not. 
And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father, and he felt him; and he said, The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
And he recognized him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 
And he said, Art thou indeed my son Esau? and he said I am. 
And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat, and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
And Isaac his father said unto him, Come near, I pray thee, and kiss me, my son. 
And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is the smell of the field which the Lord hath blessed. 
And may God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine; 
Nations shall serve thee, and people bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and thy mother's sons shall bow down to thee; cursed be they that curse thee, and blessed be they that bless thee. 
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, in order that thy soul may bless me. 
And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau. 
And Isaac trembled greatly, exceedingly, and said, Who was it? where is he that had hunted venison, and brought it me, and I ate of all before thou camest, and blessed him? yea, he shall also remain blessed. 
When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, also me, my father. 
And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and took away thy blessing. 
And he said, Hath he been therefore named Jacob, because he hath supplanted me these two times? my right of first-born he took away; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing: and he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me. 
And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I endowed him: and what can I do now for thee, my son. 
And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou then but one blessing, my father? bless me, also me, my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and blessed by the dew of heaven from above; 
And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thy brother shalt thou serve; and it shall come to pass, that when thou shalt have the dominion, thou canst break his yoke from off thy neck. 
And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father will be at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 
And Rebekah was informed of the words of Esau her elder son: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau doth comfort himself, with regard to thee, purposing to kill thee. 
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother, to Charan; 
And tarry with him a short time, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then will I send, and fetch thee from there; why should I be deprived of both of you at once in one day? 
And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife from the daughters of Heth, such as these, from the daughters of the land, what good will life do me?
