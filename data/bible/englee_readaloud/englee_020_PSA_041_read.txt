Psalms.
Chapter 41.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (41:2) Happy is he that careth for the poor: on the day of evil will the Lord deliver him. 
(41:3) The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; he shall be made happy on the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the revengeful desire of his enemies. 
(41:4) The Lord will sustain him upon the bed of painful disease: thou changest all his couch in his sickness. 
(41:5) I said, Lord, be gracious unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. 
(41:6) My enemies speak evil of me, When will he die, and his name perish? 
(41:7) And if he come to see me, he speaketh falsely: his heart gathereth wickedness to itself; he goeth abroad and speaketh it. 
(41:8) Altogether whisper against me all that hate me: against me do they devise my injury. 
(41:9) “His godless deed say they is poured out over him: as he lieth there he will never more rise up again.” 
(41:10) Yea, even the man that should have sought my welfare, in whom I trusted, who eateth my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. 
(41:11) But thou, O Lord, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite it unto them. 
(41:12) By this do I know that thou art pleased with me, that my enemy doth not triumph over me. 
(41:13) But as for me, thou upholdest me in my integrity, and placest me before thy presence for ever. 
(41:14) Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. BEGIM
