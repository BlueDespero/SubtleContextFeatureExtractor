Psalms.
Chapter 132.
“A song of the degrees.” Remember, O Lord, unto David all his afflictions; 
How he swore unto the Lord; how he vowed unto the mighty One of Jacob: 
Surely, I will not enter into the tent of my house, nor ascend the couch of my repose; 
I will not grant any sleep to my eyes, nor to my eyelids any slumber: 
Until I shall have found out a place for the Lord, a dwelling-place for the mighty One of Jacob. 
“Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we met with it in the fields of the forest: 
let us then go into his dwelling: let us prostrate ourselves before his footstool.” 
Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy pious servants shout for joy. 
For the sake of David thy servant turn not away the face of thy anointed. 
The Lord hath sworn unto David in truth; he will not turn from it: “From the fruit of thy body will I set some one on the throne to succeed thee. 
If thy children will observe my covenant and this my testimony which I teach them: then also shall their children sit for evermore upon the throne to succeed thee.” 
For the Lord hath made choice of Zion: he hath desired it as a habitation for himself. 
This is my resting-place for evermore: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
Her provision will I bless abundantly: her needy ones will I satisfy with bread. 
And her priests will I clothe with salvation: and her pious ones shall shout aloud for joy. 
There will I cause to grow a horn unto David: I arrange a lamp for my anointed. 
His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine brilliantly.
