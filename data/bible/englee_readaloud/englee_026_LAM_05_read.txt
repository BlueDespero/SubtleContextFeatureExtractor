Lamentations.
Chapter 5.
Remember, O Lord, what hath occurred to us, look down, and behold our disgrace. 
Our inheritance is turned over to strangers, our houses to aliens. 
Orphans are we become, and we are without a father, our mothers are like widows. 
Our water have we drunk for money: our wood cometh to us for a purchase price. 
Up to our necks are we pursued: we are fatigued, and no rest is allowed us. 
To Egypt do we stretch out our hand, to Asshur, to be satisfied with bread. 
Our fathers have sinned, and are no more; but we have indeed to bear their iniquities. 
Servants rule over us: no one delivereth us out of their hand. 
At the peril of our life must we bring home our bread, because of the sword of the wilderness. 
Our skin gloweth like an oven, because of the heat of famine. 
Women have they ravished in Zion, virgins, in the cities of Judah. 
Princes were hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honored. 
Young men they bore to the mill, and boys stumbled under the wood. 
The elders have ceased from the gate, young men, from their singing. 
Ceased hath the joy of our heart: our dance is changed into mourning. 
Fallen is the crown of our head: woe to us, for we have sinned. 
Because of this is our heart made sick; for these things are our eyes dimmed; 
Because of the mount of Zion which is wasted, foxes walk about on it. 
O thou, Lord, wilt truly abide for ever, thy throne existeth throughout all generations. 
Wherefore wilt thou forget us for ever! wilt thou forsake us for so long a time? 
Cause us to return, O Lord, unto thee, and we will return: renew our days as of old. 
For wouldst thou entirely reject us, be wroth with us to the uttermost?
