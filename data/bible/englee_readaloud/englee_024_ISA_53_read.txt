Isaiah.
Chapter 53.
Who would have believed our report? and the arm of the Lord—over whom hath it been revealed? 
Yea, he grew up like a small shoot before him, and as a root out of a dry land: he had no form nor comeliness, so that we should look at him; and no countenance, so that we should desire him. 
He was despised and shunned by men; a man of pains, and acquainted with disease; and as one who hid his face from us was he despised, and we esteemed him not. 
But only our diseases did he bear himself, and our pains he carried: while we indeed esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 
Yet he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement for our peace was upon him; and through his bruises was healing granted to us. 
We all like sheep went astray; every one to his own way did we turn; and the Lord let befall him the guilt of us all. 
He was oppressed, and he was also taunted, yet he opened not his mouth; like the lamb which is led to the slaughter, and like an ewe before her shearers is dumb; and he opened not his mouth. 
Through oppression and through judicial punishment was he taken away; but his generation—who could tell, that he was cut away out of the land of life, that for the transgressions of my people the plague was laid on him? 
And he let his grave be made with the wicked, and with the godless rich at his death; although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. 
But the Lord was pleased to crush him through disease: when now his soul hath brought the trespass-offering, then shall he see his seed, live many days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. 
Freed from the trouble of his soul shall he see the good and be satisfied: through his knowledge shall my righteous servant bring the many to righteousness, while he will bear their iniquities. 
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the many, and with the strong shall he divide the spoil; because he poured out his soul unto death, and with transgressors was he numbered: while he bore the sin of many, and for the transgressors he let evil befall him.
