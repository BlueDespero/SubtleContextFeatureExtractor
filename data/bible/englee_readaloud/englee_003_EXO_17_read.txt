Exodus.
Chapter 17.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeyings, by the order of the Lord; and they encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink. 
And the people quarrelled with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink; and Moses said unto them, Why will ye quarrel with me? why will ye tempt the Lord? 
And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, For what purpose is it that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill me and my children and my cattle with thirst? 
And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? but little is wanting and they will stone me. 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee some of the elders of Israel; and thy staff, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. 
Behold, I will be standing before thee there upon the rock at Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come out from it water, and the people shall drink; and Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. 
And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah; because of the quarrelling of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is then the Lord among us, or not? 
Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand. 
And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Chur went up to the top of the hill. 
And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, that Amalek prevailed. 
But when the hands of Moses became heavy, they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Chur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens. 
And Moses built an altar, and called its name Adonay Nissy The Lord is my Banner. 
And he said, Because the Lord hath sworn on his throne, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
