Psalms.
Chapter 133.
“A song of the degrees by David.” Behold, how good and how pleasant it is !!when brethren dwell closely together in union! 
It is like the precious oil upon the head, running down upon the beard, yea, Aaron's beard, which runneth down upon the upper border of his garments; 
Like the dew of Chermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion; for there hath the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
