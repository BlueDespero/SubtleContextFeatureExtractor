Proverbs.
Chapter 27.
Make no boast for thyself of the coming day; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 
Let another man praise thee, and not thy own mouth; a stranger, and not thy own lips. 
A stone hath heaviness, and the sand, weight; but a fool's wrath is heavier than both of them. 
Fury hath its cruelty, and anger its overwhelming power; but who is able to stand before jealousy? 
Better is open reproof than concealed love. 
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but deceptive are the kisses of an enemy. 
The satisfied soul treadeth under foot fine honey; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 
As a bird that wandereth away from her nest, so is a man that wandereth away from his place. 
Oil and perfume cause the heart to rejoice, and so do the sweet words of a friend more than one's own counsel. 
Thy own friend, and thy father's friend, thou must not forsake; but into thy brother's house enter not on the day of thy calamity: better is a near neighbor than a distant brother. 
Become wise, my son, and cause my heart to rejoice, that I may give an answer to him that reproacheth me. 
The prudent foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. 
Take his garment, for he became surety for a stranger; and on account of an alien woman take a pledge of him. 
When one saluteth his friend with a loud voice, when rising early in the morning, it will be counted a curse to him. 
A continual dropping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. 
He that would conceal her might conceal the wind, and as fragrant oil on his right hand, which would betray itself. 
Iron is sharpened by iron: so doth a man sharpen himself on the countenance of his friend. 
Whoso guardeth the fig-tree will eat its fruit: so he that watcheth over his master will be honored. 
As the water showeth to the face the reflected face: so doth the heart of man show itself to man. 
The nether world and the place of corruption are never satisfied: so are the eyes of man never satisfied. 
As the fining-pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: so is a man proved according to his praise. 
Though thou shouldst pound the fool in a mortar, in the midst of grains of wheat with a pestle: still would his folly not depart from him. 
Endeavor to know well the appearance of thy flocks, direct thy attention to thy herds; 
For property endureth not for ever, nor doth the crown remain for all generations. 
When the grass is past, young verdure showeth itself, and then are gathered the herbs of the mountains. 
The sheep are for thy clothing, and he-goats are the purchase-price of a field. 
And thou wilt have enough of goats' milk for thy food, for the food of thy household, and the support for thy maidens.
