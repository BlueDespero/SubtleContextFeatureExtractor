Job.
Chapter 25.
Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said, 
Dominion and dread are with him: he maketh peace in high places. 
Can the number of his hosts be given? and over whom riseth not his light? 
How then can man be justified with God? or how can be one that is born of woman? 
Behold, even as regardeth the moon, that is not bright; yea, the stars are not pure in his eyes. 
How much less the mortal, the mere worm? and the son of earth, the mere maggot?
