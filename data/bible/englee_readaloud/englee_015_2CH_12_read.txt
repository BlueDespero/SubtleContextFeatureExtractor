2 Chronicles.
Chapter 12.
And it came to pass, when Rehobo'am had established the kingdom, and when he had become strong, that he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him. 
And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehobo'am, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,—because they had acted faithlessly against the Lord,— 
With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen: and innumerable were the people that came with him out of Egypt—the Lubim, the Sukkiyim, and the Ethiopians. 
And he captured the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and he came as far as Jerusalem. 
And Shem'ayah the prophet came to Rehobo'am, and the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, Ye have indeed forsaken me, and therefore have I also relinquished you into the hand of Shishak. 
Thereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The Lord is righteous. 
And when the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, then came the word of the Lord to Shem'ayah, saying, “They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will permit some little to escape from them; and my wrath shall not be poured out over Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.” 
However they shall be servants unto him, and they shall know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the various countries. 
And so came up Shishak the king of Egypt against Jerusalem, and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house: every thing did he take away; and he took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
And king Rehobo'am made in their stead shields of copper, and committed them for keeping into the hand of the chiefs of the runners, who kept guard at the door of the king's house. 
And it happened whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, that the runners came and bore them, and carried them back into the apartment of the runners. 
And when he had humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, so that he destroyed him not to make an end of him: and also in Judah were some good things found. 
And king Rehobo'am strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned; for Rehobo'am was one and forty years old when he became king, and seventeen years did he reign in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Na'amah the 'Ammonitess. 
And he did the evil; because he directed not his heart to seek the Lord. 
And the acts of Rehobo'am, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Shem'ayah the prophet, and of 'Iddo, the seer concerning the genealogies. And the wars of Rehobo'am and Jerobo'am lasted all the days. 
And Rehobo'am slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abiyah his son became king in his stead.
