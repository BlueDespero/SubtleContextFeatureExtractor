Isaiah.
Chapter 39.
At that time sent Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had been sick, and was become strong again. 
And Hezekiah was rejoiced on their account, and showed them his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the whole of his armor-house, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing that Hezekiah showed them not, in his house, and in all his dominion. 
Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What did these men say? and whence did they come unto thee? And Hezekiah said, From a far-off country are they come unto me, from Babylon. 
And he said, What did they see in thy house? And Hezekiah said, all that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing that I did not show them in my treasures. 
And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts, 
Behold, days are coming when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord. 
And of thy sons that will issue from thee, whom thou wilt beget, shall they take; and they shall be court-servants in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and stability in my days.
