Jeremiah.
Chapter 45.
The word which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriyah, when he wrote these words in a book out of the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, saying, 
Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch: 
Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the Lord hath added grief to my pain; I am wearied in my sighing, and rest have I not found; 
Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus hath the Lord said, Behold, what I have built will I pull down, and what I have planted I will pluck up; and so it is with this whole land. 
And wouldst thou indeed seek great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord; but I will give thy life unto thee as a booty in all the places whither thou mayest go.
