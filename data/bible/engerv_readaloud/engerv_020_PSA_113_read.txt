Psalm.
Chapter 113.
Praise the LORD! Servants of the LORD, praise him! Praise the LORD’S name. 
May the LORD’S name be praised now and forever. 
May the LORD’S name be praised from where the sun rises to where it goes down. 
The LORD is higher than all nations. His glory rises to the skies. 
There is no one like the LORD our God. He sits on his throne high in heaven. 
He is so high above us that he must look down to see the sky and the earth. 
He lifts the poor out of the dirt and rescues beggars from the garbage dump. 
He puts them in important positions, giving them a place among the leaders of his people. 
He gives children to the woman whose home is empty. He makes her a happy mother. Praise the LORD!
