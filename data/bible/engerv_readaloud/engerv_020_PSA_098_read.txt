Psalm.
Chapter 98.
A song of praise. Sing a new song to the LORD, because he has done amazing things! His powerful and holy right arm has brought him another victory. 
The LORD showed the nations his power to save. He showed them his goodness. 
He has kept his promise of love and loyalty to the people of Israel. People everywhere have seen our God’s power to save. 
Everyone on earth, shout with joy to the LORD. Start singing happy songs of praise! 
Praise the LORD with harps. Yes, praise him with music from the harps. 
Blow the pipes and horns, and shout for joy to the LORD our King! 
Let the sea and everything in it, the earth and all who live in it shout his praise! 
Rivers, clap your hands! All together now, mountains sing out! 
Sing before the LORD because he is coming to judge the world. He will rule the world fairly. He will rule the people with goodness.
