Psalm.
Chapter 62.
To the director, Jeduthun. A song of David. I must calm down and turn to God; only he can rescue me. 
He is my Rock, the only one who can save me. He is my high place of safety, where no army can defeat me. 
How long will you people attack me? Do you all want to kill me? I am like a leaning wall, like a fence ready to fall. 
You want only to destroy me, to bring me down from my important position. It makes you happy to tell lies about me. In public, you say nice things, but in private, you curse me. Selah 
I must calm down and turn to God; he is my only hope. 
He is my Rock, the only one who can save me. He is my high place of safety, where no army can defeat me. 
My victory and honor come from God. He is the mighty Rock, where I am safe. 
People, always put your trust in God! Tell him all your problems. God is our place of safety. Selah 
People cannot really help. You cannot depend on them. Compared to God, they are nothing— no more than a gentle puff of air! 
Don’t trust in your power to take things by force. Don’t think you will gain anything by stealing. And if you become wealthy, don’t put your trust in riches. 
God says there is one thing you can really depend on, and I believe it: “Strength comes from God!” 
My Lord, your love is real. You reward all people for what they do.
