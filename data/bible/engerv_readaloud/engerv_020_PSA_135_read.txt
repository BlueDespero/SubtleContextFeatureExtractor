Psalm.
Chapter 135.
Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD! Praise him, you servants of the LORD, 
you who serve in the LORD’S Temple, in the courtyard of the Temple of our God. 
Praise the LORD, because he is good. Praise his name, because it brings such joy! 
The LORD chose Jacob to be his own. Yes, he chose Israel to be his own people. 
I know the LORD is great! Our Lord is greater than all the gods! 
The LORD does whatever he wants, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and the deep oceans. 
He brings the clouds from the other side of the earth. He sends the lightning and the rain, and he opens the doors to release the winds. 
He destroyed the firstborn males of the people in Egypt and their animals. 
He did great wonders and miracles in Egypt. He used them against Pharaoh and his officials. 
He defeated many nations and killed powerful kings. 
He defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms in Canaan. 
Then he gave their land to Israel, his people. 
LORD, your name will be famous forever! LORD, people will remember you forever and ever. 
The LORD defends his people; he is kind to his servants. 
The gods of other nations are only gold and silver idols that people have made. 
They have mouths, but cannot speak. They have eyes, but cannot see. 
They have ears, but cannot hear. They have mouths, but no breath. 
Those who make idols and trust in them will become just like the idols they have made. 
Family of Israel, praise the LORD! Aaron’s family, praise the LORD! 
Levi’s family, praise the LORD! All you who worship the LORD, praise the LORD! 
The LORD should be praised from Zion, from Jerusalem, his home. Praise the LORD!
