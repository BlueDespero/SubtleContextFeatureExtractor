Psalm.
Chapter 142.
A maskil of David written when he was in the cave. A prayer. I cry out to the LORD. I beg the LORD to help me. 
I tell him my problems; I tell him about my troubles. 
I am ready to give up. But you, Lord, know the path I am on, and you know that my enemies have set a trap for me. 
I look around, and I don’t see anyone I know. I have no place to run. There is no one to save me. 
LORD, I cry out to you for help: “You are my place of safety. You are all I need in life.” 
Listen to my prayer. I am so weak. Save me from those who are chasing me. They are stronger than I am. 
Help me escape this trap, so that I can praise your name. Then good people will celebrate with me, because you took care of me.
