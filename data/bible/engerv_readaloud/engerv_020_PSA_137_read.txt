Psalm.
Chapter 137.
We sat by the rivers in Babylon and cried as we remembered Zion. 
We hung our harps nearby, there on the willow trees. 
There in Babylon, those who captured us told us to sing. Our enemies told us to entertain them. They said, “Sing us one of your songs about Zion.” 
But we cannot sing the LORD’S songs in a foreign country! 
Jerusalem, if I ever forget you, may I never play a song again. 
If I fail to remember you, may I never sing again. I will always remember Jerusalem as my greatest joy! 
LORD, be sure to punish the Edomites for what they did when Jerusalem was captured. They shouted, “Destroy its buildings! Pull them down to the ground!” 
Babylon, you will be destroyed! Bless the one who pays you back for what you did to us. 
Bless the one who grabs your babies and smashes them against a rock.
