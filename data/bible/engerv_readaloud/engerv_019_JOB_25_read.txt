Job.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad from Shuah answered: 
“God is the ruler. He makes people fear and respect him. He keeps peace in his kingdom above. 
No one can count his stars. His sun rises on all people. 
How can anyone claim to be right before God? No human being can really be pure. 
In God’s eyes even the moon is not pure and bright; even the stars are not pure. 
People are much less pure. They are like maggots, as worthless as worms!”
