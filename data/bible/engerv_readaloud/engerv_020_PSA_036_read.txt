Psalm.
Chapter 36.
To the director: A song of David, the LORD’S servant. Deep in the hearts of the wicked a voice tells them to do wrong. They have no respect for God. 
They lie to themselves. They don’t see their own faults, so they are not sorry for what they do. 
Their words are wicked lies. They have stopped doing anything wise or good. 
They make wicked plans in bed at night. They choose a way of life that does no good. And they never say no to anything evil. 
LORD, your faithful love reaches to the sky. Your faithfulness is as high as the clouds. 
Your goodness is higher than the highest mountains. Your fairness is deeper than the deepest ocean. LORD, you protect people and animals. 
Nothing is more precious than your loving kindness. All people can find protection close to you. 
They get strength from all the good things in your house. You let them drink from your wonderful river. 
The fountain of life flows from you. Your light lets us see light. 
Continue to love those who really know you, and do good to those who are true to you. 
Don’t let proud people trap me. Don’t let the wicked force me to run away. 
Put this on their grave markers: “Here fell the wicked. They were crushed. They will never stand up again.”
