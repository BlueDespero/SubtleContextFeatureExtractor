Job.
Chapter 4.
Eliphaz from Teman answered: 
“I must say something. Would it upset you if I speak? 
Job, you have taught many people. You encouraged those who were ready to quit. 
Your words helped those who were ready to fall. You gave strength to those who could not stand by themselves. 
But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged. Trouble hits you, and you are upset. 
You worship God. You trust him. You are a good man, so let that be your hope. 
Can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed? Do you know of any place where good people are punished? 
Yes, I have seen people whose lives were cut short, but they were evil troublemakers. 
They lost the breath God gave them. They were cut off from his breath of life. 
They were like roaring lions, like growling lions with broken teeth— 
like a lioness that cannot find prey. They died, and their cubs starved to death. 
“I happened to hear a message. My ears caught a whisper of it. 
Like a bad dream in the night, it ruined my sleep. 
It frightened me, and I trembled down to my bones. 
A spirit passed by my face. The hair on my body stood up! 
The spirit stood still, but I could not see what it was. A shape stood before my eyes, and there was silence. Then I heard a quiet voice: 
‘A person cannot be more right than God. People cannot be more pure than their Maker. 
Look, God cannot even trust his heavenly servants. He sees faults even in his angels. 
So surely people are worse! They live in houses of clay built on dust. They can be crushed as easily as a moth! 
From dawn to sunset people are destroyed. They die—gone forever—and no one even notices. 
The ropes of their tent are pulled up, and they die before gaining wisdom.’
