Psalm.
Chapter 15.
A song of David. LORD, who can live in your Holy Tent? Who can live on your holy mountain? 
Only those who live pure lives, do what is right, and speak the truth from their hearts. 
Such people don’t say bad things about others. They don’t do things to hurt their neighbors. They don’t tell shameful things about those close to them. 
They hate those who fail to please God and honor those who respect the LORD. If they make a promise to their neighbor, they do what they promised. 
If they loan money to someone, they do not charge them interest. And they refuse to testify against an innocent person, even if someone offers them money to do it. Whoever lives like this will always stand strong.
