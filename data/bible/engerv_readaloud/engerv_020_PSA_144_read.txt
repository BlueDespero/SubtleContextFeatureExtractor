Psalm.
Chapter 144.
A song of David. Praise the LORD! He is my Rock. He prepares me for war. He trains me for battle. 
He loves me and protects me. He is my safe place high on the mountain. He rescues me. He is my shield. I trust in him. He helps me rule my people. 
LORD, why are people important to you? Why do you even notice us? 
Our life is like a puff of air. It is like a passing shadow. 
LORD, tear open the skies and come down. Touch the mountains, and smoke will rise from them. 
Send the lightning and make my enemies run away. Shoot your “arrows” and make them run away. 
Reach down from heaven and save me! Don’t let me drown in this sea of enemies. Save me from these foreigners. 
They are all liars, even when they swear to tell the truth. 
God, I will sing a new song for you. I will play a ten-stringed harp and sing praise to you. 
You are the one who gives victory to kings. You saved your servant David from the sword of his enemy. 
Save me from these foreigners. They are all liars, even when they swear to tell the truth. 
May our sons be as strong as trees and our daughters as beautiful as the carved columns of a palace. 
May our barns be filled with crops of all kinds. May our sheep produce so many lambs, that thousands of sheep will fill our fields. 
And may our cows be heavy with calves. May no enemy break through our walls or carry away any of our people. May there be no cries of pain in our streets. 
How wonderful to have such blessings! Yes, great blessings belong to those who have the LORD as their God.
