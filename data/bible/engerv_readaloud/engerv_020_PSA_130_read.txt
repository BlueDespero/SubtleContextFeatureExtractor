Psalm.
Chapter 130.
A song for going up to the Temple. LORD, I am in deep trouble, so I am calling to you for help. 
My Lord, listen to me. Listen to my cry for help. 
LORD, if you punished people for all their sins, no one would be left alive. 
But you forgive people, so they fear and respect you. 
I am waiting for the LORD to help me. My soul waits for him. I trust what he says. 
I am waiting for my Lord, like a guard waiting and waiting for the morning to come. 
Israel, trust in the LORD. The LORD is the one who is faithful and true. He saves us again and again, 
and he is the one who will save the people of Israel from all their sins.
