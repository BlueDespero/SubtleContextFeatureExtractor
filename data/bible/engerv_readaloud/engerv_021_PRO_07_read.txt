Proverbs.
Chapter 7.
My son, remember my words. Don’t forget what I have told you. 
Consider my teaching as precious as your own eyes. Obey my commands, and you will have a good life. 
Tie them around your finger. Write them on your heart. 
Treat wisdom like the woman you love and knowledge like the one dearest to you. 
Wisdom will save you from that other woman, the other man’s wife, who tempts you with such sweet words. 
One day I was looking out my window 
at some foolish teenagers and noticed one who had no sense at all. 
He was walking through the marketplace and came to the corner where a certain woman lived. He then turned up the road that goes by her house. 
The day was ending. The sun had set, and it was almost dark. 
Suddenly, there she was in front of him, dressed like a prostitute. She had plans for him. 
She was a wild and rebellious woman who would not stay at home. 
She walked the streets, always looking for someone to trap. 
She grabbed the young man and kissed him. Without shame, she looked him in the eye and said, 
“I offered a fellowship offering today. I gave what I promised to give, 
and I still have plenty of food left. So I came out to find you, and here you are! 
I have clean sheets on my bed—special ones from Egypt. 
My bed smells wonderful with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
Come, let’s enjoy ourselves all night. We can make love until dawn. 
My husband has gone on a business trip. 
He took enough money for a long trip and won’t be home for two weeks.” 
This is what the woman said to tempt the young man, and her smooth words tricked him. 
He followed her, like a bull being led to the slaughter. He was like a deer walking into a trap, 
where a hunter waits to shoot an arrow through its heart. The boy was like a bird flying into a net, never seeing the danger he was in. 
Now, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to what I say. 
Don’t let your heart lead you to an evil woman like that. Don’t go where she wants to lead you. 
She has brought down some of the most powerful men; she has left many dead bodies in her path. 
Her house is the place of death. The road to it leads straight to the grave.
