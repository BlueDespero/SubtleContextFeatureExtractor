Isaiah.
Chapter 25.
LORD, you are my God. I honor you and praise your name, because you did amazing things. The words you said long ago are completely true; everything happened exactly as you said it would. 
And you destroyed the city that was protected by strong walls. Now it is only a pile of rocks. The foreign palace has been destroyed. It will never be rebuilt. 
That is why powerful nations will honor you. Powerful people from strong cities will fear you. 
You have been a safe place for poor people in trouble. You are like a shelter from floods and shade from the heat when powerful men attack. They are like rain streaming down the walls that protect us from the storm. 
Like the heat of summer in a dry land, the angry shouts of those foreigners brought us to our knees. But like a thick cloud that blocks the summer heat, you answered their challenge. 
The LORD All-Powerful will give a feast for all the people on this mountain. At the feast, there will be the best foods and wines. The meat will be good and tender, the wine pure and clear. 
But now there is a veil covering all nations and people. This veil is called “death.” 
But death will be destroyed forever. And the Lord GOD will wipe away every tear from every face. In the past, all of his people were sad, but God will take away that sadness from the earth. All of this will happen because the LORD said it would. 
At that time people will say, “Here is our God! He is the one we have been waiting for. He has come to save us. We have been waiting for our LORD. So we will rejoice and be happy when he saves us.” 
The LORD’S power is on this mountain, and Moab will be defeated. The Lord will trample the enemy like someone walking on straw in a pile of waste. 
They will reach out their arms to escape like someone trying to swim. But their pride will sink with each stroke they take. 
He will destroy their high walls and safe places. He will throw them down into the dust on the ground.
