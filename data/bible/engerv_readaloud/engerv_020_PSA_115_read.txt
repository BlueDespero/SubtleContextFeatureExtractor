Psalm.
Chapter 115.
LORD, you should receive the honor, not us. The honor belongs to you because of your faithful love and loyalty. 
Why should the nations wonder where our God is? 
Our God is in heaven, and he does whatever he wants. 
The “gods” of those nations are only statues that some human made from gold and silver. 
Those statues have mouths, but cannot talk. They have eyes, but cannot see. 
They have ears, but cannot hear. They have noses, but cannot smell. 
They have hands, but cannot feel. They have feet, but cannot walk. No sounds come from their throats. 
The people who make and trust in those statues will become like them! 
People of Israel, trust in the LORD! He is your strength and shield. 
Aaron’s family, trust in the LORD! He is your strength and shield. 
Followers of the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is your strength and shield. 
The LORD remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless Israel. He will bless Aaron’s family. 
The LORD will bless his followers, great and small. 
May the LORD give more and more to you and to your children. 
May you receive blessings from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
Heaven belongs to the LORD, but he gave the earth to people. 
The dead don’t praise him. Those in the grave don’t praise the LORD. 
But we will praise the LORD now and forever! Praise the LORD!
