Ezekiel.
Chapter 35.
The word of the LORD came to me. He said, 
“Son of man, look toward Mount Seir and speak against it for me. 
Say to it, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: “‘I am against you, Mount Seir! I will punish you and make you an empty wasteland. 
I will destroy your cities, and you will become empty. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
“‘Why? Because you have always been against my people. You used your sword against Israel at the time of their trouble, at the time of their final punishment.’” 
So the Lord GOD says, “But I promise by my own life that I will let death have you. Death will chase you. You did not hate killing people, so death will chase you. 
I will make Mount Seir an empty ruin. I will kill everyone who enters or leaves that city. 
I will cover its mountains with those who are killed. There will be dead bodies all over your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines. 
I will make you empty forever. No one will live in your cities. Then you will know that I am the LORD.” 
You said, “These two nations and countries, Israel and Judah, will be mine. We will take them for our own.” But the LORD is there! 
And the Lord GOD says, “You were jealous of my people. You were angry and hateful to them. So by my life, I swear that I will punish you the same way you hurt them! I will punish you and let my people know that I am with them. 
And then you, too, will know that I am the LORD. “I have heard you making fun of Israel’s hill country. You said, ‘It is in ruins, just waiting for us to swallow it up.’ 
Your proud boasting is really against me. Time after time you have insulted me, and I have heard every word.” 
This is what the Lord GOD says: “All the earth will be happy when I destroy you. 
You were happy when the country of Israel was destroyed. I will treat you the same way. Mount Seir and the whole country of Edom will be destroyed. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”
