Psalm.
Chapter 32.
A maskil of David. It is a great blessing when people are forgiven for the wrongs they have done, when their sins are erased. 
It is a great blessing when the LORD says they are not guilty, when they don’t try to hide their sins. 
Lord, I prayed to you again and again, but I did not talk about my sins. So I only became weaker and more miserable. 
Every day you made life harder for me. I became like a dry land in the hot summertime. Selah 
But then I decided to confess my sins to the LORD. I stopped hiding my guilt and told you about my sins. And you forgave them all! Selah 
That is why your loyal followers pray to you while there is still time. Then when trouble rises like a flood, it will not reach them. 
You are a hiding place for me. You protect me from my troubles. You surround me and protect me, so I sing about the way you saved me. Selah 
The Lord says, “I will teach you and guide you in the way you should live. I will watch over you and be your guide. 
Don’t be like a stupid horse or mule that will not come to you unless you put a bit in its mouth and pull it with reins.” 
Many pains will come to the wicked, but the LORD’S faithful love will surround those who trust in him. 
Good people, rejoice and be very happy in the LORD. All you who want to do right, rejoice!
