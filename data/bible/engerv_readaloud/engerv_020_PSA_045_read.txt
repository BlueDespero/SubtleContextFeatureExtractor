Psalm.
Chapter 45.
To the director: To the tune “Shoshanim.” A maskil from the Korah family. A love song. Beautiful thoughts fill my mind as I speak these lines for the king. These words come from my tongue as from the pen of a skilled writer. 
You are more handsome than anyone, and you say such pleasant things. So God will always bless you. 
Put on your sword, mighty warrior, so impressive in your splendid uniform. 
Go out in your greatness to win the victory for what is true and right. Let us see the amazing things you can do with your powerful right arm. 
Your sharp arrows will go deep into the hearts of your enemies, who will fall to the ground in front of you. 
God, your kingdom will last forever. You use your authority for justice. 
You love what is right and hate what is wrong. So God, your God, chose you to be king, giving you more joy and honor than anyone like you. 
From your clothes comes the wonderful smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia. In palaces decorated with ivory, you enjoy the music of stringed instruments. 
Here are ladies of honor, daughters of kings. Your bride stands at your right side, wearing a gown decorated with the finest gold. 
My lady, listen to me. Listen carefully and understand me. Forget your people and your father’s family, 
so that the king will be pleased with your beauty. He will be your new husband, so you must honor him. 
People from Tyre will bring you gifts. Their richest people will try to win your friendship. 
The princess is so beautiful in her gown, like a pearl set in gold. 
Clothed in beauty, she is led to the king, followed by her bridesmaids. 
Filled with joy and excitement, they enter into the king’s palace. 
Your sons will be kings like their ancestors. You will make them rulers throughout the land. 
You will be famous for generations. People will praise you forever and ever.
