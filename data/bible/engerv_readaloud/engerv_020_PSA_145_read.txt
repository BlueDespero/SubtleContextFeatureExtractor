Psalm.
Chapter 145.
A song of David. I will tell of your greatness, my God and King. I will praise your name forever and ever. 
I will praise you every day. I will praise your name forever and ever. 
The LORD is great and deserves all our praise! No one can fully understand his greatness! 
Each generation will praise you and tell the next generation about the great things you do. 
Your majesty and glory are wonderful. I will tell about your miracles. 
People will tell about the amazing things you do, and I will tell everyone how great you are. 
They will talk about your goodness and sing about your justice. 
The LORD is kind and merciful, patient and full of love. 
The LORD is good to everyone. He shows his mercy to everything he made. 
LORD, all you have made will give thanks to you. Your loyal followers will praise you. 
They will tell how great your kingdom is. They will tell how great you are. 
So others will learn about the mighty things you do, about the glory of your kingdom—how marvelous it is! 
Your kingdom will never end, and you will rule forever. The LORD can be trusted in all that he says. He is loyal in all that he does. 
The LORD lifts up people who have fallen. He helps those who are in trouble. 
All living things look to you for their food, and you give them their food at the right time. 
You open your hands and give every living thing all that it needs. 
Everything the LORD does is good. Everything he does shows how loyal he is. 
The LORD is near to everyone who sincerely calls to him for help. 
He listens to his followers and does what they want. He answers their prayers and saves them. 
The LORD protects everyone who loves him, but he destroys all who do evil. 
I will praise the LORD! Let everyone praise his holy name forever and ever!
