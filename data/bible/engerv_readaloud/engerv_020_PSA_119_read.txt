Psalm.
Chapter 119.
Great blessings belong to those who live pure lives! They follow the LORD’S teachings. 
Great blessings belong to those who follow his rules! They seek him with all their heart. 
They don’t do wrong. They follow his ways. 
Lord, you gave us your instructions and told us to always obey them. 
How I wish I could be more faithful in obeying your laws! 
Then I would never feel ashamed when I look closely at your commands. 
The more I understand how fair your laws are, the more sincerely I will praise you. 
I will obey your laws, so please don’t leave me! 
How can a young person live a pure life? By obeying your word. 
I try with all my heart to serve you. Help me obey your commands. 
I study your teachings very carefully so that I will not sin against you. 
LORD, you are worthy of praise! Teach me your laws. 
I will repeat the laws we have heard from you. 
I enjoy following your rules as much as others enjoy great riches. 
I will study your instructions. I will give thought to your way of life. 
I enjoy your laws. I will not forget your word. 
Be good to me, your servant, so that I may live to obey your word. 
Open my eyes so that I can see all the wonderful things in your teachings. 
I feel like a stranger visiting here on earth. I need to know your commands. Don’t keep them hidden from me. 
I constantly feel a hunger to understand your laws. 
You tell the proud how angry you are with them. All those who refuse to obey your word are cursed. 
Don’t let me be ashamed and embarrassed. I have obeyed your rules. 
Even if rulers say bad things about me, I am your servant, and I continue to study your laws. 
Your rules make me happy. They give me good advice. 
I lie here like a dying man. Say the word, and I will live again. 
I told you about my life, and you answered me. Now, teach me your laws. 
Help me understand your instructions, and I will think about your wonderful teachings. 
I am sad and tired. Say the word, and make me strong again. 
Don’t let me live a lie. Guide me with your teachings. 
I have chosen to be loyal to you. I respect your laws. 
I follow your rules closely, LORD. Don’t let me be put to shame. 
I do my best to follow your commands, because you are the one who gives me the desire. 
LORD, teach me your laws, and I will always follow them. 
Help me understand your teachings, and I will follow them. Obeying them will be my greatest desire. 
Help me follow your commands, because that makes me happy. 
Give me the desire to follow your rules, not the desire to get rich. 
Don’t let me look at worthless things. Help me live your way. 
Do what you promised me, your servant, so that people will respect you. 
Take away the shame I fear. Your laws are good. 
See how much I want to obey your instructions! Be good to me, and let me live. 
LORD, show me your faithful love. Save me, as you promised. 
Then I will have an answer for those who make fun of me for trusting what you say. 
Let me always say what is true. I depend on your judgment to be fair. 
I will follow your teachings forever and ever. 
So I will live in freedom, because I do my best to know your instructions. 
I will discuss your rules with kings, and no one will embarrass me. 
What joy your commands give me! How I love them! 
Not only do I love your commands, but I also honor them. I will study your laws. 
Remember your promise to me, your servant. It gives me hope. 
You comfort me in my suffering, because your promise gives me new life. 
People full of pride are always making fun of me, but I have not stopped following your teachings. 
I remember the laws you gave us long ago, LORD, and they bring me comfort. 
I am overcome with anger when I see wicked people, who have stopped following your teachings. 
Your laws are the songs I sing wherever I am living. 
LORD, in the night I remembered your name, and I obeyed your teachings. 
This happened because I carefully obey your instructions. 
LORD, I decided that my duty is to obey your commandments. 
I beg you with all my heart, be kind to me, as you promised. 
I thought very carefully about my life, and I decided to follow your rules. 
Without wasting any time, I hurried back to obey your commands. 
The wicked tried to trap me, but I have not forgotten your teachings. 
In the middle of the night, I get up to thank you because your laws are so fair. 
I am a friend to everyone who worships you. I am a friend to everyone who obeys your instructions. 
LORD, your faithful love fills the earth. Teach me your laws. 
LORD, you did good things for me, your servant. You did what you promised to do. 
Give me the knowledge to make wise decisions. I trust your commands. 
Before I suffered, I did many wrong things. But now I carefully obey everything you say. 
You are good, and you do good things. Teach me your laws. 
People full of pride made up lies about me. But I keep obeying your instructions with all my heart. 
Those people are so stupid that they care for nothing, but I enjoy studying your teachings. 
Suffering was good for me; I learned your laws. 
Your teachings are worth more to me than a thousand pieces of silver and gold. 
With your hands you made me and helped me become what I am. Now help me learn and understand your commands. 
Your followers will see me and be happy, because I trust in your word. 
LORD, I know that your decisions are fair, and you were right to punish me. 
Now comfort me with your faithful love, as you promised. 
Comfort me and let me live. I enjoy your teachings. 
Bring shame on those proud people who lied about me. All I want to do is study your instructions. 
Let your followers come back to me so that they may learn your rules. 
Let me obey your laws perfectly so that I will not be ashamed. 
I feel weaker and weaker as I wait for you to save me. But I put my trust in your word. 
I keep looking for what you promised, but my eyes are feeling tired. When will you comfort me? 
Even when I am like a dried wineskin on the trash pile, I will not forget your laws. 
How long must I wait for you to punish those who persecute me? 
Proud people have tried to trap me and make me disobey your teachings. 
All your commands can be trusted. Those people are wrong to persecute me. Help me! 
They have almost destroyed me, but I have not stopped obeying your instructions. 
Show me your faithful love and let me live. I will do whatever you say. 
LORD, your word continues forever in heaven. 
You are loyal forever and ever. You made the earth, and it still stands. 
All things continue today because of your laws. Like slaves, they all obey you. 
If I had not found joy in your teachings, my suffering would have destroyed me. 
I will never forget your commands, because through them you gave me new life. 
I am yours, so save me! I have done my best to know your instructions. 
The wicked tried to destroy me, but your rules made me wise. 
Everything has its limits, except your commands. 
Oh, how I love your teachings! I talk about them all the time. 
Your commands are always with me, and they make me wiser than my enemies. 
I am wiser than all my teachers, because I study your rules. 
I understand more than those who are older, because I obey your instructions. 
I have avoided every path that leads to evil so that I could obey your word. 
You are my teacher, so I will always do whatever you decide. 
Your words are so sweet to me, like the taste of honey! 
I gain understanding from your instructions, so I hate anything that leads people the wrong way. 
Your word is like a lamp that guides my steps, a light that shows the path I should take. 
Your laws are good and fair. I have promised to obey them, and I will keep my promise. 
LORD, I have suffered for a long time. Say the word, and I will live again! 
LORD, accept the praise I want to give you, and teach me your laws. 
My life is always in danger, but I have not forgotten your teachings. 
The wicked try to trap me, but I have not disobeyed your instructions. 
The rules you have given me to follow will be mine forever. They give me great joy. 
More than anything I want to obey your laws always, until the end of my life. 
Lord, I hate those who are not completely loyal to you, but I love your teachings. 
Hide me and protect me. I trust what you say. 
Don’t come near me, you who are evil, so that I can obey my God’s commands. 
Support me, Lord, as you promised, and I will live. I trust in you, so don’t disappoint me. 
Help me and I will be saved. And I will always give attention to your laws. 
You reject all who don’t obey your laws, because they are liars and did not do what they said. 
You throw away the wicked of this world like trash. So I love your rules. 
I am shaking with fear before you. I fear and respect your judgments. 
I have done what is right and good. Don’t let me fall into the hands of those who want to hurt me. 
Promise to be good to me, your servant. Don’t let those proud people do harm to me. 
I have worn out my eyes looking for your help, waiting for you to save me, as you promised. 
Show your faithful love to me, your servant. Teach me your laws. 
I am your servant. Give me wisdom to understand your rules. 
LORD, it is time for you to do something. The people do what is against your teachings. 
I love your commands more than gold, more than the purest gold. 
I carefully obey all your commands. So I hate anything that leads people the wrong way. 
Lord, your rules are wonderful. That is why I follow them. 
As people understand your word, it brings light to their lives. Your word makes even simple people wise. 
My desire to hear your commands is so strong that I wait with open mouth, gasping for breath. 
Look at me, and be kind to me, just as you always are to those who love your name. 
Guide me, as you promised. Don’t let evil rule over me. 
Save me from those who want to hurt me, and I will obey your instructions. 
Accept your servant, and teach me your laws. 
I have cried a river of tears because people don’t obey your teachings. 
LORD, you do what is right, and your decisions are fair. 
The rules you have given us are right. We can trust them completely. 
Something that really upsets me is the thought that my enemies ignore your commands. 
I love your word. Time and again it has been proven true. 
I am young, and people don’t respect me. But I have not forgotten your instructions. 
Your goodness is forever, and your teachings can be trusted. 
Even though I have troubles and hard times, your commands give me joy. 
Your rules are always right. Help me understand them so that I can live. 
LORD, I call to you with all my heart. Answer me, and I will obey your laws. 
I call to you. Save me, and I will obey your rules. 
I get up early in the morning to pray to you. I trust what you say. 
Late into the night I stay awake to think about your word. 
I know your love is true, so listen to me. LORD, you always do what is right, so let me live. 
Here come those who have evil plans to hurt me. They live far away from your teachings. 
But you are near me, LORD, and all your commands can be trusted. 
Long ago, I learned from your rules that you made them to last forever. 
Look at my suffering and rescue me. I have not forgotten your teachings. 
Argue my case, and set me free. Let me live, as you promised. 
The wicked have no hope of being saved, because they don’t follow your laws. 
LORD, you are very kind. You always do what is right, so let me live. 
I have many enemies trying to hurt me, but I have not stopped following your rules. 
I look at those traitors and hate what I see, because they refuse to do what you say. 
See how much I love your instructions! LORD, I know your love is true, so let me live. 
Every word you say can be trusted. Your laws are fair and will last forever. 
Powerful leaders attack me for no reason, but the only thing I fear is your command. 
Your word makes me happy, like someone who has found a great treasure. 
I hate lies; they make me sick! But I love your teachings. 
Seven times a day I praise you because your laws are fair. 
Those who love your teachings will find true peace. Nothing can make them fall. 
LORD, I am waiting for you to save me. I obey your commands. 
I follow your rules. I love them very much. 
I obey all your instructions and rules, because you know everything I do. 
LORD, listen to my cry for help. Make me wise, as you promised. 
Listen to my prayer. Save me, as you promised. 
I will burst into songs of praise, because you have taught me your laws. 
Let my voice sing about your word, because all your commands are good. 
I have chosen to follow your instructions, so reach out and help me! 
LORD, I want you to save me. Your teachings make me happy. 
Let me live to praise you. Let me find the help I need in your laws. 
I have wandered away like a lost sheep. Come and find me. I am your servant, and I have not forgotten your commands.
