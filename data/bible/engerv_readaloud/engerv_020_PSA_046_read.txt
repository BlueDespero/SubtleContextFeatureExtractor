Psalm.
Chapter 46.
To the director: A song from the Korah family. Use the alamoth. A song. God is our protection and source of strength. He is always ready to help us in times of trouble. 
So we are not afraid when the earth quakes and the mountains fall into the sea. 
We are not afraid when the seas become rough and dark and the mountains tremble. Selah 
There is a river whose streams bring happiness to God’s city, to the holy city of God Most High. 
God is in that city, so it will never be destroyed. He is there to help even before sunrise. 
Nations will shake with fear and kingdoms will fall when God shouts and makes the earth move. 
The LORD All-Powerful is with us. The God of Jacob is our place of safety. Selah 
Look at the powerful things the LORD has done. See the awesome things he has done on earth. 
He stops wars all over the world. He breaks the soldiers’ bows, shatters their spears, and burns their shields. 
God says, “Stop fighting and know that I am God! I am the one who defeats the nations; I am the one who controls the world.” 
The LORD All-Powerful is with us. The God of Jacob is our place of safety. Selah
