Psalm.
Chapter 16.
A miktam of David. Protect me, God, because I depend on you. 
Some of you have said to the LORD, “You are my Lord. Every good thing I have comes from you.” 
But you have also said about the gods of this land, “They are my powerful gods. They are the ones who make me happy.” 
But those who worship other gods will have many troubles. I will not share in the gifts of blood they offer to their idols. I will not even say their names. 
LORD, you give me all that I need. You support me. You give me my share. 
My share is wonderful. My inheritance is very beautiful. 
I praise the LORD because he taught me well. Even at night he put his instructions deep inside my mind. 
I always remember that the LORD is with me. He is here, close by my side, so nothing can defeat me. 
So my heart and soul will be very happy. Even my body will live in safety, 
because you will not leave me in the place of death. You will not let your faithful one rot in the grave. 
You will teach me the right way to live. Just being with you will bring complete happiness. Being at your right side will make me happy forever.
