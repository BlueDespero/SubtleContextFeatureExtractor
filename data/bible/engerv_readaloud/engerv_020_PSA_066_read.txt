Psalm.
Chapter 66.
To the director: A song of praise. Everything on earth, shout with joy to God! 
Praise his glorious name! Honor him with songs of praise! 
Tell God, “Your works are wonderful! Your great power makes your enemies bow down in fear before you. 
Let the whole world worship you. Let everyone sing praises to your name.” Selah 
Look at what God has done! These things amaze us. 
He changed the sea to dry land, and his people went across the water on foot. So let’s celebrate because of what he has done! 
He rules the world with his great power. He watches people everywhere. No one can rebel against him. Selah 
People, praise our God. Sing loud songs of praise to him. 
He continues to give us life, and he keeps us from falling. 
God, you have tested us, as people test silver with fire. 
You let us be trapped. You put heavy burdens on us. 
You let our enemies run over us. We went through fire and water, but you brought us to a safe place. 
So I bring sacrifices to your Temple. When I was in trouble, I asked for help and made promises to you. Now I am giving you what I promised. 
I bring my best sheep as burnt offerings. I offer the smoke from them up to you. I give you sacrifices of bulls and goats. Selah 
All you people who worship God, come and I will tell you what he has done for me. 
I cried out to him for help, and I praised him. If I had been hiding sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened to me. 
But God did listen to me; he heard my prayer. 
Praise God! He did not turn away from me—he listened to my prayer. He continues to show his love to me!
