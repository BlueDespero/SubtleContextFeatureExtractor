Psalm.
Chapter 52.
To the director: A maskil of David written when Doeg the Edomite went to Saul and told him, “David is in Ahimelech’s house.” Great warrior, why are you bragging about the evil you did? You are a disgrace to God. 
You are nothing but a hired killer, making plans to hurt people and making up lies! 
You love evil more than goodness. You love lies more than truth. Selah 
You and your lying tongue love to hurt people. 
So God will ruin you forever! He will grab you and pull you from your home, like someone pulling up a plant by the roots! Selah 
Good people will see this and learn to fear and respect God. They will laugh at you and say, 
“Look what happened to the warrior who did not depend on God. That fool thought his wealth and lies would protect him.” 
But I am like a green olive tree growing in God’s Temple. I will trust God’s faithful love forever and ever. 
God, I praise you forever for what you have done. I will speak your name before your followers because it is so good!
