Psalm.
Chapter 65.
To the director: A praise song of David. God in Zion, we praise you and give you what we promised. 
Anyone can come to you, and you will listen to their prayers. 
When our sins become too heavy for us, you wipe them away. 
Oh, how wonderful it is to be the people you chose to come and stay in your Temple. And we are so happy to have the wonderful things that are in your Temple, your holy palace. 
God, you answer our prayers and do what is right. You do amazing things to save us. People all over the world know they can trust in you, even those who live across the sea. 
You made the mountains. We see your power all around us. 
You can calm the roughest seas or the nations raging around us. 
People all around the world are amazed at the wonderful things you do. You make all people, east and west, sing with joy. 
You take care of the land. You water it and make it fertile. Your streams are always filled with water. That’s how you make the crops grow. 
You pour rain on the plowed fields; you soak the fields with water. You make the ground soft with rain, and you make the young plants grow. 
You start the new year with a good harvest. You end the year with many crops. 
The desert and hills are covered with grass. 
The pastures are covered with sheep. The valleys are filled with grain. Everything is singing and shouting for joy.
