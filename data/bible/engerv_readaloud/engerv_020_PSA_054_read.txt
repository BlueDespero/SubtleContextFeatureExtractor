Psalm.
Chapter 54.
To the director: With instruments. A maskil of David written when the Ziphites went to Saul and told him, “We think David is hiding among our people.” God, use your power and save me. Use your great power to set me free. 
God, listen to my prayer. Listen to what I say. 
Strangers who don’t even think about God have turned against me. Those powerful men are trying to kill me. Selah 
Look, my God will help me. My Lord will support me. 
He will punish the people who turned against me. God, be faithful to me and destroy them. 
LORD, I will give freewill offerings to you. I will praise your good name. 
You saved me from all my troubles. I saw my enemies defeated.
