Psalm.
Chapter 30.
A song of David for the dedication of the Temple. LORD, you lifted me out of my troubles. You did not give my enemies a reason to laugh, so I will praise you. 
LORD my God, I prayed to you, and you healed me. 
LORD, you lifted me out of the grave. I was falling into the place of death, but you saved my life. 
Praise the LORD, you who are loyal to him! Praise his holy name! 
His anger lasts for a little while, but then his kindness brings life. The night may be filled with tears, but in the morning we can sing for joy! 
When I was safe and secure, I thought nothing could hurt me. 
Yes, LORD, while you were kind to me, I felt that nothing could defeat me. But when you turned away from me, I was filled with fear. 
So, LORD, I turned and prayed to you. I asked you, Lord, to show me mercy. 
I said, “What good is it if I die and go down to the grave? The dead just lie in the dirt. They cannot praise you. They cannot tell anyone how faithful you are. 
LORD, hear my prayer, and be kind to me. LORD, help me!” 
You have changed my sorrow into dancing. You have taken away my sackcloth and clothed me with joy. 
You wanted me to praise you and not be silent. LORD my God, I will praise you forever!
