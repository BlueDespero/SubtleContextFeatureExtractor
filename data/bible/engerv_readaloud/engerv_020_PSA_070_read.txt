Psalm.
Chapter 70.
To the director: A song of David to help people remember. Please, God, rescue me! LORD, hurry and help me! 
People are trying to kill me. Please disappoint them. Humiliate them! They want to hurt me. Make them run away in shame. 
May those who make fun of me be too embarrassed to speak. 
But may those who come to you be happy and rejoice. May those who love being saved by you always be able to say, “Praise God!” 
I am only a poor, helpless man. God, please hurry to me. You are my helper, the one who can save me. LORD, don’t be too late!
