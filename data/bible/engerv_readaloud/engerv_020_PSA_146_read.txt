Psalm.
Chapter 146.
Praise the LORD! My soul, praise the LORD! 
I will praise the LORD all my life. I will sing praises to him as long as I live. 
Don’t depend on your leaders for help. Don’t depend on people, because they cannot save you. 
People die and are buried. Then all their plans to help are gone. 
It is a great blessing for people to have the God of Jacob to help them. They depend on the LORD their God. 
He made heaven and earth. He made the sea and everything in it. He can be trusted to do what he says. 
He does what is right for those who have been hurt. He gives food to the hungry. The LORD frees people locked up in prison. 
The LORD makes the blind see again. The LORD helps those who are in trouble. The LORD loves those who do right. 
The LORD protects strangers in our country. He cares for widows and orphans, but he destroys the wicked. 
The LORD will rule forever! Zion, your God will rule forever and ever! Praise the LORD!
