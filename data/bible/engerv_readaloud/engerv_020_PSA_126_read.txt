Psalm.
Chapter 126.
A song for going up to the Temple. It will be like a dream when the LORD comes back with the captives of Zion. 
We will laugh and sing happy songs! Then the other nations will say, “The LORD did a great thing for Zion!” 
Yes, we will be happy because the LORD did a great thing for us. 
So, LORD, bring back the good times, like a desert stream filled again with flowing water. 
Then those who were sad when they planted will be happy when they gather the harvest! 
Those who cried as they carried the seeds will be happy when they bring in the crops!
