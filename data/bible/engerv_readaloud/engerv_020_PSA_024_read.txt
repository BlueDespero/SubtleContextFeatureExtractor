Psalm.
Chapter 24.
A song of David. The earth and everything on it belong to the LORD. The world and all its people belong to him. 
He built the earth on the water. He built it over the rivers. 
Who can go up on the LORD’S mountain? Who can stand in his holy Temple? 
Only those who have not done evil, who have pure hearts, who have not used my name to hide their lies, and who have not made false promises. 
Good people ask the LORD to bless others. They ask God, their Savior, to do good things. 
They try to follow God. They go to the God of Jacob for help. Selah 
Gates, proudly lift your heads! Open, ancient doors, and the glorious King will come in. 
Who is the glorious King? He is the LORD, the powerful soldier. He is the LORD, the war hero. 
Gates, proudly lift your heads! Open, ancient doors, and the glorious King will come in. 
Who is the glorious King? The LORD All-Powerful is the glorious King.
