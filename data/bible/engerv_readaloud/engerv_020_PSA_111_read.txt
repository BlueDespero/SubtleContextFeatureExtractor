Psalm.
Chapter 111.
Praise the LORD! I thank the LORD with all my heart in the assembly of his good people. 
The LORD does wonderful things, more than anyone could ask for. 
The things he does are great and glorious! There is no end to his goodness. 
He does amazing things so that we will remember that the LORD is kind and merciful. 
He gives food to his followers. He remembers his agreement forever. 
He has shown his people how powerful he is by giving them the land of other nations. 
Everything he does is good and fair. All his commands can be trusted. 
His commands will continue forever. They must be done with truth and honesty. 
He rescued his people and made his agreement with them forever. His name is awesome and holy. 
Wisdom begins with fear and respect for the LORD. Those who obey him are very wise. Praises will be sung to him forever.
