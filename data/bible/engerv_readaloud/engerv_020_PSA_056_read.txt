Psalm.
Chapter 56.
To the director: To the tune “The Dove in the Distant Oak.” A miktam of David written when the Philistines captured him in Gath. God, people have attacked me, so be merciful to me. They have been chasing me all day, closing in to attack me. 
My enemies come at me constantly. There are too many fighters to count. 
When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. 
I trust God, so I am not afraid of what people can do to me! I praise God for his promise to me. 
My enemies are always twisting my words. They are always making plans against me. 
They hide together and watch every move I make, hoping for some way to kill me. 
God, send them away because of the bad things they did. Show your anger and defeat those people. 
You know I am very upset. You know how much I have cried. Surely you have kept an account of all my tears. 
I know that when l call for help, my enemies will turn and run. I know that because God is with me! 
I praise God for his promise. I praise the LORD for his promise to me. 
I trust God, so I am not afraid of what people can do to me! 
God, I will keep the special promises I made to you. I will give you my thank offering. 
You saved me from death. You kept me from being defeated. So I will serve you in the light that only the living can see.
