Song of Songs.
Chapter 3.
At night on my bed, I look for the man I love. I looked for him, but I could not find him. 
I will get up now! I will go around the city. In the streets and squares, I will look for the man I love. I looked for him, but I could not find him. 
The guards patrolling the city found me. I asked them, “Have you seen the man I love?” 
I had just left the guards when I found the man I love! I held him and would not let him go, while I took him to my mother’s house, to the room of one who bore me. 
Women of Jerusalem, promise me by the gazelles and wild deer, don’t awaken love, don’t arouse love, until I am ready. 
Who is this woman coming from the desert with this large group of people? The dust rises behind them like clouds of smoke from burning myrrh and frankincense and other spices. 
Look, Solomon’s traveling chair. There are 60 soldiers guarding it, strong soldiers of Israel. 
All of them are trained fighting men with their swords at their side, ready for any danger of the night. 
King Solomon made a traveling chair for himself. The wood came from Lebanon. 
The poles were made from silver, and the supports were made from gold. The seat was covered with purple cloth. It was inlaid with love by the women of Jerusalem. 
Women of Zion, come out and see King Solomon. See the crown his mother put on him the day he was married, the day he was so happy!
