Psalm.
Chapter 95.
Come, let us sing praise to the LORD! Let us shout praises to the Rock who saves us. 
Come and worship him with songs of thanks. Let us sing happy songs of praise to him. 
For the LORD is a great God, the great King ruling over all the other “gods.” 
The deepest caves and the highest mountains belong to him. 
The ocean is his—he created it. He made the dry land with his own hands. 
Come, let us bow down and worship him! Let us kneel before the LORD who made us. 
He is our God, and we are the people he cares for, his sheep that walk by his side. Listen to his voice today: 
“Don’t be stubborn, as you were at Meribah, as you were at Massah in the desert. 
Your ancestors doubted and tested me, even after they saw what I could do! 
I was angry with them for 40 years. I said, ‘They are not faithful to me. They refuse to do what I say.’ 
So in my anger I made this vow: ‘They will never enter my land of rest.’”
