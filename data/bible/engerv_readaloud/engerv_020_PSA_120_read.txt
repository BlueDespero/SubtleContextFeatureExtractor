Psalm.
Chapter 120.
A song for going up to the Temple. I was in trouble. I called to the LORD for help, and he answered me! 
I said, “LORD, save me from liars, from those who say things that are not true.” 
Liars, do you know what the Lord has for you? Do you know what you will get? 
You will get a soldier’s sharp arrow and hot coals to punish you. 
How I hate living here among these people! It’s like living in Meshech or in the tents of Kedar. 
I have lived too long with those who hate peace. 
I ask for peace, but they want war.
