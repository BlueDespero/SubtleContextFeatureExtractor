Psalm.
Chapter 26.
A song of David. LORD, you be the judge and prove that I have lived a pure life. I have depended on you, LORD, to keep me from falling. 
Look closely at me, LORD, and test me. Judge my deepest thoughts and emotions. 
I always remember your faithful love. I depend on your faithfulness. 
I don’t run around with troublemakers. I have nothing to do with hypocrites. 
I hate being around evil people. I refuse to join those gangs of crooks. 
LORD, I wash my hands to make myself pure, so that I can come to your altar. 
I sing a song to give you thanks, and I tell about all the wonderful things you have done. 
LORD, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory is. 
Lord, don’t treat me like one of those sinners. Don’t kill me with those murderers. 
They are guilty of cheating people. They take bribes to do wrong. 
But I am innocent, so be kind to me and save me. 
I am safe from all danger as I stand here praising you, LORD, in the assembly of your people.
