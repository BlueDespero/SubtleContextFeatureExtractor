Psalm.
Chapter 8.
To the director: With the gittith. A song of David. LORD our Lord, your name is the most wonderful in all the earth! It brings you praise everywhere in heaven. 
From the mouths of children and babies come songs of praise to you. They sing of your power to silence your enemies who were seeking revenge. 
I look at the heavens you made with your hands. I see the moon and the stars you created. 
And I wonder, “Why are people so important to you? Why do you even think about them? Why do you care so much about humans? Why do you even notice them?” 
But you made them almost like gods and crowned them with glory and honor. 
You put them in charge of everything you made. You put everything under their control. 
People rule over the sheep and cattle and all the wild animals. 
They rule over the birds in the sky and the fish that swim in the sea. 
LORD our Lord, your name is the most wonderful name in all the earth!
