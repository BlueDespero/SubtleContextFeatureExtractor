Psalm.
Chapter 48.
A song of praise from the Korah family. The LORD is great! He is praised throughout the city of our God, his holy mountain. 
His city is such a pleasant place. It brings joy to people from around the world. Mount Zion is the true mountain of God. It is the city of the great King. 
In the palaces of that city, God is known as the fortress. 
Once some kings met together and planned an attack against this city. They marched toward the city, 
but when they saw it, they were amazed. They all panicked and ran away. 
Fear grabbed them; they trembled like a woman giving birth. 
God, with a strong east wind, you wrecked their big ships. 
Yes, we heard the stories about your power. But we also saw it in the city of our God, the city of the LORD All-Powerful. God makes that city strong forever. Selah 
God, in your Temple we remember your loving kindness. 
Your name is known everywhere, God, and people throughout the earth praise you. You have shown that you do what is right. 
Mount Zion is happy, and the towns of Judah rejoice, because your decisions are fair. 
Walk around Jerusalem, and count its towers. 
Look at the tall walls, and see the palaces. Then you can tell the next generation about them. 
This God is our God forever and ever. He will lead us from now to the end of time!
