Revelation.
Chapter 4.
After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, a voice as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter. 
And straightaway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven (and one sitting upon the throne) 
like a jasper stone and a sardius to look upon: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, like emeralds to look upon. 
And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones the four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold. 
And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are seven Spirits of God; 
and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. 
And the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. 
And the four living creatures, having each one six wings, are also full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come. 
And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth forever and ever, 
the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth forever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.
