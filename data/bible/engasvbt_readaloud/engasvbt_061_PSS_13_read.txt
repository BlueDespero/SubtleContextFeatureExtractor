Psalms of Solomon.
Chapter 13.
Of Solomon. A Psalm. Comfort for the righteous. The right hand of the Lord hath covered me; The right hand of the Lord hath spared us. 
The arm of the Lord hath saved us from the sword that passed through, From famine and the death of sinners. 
Noisome beasts ran upon them: With their teeth they tare their flesh, And with their molars crushed their bones; 
But from all these things the Lord delivered us. 
The righteous was troubled on account of his errors, Lest he should be taken away along with the sinners; 
For terrible is the overthrow of the sinner; But not one of all these things toucheth the righteous. 
For not alike are the chastening of the righteous for sins done in ignorance, And the overthrow of the sinners. 
Secretly is the righteous chastened, Lest the sinner rejoice over the righteous. 
For he correcteth the righteous as a beloved son, And his chastisement is as that of a firstborn. 
For the Lord spareth his pious ones, And blotteth out their errors by his chastening. 
For the life of the righteous shall be forever; But sinners shall be taken away into destruction, And their memorial shall be found no more. 
But upon the pious is the mercy of the Lord, And upon them that fear him his mercy.
