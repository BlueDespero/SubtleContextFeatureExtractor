Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A song of ascents. Out of the depths I cry to you, Yahweh. 
Lord, hear my voice; let your ears be attentive to my pleas for mercy. 
If you, Yahweh, would mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? 
But there is forgiveness with you, that you may be revered. 
I wait for Yahweh, my soul waits, and in his word I hope. 
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning. 
Israel, hope in Yahweh. Yahweh is merciful, and he is very willing to forgive. 
It is he who will redeem Israel from all his sins.
