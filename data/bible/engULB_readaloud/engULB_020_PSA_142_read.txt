Psalms.
Chapter 142.
A maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a prayer. With my voice I cry out for help to Yahweh; with my voice I plead for Yahweh's favor. 
I pour out my lament before him; I tell him my troubles. 
When my spirit is weak within me, you know my path. In the way that I walk they have hidden a trap for me. 
I look to my right and and see that there is no one who cares about me. There is no escape for me; no one cares about my life. 
I called out to you, Yahweh; I said, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living. 
Listen to my call, for I have been brought very low; rescue me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I. 
Bring my soul out of prison so that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will gather around me because you have been good to me.”
