Psalms.
Chapter 99.
Yahweh reigns; let the nations tremble. He sits enthroned above the cherubim; the earth quakes. 
Yahweh is great in Zion; he is exalted above all the nations. 
Let them praise your great and awesome name; he is holy. 
The king is strong, and he loves justice. You have established fairness; you have done righteousness and justice in Jacob. 
Praise Yahweh our God and worship at his footstool. He is holy. 
Moses and Aaron were among his priests, and Samuel was among those who called on his name. They called to Yahweh, and he answered them. 
He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud. They kept his solemn commands and the statutes that he gave them. 
You answered them, Yahweh our God. A forgiving God you were to them, but one who punished their sinful deeds. 
Praise Yahweh our God, and worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh our God is holy.
