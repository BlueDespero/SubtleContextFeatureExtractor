Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Praise Yahweh. Praise Yahweh, my soul. 
I give praise to Yahweh with all my life; I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 
Do not put your trust in princes or in mankind, in whom there is no salvation. 
When a person's life's breath stops, he returns to the ground; on that day his plans end. 
Blessed is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Yahweh his God. 
Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; he observes trustworthiness forever. 
He executes justice for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners; 
Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind; Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down; Yahweh loves the righteous people. 
Yahweh protects the foreigners in the land; he lifts up the fatherless and widow, but he opposes the wicked. 
Yahweh will reign forever, your God, Zion, for all generations. Praise Yahweh.
