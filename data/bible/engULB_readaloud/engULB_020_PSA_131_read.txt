Psalms.
Chapter 131.
A song of ascents; of David. Yahweh, my heart is not proud or my eyes haughty. I do not have great hopes for myself or concern myself with things that are beyond me. 
Indeed I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, my soul within me is like a weaned child. 
Israel, hope in Yahweh now and forever.
