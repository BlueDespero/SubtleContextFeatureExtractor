Psalms.
Chapter 34.
A psalm of David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him out. I will praise Yahweh at all times, his praise will always be in my mouth. 
I will praise Yahweh! May the oppressed hear and rejoice. 
Praise Yahweh with me, let us lift up his name together. 
I sought Yahweh and he answered me, and he gave me victory over all my fears. 
Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces are not ashamed. 
This oppressed man cried and Yahweh heard him and saved him from all his troubles. 
The angel of Yahweh camps around those who fear him and rescues them. 
Taste and see that Yahweh is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. 
Fear Yahweh, you his holy people. There is no lack for those who fear him. 
The young lions sometimes lack food and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh will not lack anything good. 
Come, sons, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of Yahweh. 
What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? 
Then keep your tongue from evil and keep your lips from speaking lies. 
Turn away from evil and do good. Seek peace and go after it. 
The eyes of Yahweh are on the righteous and his ears are directed toward their cry. 
The face of Yahweh is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. 
The righteous cry out and Yahweh hears and he rescues them from all their troubles. 
Yahweh is close to the brokenhearted, and he saves those who are crushed in spirit. 
Many are the troubles of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers them out of them all. 
He keeps all his bones, not one of them will be broken. 
Evil will kill the wicked. Those who hate the righteous will be condemned. 
Yahweh rescues the lives of his servants. None of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
