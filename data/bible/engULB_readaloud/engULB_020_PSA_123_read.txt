Psalms.
Chapter 123.
A song of ascents. To you I lift up my eyes, you who are enthroned in the heavens. 
See, as the eyes of servants look to their master's hand, as the eyes of a maid look to her mistress's hand, so our eyes look to Yahweh our God until he has mercy on us. 
Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we are filled with humiliation. 
We are more than full of the scoffing of the insolent and with the contempt of the proud.
