Psalms.
Chapter 14.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David. A fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity; there is no one who does good. 
Yahweh looks down from heaven on the children of mankind to see if there are any who understand, who seek after him. 
They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, no, not one. 
Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity, those who eat up my people as they eat bread, but who do not call on Yahweh? 
They tremble with dread, for God is with the righteous assembly! 
You want to humiliate the poor person even though Yahweh is his refuge. 
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When Yahweh brings back his people from the captivity, then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!
