Psalms.
Chapter 100.
A psalm of thanksgiving. Shout joyfully to Yahweh, all the earth. 
Serve Yahweh with gladness; come before his presence with joyful singing. 
Know that Yahweh is God; he made us, and we are his. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and bless his name. 
For Yahweh is good; his covenant faithfulness endures forever and his truthfulness through all generations.
