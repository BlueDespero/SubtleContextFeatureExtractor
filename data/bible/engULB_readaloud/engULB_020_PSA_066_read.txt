Psalms.
Chapter 66.
For the chief musician. A song, a psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth; 
Sing out the glory of his name; make his praise glorious. 
Say to God, “How terrifying are your deeds! By the greatness of your power your enemies will submit to you. 
All the earth will worship you and will sing to you; they will sing to your name.” Selah 
Come and see the works of God; he is fearsome in his deeds toward the sons of mankind. 
He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there we rejoiced in him. 
He rules forever by his might; his eyes observe the nations; let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 
Give blessing to God, you people, let the sound of his praise be heard. 
He keeps us among the living, and he does not permit our feet to slip. 
For you, God, have tested us; you have tested us as silver is tested. 
You brought us into a net; you laid a heavy burden on our backs. 
You made people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us out into a spacious place. 
I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will pay you my vows 
which my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in distress. 
I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals with the sweet aroma of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah 
Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul. 
I cried to him with my mouth, and he was praised with my tongue. 
If I had seen sin within my heart, the Lord would not have listened to me. 
But God has truly heard; he has paid attention to the voice of my prayer. 
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer or his covenant faithfulness from me.
