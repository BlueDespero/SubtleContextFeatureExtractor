Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise Yahweh. Sing to Yahweh a new song; sing his praise in the assembly of the faithful ones. 
Let Israel rejoice in the one who made them; let the people of Zion rejoice in their king. 
Let them praise his name with dancing; let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp. 
For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people; he glorifies the humble with salvation. 
Let the godly rejoice in victory; let them sing for joy on their beds. 
May the praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hand 
to execute vengeance on the nations and acts of punishment on the peoples. 
They will bind their kings with chains and their nobles with iron shackles. 
They will execute the judgment that is written. This will be an honor for all his faithful ones. Praise Yahweh.
