Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Praise Yahweh. Praise God in his holy place; praise him in the mighty heavens. 
Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him for his surpassing greatness. 
Praise him with the blast of the horn; praise him with lute and harp. 
Praise him with tambourines and dancing; praise him with stringed instruments and wind instruments. 
Praise him with loud cymbals; praise him with high sounding cymbals. 
Let everything that has breath praise Yahweh. Praise Yahweh.
