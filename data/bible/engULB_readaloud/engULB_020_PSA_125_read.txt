Psalms.
Chapter 125.
A song of ascents. Those who trust in Yahweh are like Mount Zion, unshakable, forever enduring. 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his people now and forever. 
The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of the righteous. Otherwise the righteous might do what is wrong. 
Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good and to those who are upright in their hearts. 
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers. May peace be on Israel.
