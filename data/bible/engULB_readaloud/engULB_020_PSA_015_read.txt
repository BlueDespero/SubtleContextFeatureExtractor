Psalms.
Chapter 15.
A psalm of David. Yahweh, who may stay in your tabernacle? Who may live on your holy hill? 
Whoever walks blamelessly, does what is right and speaks truth from his heart. 
He does not slander with his tongue, he does not harm others, and he does not insult his neighbor. 
The worthless person is despised in his eyes, but he honors those who fear Yahweh. He swears to his own disadvantage and does not take back his promises. 
He does not charge interest when he lends money. He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
