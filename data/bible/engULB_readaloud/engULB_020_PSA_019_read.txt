Psalms.
Chapter 19.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the skies make his handiwork known! 
Day after day speech pours out; night after night it reveals knowledge. 
There is no speech or spoken words; their voice is not heard. 
Yet their words go out over all the earth, and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched a tent for the sun among them. 
The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race. 
The sun rises from the one horizon and crosses the sky to the other; nothing escapes its heat. 
The law of Yahweh is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Yahweh is reliable, making the simple wise. 
The instructions of Yahweh are right, making the heart glad; the commandment of Yahweh is pure, bringing light to the eyes. 
The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever; the righteous decrees of Yahweh are true and altogether right! 
They are of greater value than gold, even more than much fine gold; they are sweeter than honey and the dripping honey from the honeycomb. 
Yes, by them your servant is warned; in obeying them there is great reward. 
Who can discern all his own errors? Cleanse me from hidden faults. 
Keep your servant also from arrogant sins; let them not rule over me. Then I will be perfect, and I will be innocent from many transgressions. 
May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.
