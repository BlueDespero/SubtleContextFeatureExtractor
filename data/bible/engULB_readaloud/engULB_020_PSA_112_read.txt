Psalms.
Chapter 112.
Praise Yahweh. Blessed is the man who obeys Yahweh, who greatly delights in his commandments. 
His descendants will be powerful on earth; the descendants of the godly man will be blessed. 
Wealth and riches are in his house; his righteousness will endure forever. 
Light shines in the darkness for the godly person; he is gracious, merciful, and just. 
It goes well for the man who deals graciously and lends money, who conducts his affairs with honesty. 
For he will never be moved; the righteous person will be remembered forever. 
He does not fear bad news; he is confident, trusting in Yahweh. 
His heart is tranquil, without fear, until he looks in triumph over his adversaries. 
He generously gives to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; he will be exalted with honor. 
The wicked person will see this and be angry; he will grind his teeth in rage and he will melt away; the desire of the wicked people will perish.
