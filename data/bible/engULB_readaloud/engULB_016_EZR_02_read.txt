There were 392 total descendants of those assigned to serve in the temple and descendants of Solomon's servants. 
Those who left Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer—but were not able to prove their ancestry from Israel 
—included 652 descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda. 
Also, from the priest's descendants: the descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who took his wife from the daughters of Barzillai of Gilead and was called by their name). 
They searched for their genealogical records, but could not find them, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
So the governor told them they must not eat any of the holy sacrifices until a priest with Urim and Thummim approved. 
The whole group totaled 42,360, 
not including their servants and their maidservants (these were 7,337) and their male and female temple singers (two hundred). 
Their horses: 736. Their mules: 245. 
Their camels: 435. Their donkeys: 6,720. 
When they went to Yahweh's house in Jerusalem, the chief patriarchs offered freewill gifts to build the house. 
They gave according to their ability to the work fund: sixty-one thousand gold darics, five thousand silver minas, and one hundred priestly tunics. 
So the priests and Levites, the people, the temple singers and gatekeepers, and those assigned to serve in the temple inhabited their cities. All the people in Israel were in their cities.
