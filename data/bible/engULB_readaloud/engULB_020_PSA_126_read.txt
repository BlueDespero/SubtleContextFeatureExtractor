Psalms.
Chapter 126.
A song of ascents. When Yahweh restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 
Then our mouths were filled with laughter and our tongues with singing. Then they said among the nations, “Yahweh has done great things for them.” 
Yahweh did great things for us; how glad we were! 
Restore our fortunes, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev. 
Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy. 
He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will return again with shouts of joy, bringing his bundles of grain with him.
