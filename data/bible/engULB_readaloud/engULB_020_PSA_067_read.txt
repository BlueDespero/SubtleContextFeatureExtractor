Psalms.
Chapter 67.
For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A psalm, a song. May God be merciful to us and bless us and cause his face to shine on us Selah 
so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations. 
Let the peoples praise you, God; let all the peoples praise you. 
Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with justice and govern the nations on earth. Selah 
Let the peoples praise you, God; let all the peoples praise you. 
The earth has yielded its harvest and God, our God, has blessed us. 
God has blessed us, and all the ends of the earth honor him.
