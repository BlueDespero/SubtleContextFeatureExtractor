Jonah.
Chapter 2.
Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the fish's stomach. 
He said, “I called out to Yahweh about my distress and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help! You heard my voice. 
You had thrown me into the depths, into the heart of the seas, and the currents surrounded me; all your waves and billows passed over me. 
I said, 'I am driven out from before your eyes; yet I will again look toward your holy temple.' 
The waters closed around me up to my neck; the deep was all around me; seaweed wrapped around my head. 
I went down to the bases of the mountains; the earth with its bars closed upon me forever. Yet you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh, my God! 
When my soul fainted within me, I called Yahweh to mind; then my prayer came to you, to your holy temple. 
They give attention to useless gods while they forsake loving faithfulness. 
But as for me, I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving; I will fulfill that which I have vowed. Salvation comes from Yahweh!” 
Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited up Jonah upon the dry land.
