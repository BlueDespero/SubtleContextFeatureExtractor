Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A song of ascents. Blessed is everyone who honors Yahweh, who walks in his ways. 
What your hands provide, you will enjoy; you will be blessed and prosper. 
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in your house; your children will be like olive plants as they sit around your table. 
Yes, indeed, the man will be blessed who honors Yahweh. 
May Yahweh bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. 
May you live to see your children's children. May peace be on Israel.
