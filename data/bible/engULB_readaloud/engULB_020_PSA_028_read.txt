Psalms.
Chapter 28.
A psalm of David. To you, Yahweh, I cry out; my rock, do not ignore me. If you do not respond to me, I will join those who go down to the grave. 
Hear the sound of my pleading when I call for help from you, when I lift up my hands toward your most holy place! 
Do not drag me away with the wicked, those who do iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbors but have evil in their hearts. 
Give them what their deeds deserve and repay them what their wickedness demands, repay them for the work of their hands and render to them their due. 
Because they do not understand the deeds of Yahweh or the work of his hands, he will tear them down and never rebuild them. 
Blessed be Yahweh because he has heard the sound of my pleading! 
Yahweh is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and I will praise him with singing. 
Yahweh is the strength of his people, and he is the saving refuge of his anointed one. 
Save your people and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd and carry them forever.
