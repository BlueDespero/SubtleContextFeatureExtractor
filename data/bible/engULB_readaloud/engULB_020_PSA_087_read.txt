Psalms.
Chapter 87.
A psalm of the sons of Korah; a song. On the holy mount stands the city he founded; 
Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the tents of Jacob. 
Glorious things are said of you, city of God. Selah 
“I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers. See, there are Philistia, and Tyre, along with Cush— and will say, 'This one was born there.'” 
Of Zion it will be said, “Each of these was born in her; and the Most High himself will establish her.” 
Yahweh writes in the census book of the nations, “This one was born there.” Selah 
So also the singers and the dancers say together, “All my fountains are in you.”
