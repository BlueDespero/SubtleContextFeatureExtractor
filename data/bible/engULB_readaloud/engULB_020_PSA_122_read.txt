Psalms.
Chapter 122.
A song of ascents, of David. I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of Yahweh.” 
Jerusalem, our feet are standing within your gates! 
Jerusalem, built as a city carefully planned! 
The tribes go up to Jerusalem—the tribes of Yahweh— as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh. 
There thrones of judgment were set, thrones of the house of David. 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! “May those who love you have peace. 
May there be peace within the walls that defend you, and may they have peace within your fortresses.” 
For the sake of my brothers and my friends I will say, “May there be peace within you.” 
For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek good for you.
