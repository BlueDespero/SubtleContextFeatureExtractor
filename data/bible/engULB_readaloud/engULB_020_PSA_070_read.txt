Psalms.
Chapter 70.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David; to bring to remembrance. Save me, God! Yahweh, come quickly and help me. 
Let those who try to take my life be ashamed and humiliated; let them be turned back and brought to dishonor, those who take pleasure in my pain. 
Let them be turned back because of their shame, those who say, “Aha, aha.” 
Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation always say, “May God be praised.” 
But I am poor and needy; hurry to me, God; you are my help and you rescue me. Yahweh, do not delay.
