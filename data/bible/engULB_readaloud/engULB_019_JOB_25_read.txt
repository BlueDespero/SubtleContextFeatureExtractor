Job.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 
“Dominion and fear are with him; he makes order in his high places of heaven. 
Is there any end to the number of his armies? Upon whom does his light not shine? 
How then can man be righteous with God? How can he who is born of a woman be clean, acceptable to him? 
See, even the moon has no brightness to him; the stars are not pure in his sight. 
How much less man, who is a worm— a son of man, who is a worm!”
