Psalms.
Chapter 23.
A psalm of David. Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing. 
He makes me to lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside tranquil water. 
He brings back my life; he guides me along right paths for his name's sake. 
Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow, I will not fear harm since you are with me; your rod and your staff comfort me. 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you have anointed my head with oil; my cup runs over. 
Surely goodness and covenant faithfulness will pursue me all the days of my life; and I will live in the house of Yahweh for a very long time!
