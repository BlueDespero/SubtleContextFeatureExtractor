Psalms.
Chapter 129.
A song of ascents. “Often since my youth they have attacked me,” let Israel say. 
“Often since my youth they have attacked me, yet they have not defeated me. 
The plowers plowed on my back; they made their furrows long. 
Yahweh is righteous; he has cut the ropes of the wicked.” 
May they all be put to shame and turned back, those who hate Zion. 
May they be like the grass on the housetops that withers before it grows up, 
that cannot fill the reaper's hand or the chest of the one who binds bundles of grain together. 
May those who pass by not say, “May the blessing of Yahweh be on you; we bless you in the name of Yahweh.”
