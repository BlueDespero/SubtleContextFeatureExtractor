Psalms.
Chapter 20.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David. May Yahweh help you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you 
and send help from the holy place to support you from Zion. 
May he call to mind all your offerings and accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah 
May he grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans. 
Then we will rejoice in your victory, and, in the name of our God, we will raise banners. May Yahweh grant all your petitions. 
Now I know that Yahweh will rescue his anointed one; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the strength of his right hand that can rescue him. 
Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we call on Yahweh our God. 
They will be brought down and fall, but we will rise and stand upright! 
Yahweh, rescue the king; help us when we call.
