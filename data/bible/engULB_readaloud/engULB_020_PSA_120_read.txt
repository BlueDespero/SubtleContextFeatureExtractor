Psalms.
Chapter 120.
A song of ascents. In my distress I called out to Yahweh, and he answered me. 
Rescue my life, Yahweh, from those who lie with their lips and deceive with their tongues. 
How will he punish you, and what more will he do to you, you who have a lying tongue? 
He will punish you with the arrows of a warrior sharpened over burning coals of the broom tree. 
Woe is me because I temporarily live in Meshech; I lived previously among the tents of Kedar. 
For too long I have lived with those who hate peace. 
I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
