Psalms.
Chapter 3.
A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Yahweh, how many are my enemies! Many have risen against me. 
Many say about me, “There is no help for him from God.” Selah 
But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 
I lift up my voice to Yahweh, and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah 
I lay down and slept; I awoke, for Yahweh protected me. 
I will not be afraid of the multitudes of people who have set themselves against me on every side. 
Rise up, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you will hit all my enemies on the jaw; you will break the teeth of the wicked. 
Salvation comes from Yahweh. May your blessings be on your people. Selah
