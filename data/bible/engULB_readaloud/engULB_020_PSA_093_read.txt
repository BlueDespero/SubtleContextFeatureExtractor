Psalms.
Chapter 93.
Yahweh reigns; he is robed in majesty; Yahweh has clothed and girded himself with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved. 
Your throne is established from ancient times; you are from everlasting. 
The oceans rise, Yahweh; they have lifted up their voice; the oceans' waves crash and roar. 
Above the crashing of many waves, the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty. 
Your solemn commands are very trustworthy; holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forever.
