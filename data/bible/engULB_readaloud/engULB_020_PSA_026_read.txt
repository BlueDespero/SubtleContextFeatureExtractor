Psalms.
Chapter 26.
A psalm of David. Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked with integrity; I have trusted in Yahweh without wavering. 
Examine me, Yahweh, and test me; test the purity of my inner parts and my heart! 
For your covenant faithfulness is before my eyes, and I walk about in your faithfulness. 
I do not associate with deceitful people, nor do I mingle with dishonest people. 
I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I do not live with the wicked. 
I wash my hands in innocence, and I go around your altar, Yahweh, 
to sing a loud song of praise and report all your wonderful deeds. 
Yahweh, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory lives! 
Do not sweep me away with sinners, or my life with people who are bloodthirsty, 
in whose hands there is a plot, and whose right hand is full of bribes. 
But as for me, I will walk in integrity; redeem me and have mercy on me. 
My foot stands on level ground; in the assemblies will I bless Yahweh!
