Psalms.
Chapter 121.
A song of ascents. I will lift up my eyes to the mountains. From where will my help come? 
My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth. 
He will not allow your foot to slip; he who protects you will not slumber. 
See, the guardian of Israel never slumbers or sleeps. 
Yahweh is your guardian; Yahweh is the shade at your right hand. 
The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 
Yahweh will protect you from all harm, and he will protect your life. 
Yahweh will protect you in all you do now and forevermore.
