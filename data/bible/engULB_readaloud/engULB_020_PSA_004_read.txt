Psalms.
Chapter 4.
For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A psalm of David. Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness; give me room when I am hemmed in. Have mercy on me and listen to my prayer. 
You people, how long will you turn my honor into shame? How long will you love that which is worthless and seek after lies? Selah 
But know that Yahweh sets apart the godly for himself. Yahweh will hear when I call to him. 
Tremble in fear, but do not sin! Meditate in your heart on your bed and be silent. Selah 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in Yahweh. 
Many say, “Who will show us anything good?” Yahweh, lift up the light of your face on us. 
You have given my heart more gladness than others have when their grain and new wine abound. 
It is in peace that I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Yahweh, make me safe and secure.
