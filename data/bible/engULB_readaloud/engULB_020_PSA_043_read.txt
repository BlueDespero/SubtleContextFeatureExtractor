Psalms.
Chapter 43.
Bring me justice, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. 
For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I go about in mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 
Oh, send out your light and your truth, let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling. 
Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy. I will praise you with the harp, God, my God. 
Why are you bowed down, my soul? Why are you upset within me? Hope in God, for again I will praise him who is my salvation and my God.
