Job.
Chapter 26.
Then Job answered and said, 
“How you have helped one who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! 
How you have advised one who has no wisdom and announced to him sound knowledge! 
With whose help have you spoken these words? Whose spirit was it that came out from you? 
The dead are made to tremble, those who are beneath the waters and all who dwell in them. 
Sheol is naked before God; destruction itself has no covering against him. 
He stretches out the northern skies over the empty space, and he hangs the earth over nothing. 
He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, but the clouds are not torn under them. 
He covers the surface of the moon and spreads his clouds on it. 
He has engraved a circular boundary on the surface of the waters as the line between light and darkness. 
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke. 
He calmed the sea with his power; by his understanding he shattered Rahab. 
By his breath he made the skies clear; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 
See, these are but the fringes of his ways; how small a whisper do we hear of him! Who can understand the thunder of his power?”
