Psalms.
Chapter 46.
For the chief musician. A psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change, though the mountains should be shaken into the heart of the seas, 
though its waters roar and rage, and though the mountains tremble with their swelling. Selah 
There is a river whose streams make the city of God happy, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 
God is in the middle of her; she will not be moved; God will help her, and he will do so at the dawn of morning. 
The nations raged and the kingdoms were shaken; he lifted up his voice, and the earth melted. 
Yahweh of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah 
Come, behold the deeds of Yahweh, the destruction he has caused on earth. 
He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; he breaks the bow and cuts the spear into pieces; he burns up the shields. 
Be quiet and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on the earth. 
Yahweh of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
