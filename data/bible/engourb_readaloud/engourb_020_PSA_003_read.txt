Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 3.
Adonai , how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me. 
Many there are who say of my soul, “There is no yishu'ah ·salvation· for him in God.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude· 
But you, Adonai , are a shield around me, my kavod ·weighty glory·, and the one who lifts up my head. 
I cry to Adonai with my voice, and he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude· 
I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Adonai sustains me. 
I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side. 
Arise, Adonai ! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked. 
Yishu'ah ·Salvation· belongs to Adonai . Your blessing be on your people. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·
