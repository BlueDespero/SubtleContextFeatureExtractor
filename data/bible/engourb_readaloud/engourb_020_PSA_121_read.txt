Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 121.
I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from? 
My help comes from Adonai , who made heaven and earth. 
He will not allow your foot to be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber. 
Behold, he who keeps Israel God prevails will neither slumber nor sleep. 
Adonai is your keeper. Adonai is your shade on your right hand. 
The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 
Adonai will keep you from all evil. He will keep your soul. 
Adonai will keep your going out and your coming in, from this time forward, and forever more.
