Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 95.
Oh come, let’s sing to Adonai . Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our yesha' ·salvation·! 
Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let’s extol him with songs! 
For Adonai is a great God, a great King above all deities. 
In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his. 
The sea is his, and he made it. His hands formed the dry land. 
Oh come, let’s worship and hawa ·bow low, prostrate·. Let’s kneel before Yahweh 'Oseinu Yahweh our Maker, 
for he is our God. We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep in his care. Today, oh that you would sh'ma ·hear obey· his voice! 
Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah Quarreling, as in the day of Massah Testing in the wilderness, 
when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work. 
Forty long years I loathed that generation, and said, “This is a people that errors in their heart. They have not known my ways.” 
Therefore I swore in my wrath, “They won’t enter into my rest.”
