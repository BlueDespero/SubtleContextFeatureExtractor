Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 61.
Sh'ma ·Hear obey· my cry, God. Listen to my prayer. 
From the end of the earth, I will call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy. 
I will dwell in your tent forever. I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
For you, God, have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 
You will prolong the king’s life; his years shall be for generations. 
He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever. Appoint your cheshed ·loving-kindness· and truth, that they may preserve him. 
So I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily.
