Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 92.
It is a good thing to yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai , to sing zahmar ·musical praise· to your name, Most High; 
to proclaim your cheshed ·loving-kindness· in the morning, and your faithfulness every night, 
with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the lyre's solemn higgayon ·meditation·. 
For you, Adonai , have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands. 
How great are your works, Adonai ! Your thoughts are very deep. 
A senseless man does not know, neither does a fool understand this: 
though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever. 
But you, Adonai , are on high forever more. 
For, behold, your enemies, Adonai , for, behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evildoers will be scattered. 
But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil. 
My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· of the wicked enemies who rise up against me. 
The upright shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
They are planted in Adonai ’s house. They will flourish in our God’s courts. 
They will still produce fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green, 
to show that Adonai is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
