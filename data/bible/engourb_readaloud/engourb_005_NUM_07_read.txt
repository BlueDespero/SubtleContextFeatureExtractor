On the day that Moses Drawn out had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, with all its furniture, and the altar with all its utensils, and had anointed and sanctified them; 
the princes of Israel God prevails, the heads of their fathers’ houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were counted: 
and they brought their offering before Adonai , six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle. 
Adonai spoke to Moses Drawn out, saying, 
“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites Descendants of United with, to every man according to his service.” 
Moses Drawn out took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites Descendants of United with. 
He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron Light-bringer the priest.
