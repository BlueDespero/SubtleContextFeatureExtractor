Genesis [Origin].
Chapter 24.
Abraham Father of a multitude was old, and well stricken in age. Adonai had blessed Abraham Father of a multitude in all things. 
Abraham Father of a multitude said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh. 
I will make you swear by Adonai , the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites Descendants of Humbled, among whom I live. 
But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac Laughter.” 
The servant said to him, “What if the woman is not willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?” 
Abraham Father of a multitude said to him, “Beware that you don’t bring my son there again. 
Adonai , the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your offspring. He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 
If the woman is not willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not bring my son there again.” 
The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham Father of a multitude his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. (3) 
The servant took ten camels, of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 
He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. 
He said, “Adonai , the God of my master Abraham Father of a multitude, please give me success today, and show cheshed ·loving-kindness· to my master Abraham Father of a multitude. 
Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. 
Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’ —let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac Laughter. By this I will know that you have shown cheshed ·loving-kindness· to my master.” 
Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah Securely bound came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham Father of a multitude’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder. 
The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. 
The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.” 
She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink. 
When she had done giving him drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking.” 
She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. 
The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Adonai had made his journey prosperous or not. 
As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel 0.2 oz; 5.67 g, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels 4 oz; 113.4 g of gold, 
and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?” 
She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.” 
The man bowed his head, and worshiped Adonai . (4) 
He said, “Blessed be Adonai , the God of my master Abraham Father of a multitude, who has not forsaken his cheshed ·loving-kindness· and his truth toward my master. As for me, Adonai has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.” 
The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. 
Rebekah Securely bound had a brother, and his name was Laban White. Laban White ran out to the man, to the spring. 
When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of Rebekah Securely bound his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. 
He said, “Come in, you blessed of Adonai . Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.” 
The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 
Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” He said, “Speak on.” 
He said, “I am Abraham Father of a multitude’s servant. 
Adonai has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys. 
Sarah Princess, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him. 
My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites Descendants of Humbled, in whose land I live, 
but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ 
I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ 
He said to me, ‘Adonai , before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house. 
Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’ 
I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Adonai , the God of my master Abraham Father of a multitude, if now you do prosper my way which I go— 
behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,” 
and she will tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”— let her be the woman whom Adonai has appointed for my master’s son.’ 
Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah Securely bound came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ 
She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. 
I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands. 
I bowed my head, and worshiped Adonai , and blessed Adonai , the God of my master Abraham Father of a multitude, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son. 
Now if you will deal with cheshed ·loving-kindness· and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.” 
Then Laban White and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Adonai . We can’t speak to you bad or good. 
Behold, Rebekah Securely bound is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Adonai has spoken.” 
When Abraham Father of a multitude’s servant sh'ma ·heard obeyed· their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Adonai . (5) 
The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah Securely bound. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. 
They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.” 
Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.” 
He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Adonai has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.” 
They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.” 
They called Rebekah Securely bound, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.” 
They sent away Rebekah Securely bound, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham Father of a multitude’s servant, and his men. 
They blessed Rebekah Securely bound, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.” 
Rebekah Securely bound arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah Securely bound, and went his way. 
Isaac Laughter came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi Well of the one who lives and sees, for he lived in the land of the South. 
Isaac Laughter went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming. 
Rebekah Securely bound lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac Laughter, she dismounted from the camel. 
She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” She took her veil, and covered herself. 
The servant told Isaac Laughter all the things that he had done. 
Isaac Laughter brought her into his mother Sarah Princess’s tent, and took Rebekah Securely bound, and she became his wife. He 'ahav ·affectionately loved· her. Isaac Laughter was comforted after his mother’s death.
