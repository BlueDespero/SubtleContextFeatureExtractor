Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 29.
Ascribe to Adonai , you sons of the mighty, ascribe to Adonai kavod ·weighty glory· and strength. 
Ascribe to Adonai the kavod ·weighty glory· due to his name. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship Adonai in holy array. 
Adonai ’s voice is on the waters. The God of kavod ·weighty glory· thunders, even Adonai on many waters. 
Adonai ’s voice is powerful. Adonai ’s voice is full of majesty. 
Adonai ’s voice breaks the cedars. Yes, Adonai breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 
He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox. 
Adonai ’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning. 
Adonai ’s voice shakes the wilderness. Adonai shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 
Adonai ’s voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, “Kavod ·Weighty glory·!” 
Adonai sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, Adonai sits as King forever. 
Adonai will give strength to his people. Adonai will bless his people with peace.
