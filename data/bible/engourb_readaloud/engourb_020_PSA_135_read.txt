Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 135.
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise Adonai ’s name! Praise him, you servants of Adonai , 
you who stand in Adonai ’s house, in the courts of our God’s house. 
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·, for Adonai is good. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to his name, for that is pleasant. 
For Yah has chosen Jacob Supplanter for himself; Israel God prevails for his own segulah ·special treasure·. 
For I know that Adonai is great, that our Lord is above all deities. 
Whatever Adonai pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps; 
who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings the wind out of his treasuries; 
Who struck the firstborn of Egypt Abode of slavery, both of man and animal; 
Who sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt Abode of slavery, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants; 
who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings, 
Sihon king of the Amorites Descendants of Talkers, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan Humbled, 
and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel God prevails, his people. 
Your name, Adonai , endures forever; your renown, Adonai , throughout all generations. 
For Adonai will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants. 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 
They have mouths, but they can’t speak. They have eyes, but they can’t see. 
They have ears, but they can’t hear; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them. 
House of Israel God prevails, praise Adonai ! House of Aaron Light-bringer, praise Adonai ! 
House of Levi United with, praise Adonai ! You who fear Adonai, praise Adonai ! 
Blessed be Adonai from Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, Who dwells at Jerusalem City of peace. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
