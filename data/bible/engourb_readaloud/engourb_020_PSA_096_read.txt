Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 96.
Sing to Adonai a new song! Sing to Adonai , all the earth. 
Sing to Adonai ! Bless his name! Proclaim his yishu'ah ·salvation· from day to day! 
Declare his kavod ·weighty glory· among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 
For great is Adonai , and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all deities. 
For all the deities of the peoples are idols, but Adonai made the heavens. 
Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
Ascribe to Adonai , you families of nations, ascribe to Adonai kavod ·weighty glory· and strength. 
Ascribe to Adonai the kavod ·weighty glory· due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship Adonai in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth. 
Say among the nations, “Adonai reigns.” The world is also established. It can’t be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity. 
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness! 
Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy 
before Adonai ; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with his truth.
