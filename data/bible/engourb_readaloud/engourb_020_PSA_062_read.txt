Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 62.
My soul rests in God alone. My yishu'ah ·salvation· comes from him. 
He alone is my rock and my yishu'ah ·salvation·, my fortress— I will never be greatly shaken. 
How long will you assault a man, would all of you throw him down, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? 
They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation is from him. 
He alone is my rock and my yishu'ah ·salvation·, my fortress. I will not be shaken. 
With God is my yesha' ·salvation· and my kavod ·weighty glory·. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 
Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Surely men of low degree are just a breath, and men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up. They are together lighter than a breath. 
Don’t trust in oppression. Don’t become vain in robbery. If riches increase, don’t set your heart on them. 
God has spoken once; twice I have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· this, that power belongs to God. 
Also to you, Lord, belongs cheshed ·loving-kindness·, for you reward every man according to his work.
