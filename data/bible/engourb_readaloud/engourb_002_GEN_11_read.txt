Genesis [Origin].
Chapter 11.
The whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
As they traveled east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there. 
They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. 
They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.” 
Adonai came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built. 
Adonai said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do. 
Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not sh'ma ·hear understand obey· one another’s speech.” 
So Adonai scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city. 
Therefore its name was called Babel Confusion, because there Adonai confused the language of all the earth. From there, Adonai scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.

Avram Exalted father and Nahor married wives. The name of Avram Exalted father’s wife was Sarai Mockery, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran Mountaineer who was also the father of Iscah. 
Sarai Mockery was barren. She had no child.

They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan Humbled. They came to Haran Mountaineer and lived there.
