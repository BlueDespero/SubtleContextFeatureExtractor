Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 128.
Blessed is everyone who fears Adonai , who walks in his ways. 
For you will eat the labor of your hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you. 
Your wife will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of your house; your children like olive plants, around your table. 
Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Adonai . 
May Adonai bless you out of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, and may you see the good of Jerusalem City of peace all the days of your life. 
Yes, may you see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel God prevails.
