Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 133.
See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity! 
It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron Light-bringer’s beard; that came down on the edge of his robes; 
like the dew of Hermon Devoted to destruction, that comes down on the hills of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking: for there Adonai enjoined blessing, even life forever more.
