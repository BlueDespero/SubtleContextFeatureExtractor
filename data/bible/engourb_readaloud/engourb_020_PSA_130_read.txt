Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 130.
Out of the depths I have cried to you, Adonai . 
Lord, sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions. 
If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 
But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared. 
I wait for Adonai . My soul waits. I hope in his word. 
My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning; more than watchmen for the morning. 
Israel God prevails, hope in Adonai , for with Adonai there is cheshed ·loving-kindness·. With him is abundant redemption. 
He will redeem Israel God prevails from all their sins.
