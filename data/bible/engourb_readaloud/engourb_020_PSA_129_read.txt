Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 129.
Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel God prevails now say, 
many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me. 
The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long. 
Adonai is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked. 
Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion Mountain ridge, Marking. 
Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up; 
with which the reaper does not fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom. 
Neither do those who go by say, “The blessing of Adonai be on you. We bless you in Adonai ’s name.”
