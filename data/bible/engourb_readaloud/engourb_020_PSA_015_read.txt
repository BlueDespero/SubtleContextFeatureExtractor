Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 15.
Adonai , who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill? 
He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart; 
He who does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man; 
In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Adonai ; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change; 
he who does not lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
