He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. It was square. Its length was five cubits 7.5 ft; 22.9 m, its width was five cubits 7.5 ft; 22.9 m, and its height was three cubits 4.5 ft; 13.7 m. 
He made its horns on its four corners. Its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze. 
He made all the utensils of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the fire pans. He made all its utensils of bronze. 
He made for the altar a grating of a network of bronze, under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up. 
He cast four rings for the four ends of bronze grating, to be places for the poles. 
He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze. 
He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks. 
He made the basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, out of the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
He made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits 150 ft; 457.2 m; 
their pillars were twenty cubits 30 ft; 91.44 m, and their sockets twenty cubits 30 ft; 91.44 m, of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits 22.5 ft; 68.58 m; their pillars three cubits 4.5 ft; 13.7 m, and their sockets three cubits 4.5 ft; 13.7 m.

The sockets for the pillars were of bronze. The hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. (LY: Maftir ·Conclusion·) 
The screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen. Twenty cubits 30 ft; 91.44 m was the length, and the height in the width was five cubits 7.5 ft; 22.9 m, like to the hangings of the court. 
Their pillars were four cubits 6 ft; 18.3 m, and their sockets four cubits 6 ft; 18.3 m, of bronze; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets, of silver. 
All the pins of the tabernacle, and around the court, were of bronze. 
This is the amount of material used for the tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were counted, as Moses Drawn out ordered, for the service of the Levites Descendants of United with, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron Light-bringer the priest. 
Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah Praised, made all that Adonai enjoined Moses Drawn out. 
With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan He judged, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen. 
All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred thirty shekels 12 oz; 3/4 lb; 340.2 g, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 0.4oz; 11.34 g). 
The silver of those who were counted of the congregation was one hundred talents 300,000 shekels; 7,500 lb; 3,402 kg, and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels 44.375 lb; 20.129 kg, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 0.4oz; 11.34 g): 
a beka 1/5 oz; 5.67 g a head, that is, half a shekel 0.2 oz; 5.67 g, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 0.4oz; 11.34 g), for everyone who passed over to those who were counted, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men. 
The one hundred talents 300,000 sheckles; 7,500 lb; 3,402 kg of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the one hundred talents 300,000 sheckles; 7,500 lb; 3,402 kg, one talent 3,000 sheckles; 75 lb; 34.02 kg for a socket. 
Of the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels 44.38 lb; 20.13 kg he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their capitals, and made chasak ·joints for binding·. 
The bronze of the offering was seventy talents 210,000 shekels; 5,250 lb; 2,381.4 kg, and two thousand four hundred shekels 60 lb; 27.22 kg.
