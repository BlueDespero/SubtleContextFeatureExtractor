Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 145.
I will exalt you, my God, the King. I will praise your name forever and ever. 
Every day I will praise you. I will extol your name forever and ever. 
Great is Adonai , and greatly to be praised! His greatness is unsearchable. 
One generation will commend your works to another, and will declare your mighty acts. 
Of the glorious majesty of your kavod ·weighty glory·, of your wondrous works, I will meditate. 
Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts. I will declare your greatness. 
They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will sing of your righteousness. 
Adonai is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of great cheshed ·loving-kindness·. 
Adonai is good to all. His tender racham ·merciful love· is over all his works. 
All your works will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Adonai . Your saints will extol you. 
They will speak of the kavod ·weighty glory· of your kingdom, and talk about your power; 
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the kavod ·weighty glory· of the majesty of his kingdom. 
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. Your dominion endures throughout all generations. Adonai is faithful in all his words, and loving in all his deeds. 
Adonai upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down. 
The eyes of all wait for you. You give them their food in due season. 
You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing. 
Adonai is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works. 
Adonai is near to all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. 
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him. He also will sh'ma ·hear obey· their cry, and will save them. 
Adonai preserves all those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· him, but all the wicked he will destroy. 
My mouth will speak the tehilah ·praise song· of Adonai . Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
