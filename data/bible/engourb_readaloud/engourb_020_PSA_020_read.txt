Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 20.
May Adonai answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob Supplanter set you up on high, 
send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, 
remember all your offerings, and accept your burned sacrifice. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
May He grant you your heart’s desire, and fulfill all your counsel. 
We will triumph in your yishu'ah ·salvation·. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Adonai grant all your requests. 
Now I know that Adonai saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, with the yesha' ·saving· strength of his right hand. 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust the name of Yahweh Eloheikhem Yahweh our God. 
They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright. 
Save, Adonai ! Let the King answer us when we call!
