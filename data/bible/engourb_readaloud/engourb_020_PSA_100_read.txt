Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 100.
Shout for joy to Adonai , all you lands! 
Abad ·Serve· Adonai with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. 
Know that Adonai , he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with tehilahot ·praise songs·. Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to him, and bless his name. 
For Adonai is good. His cheshed ·loving-kindness· endures forever, his faithfulness to all generations.
