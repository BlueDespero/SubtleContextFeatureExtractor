Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 81.
Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob Supplanter! 
Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp. 
Blow the shofar ·ram horn· at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. 
For it is a statute for Israel God prevails, an judgement of the God of Jacob Supplanter. 
He appointed it in Joseph May he add for a testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt Abode of slavery, I sh'ma ·heard obeyed· a language that I didn’t know. 
“I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were freed from the basket. 
You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah Quarreling.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
“Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel God prevails, if you would listen to me! 
There shall be no strange deity in you, neither shall you hawa ·bow low, prostrate· to worship any foreign deity. 
I am Adonai , your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt Abode of slavery. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
But my people didn’t sh'ma ·hear obey· my voice. Israel God prevails desired none of me. 
So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels. 
Oh that my people would sh'ma ·hear obey· me, that Israel God prevails would walk in my ways! 
I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. 
The haters of Adonai would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever. 
But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
