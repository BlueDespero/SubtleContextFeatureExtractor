Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 99.
Adonai reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved. 
Adonai is great in Zion Mountain ridge, Marking. He is high above all the peoples. 
Let them yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your great and awesome name. He is Holy! 
The King’s strength also 'ahav ·affectionately loves· mishpat ·justice·. You do establish equity. You execute mishpat ·justice· and righteousness in Jacob Supplanter. 
Exalt Yahweh Eloheikhem Yahweh our God. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship at his footstool. He is Holy! 
Moses Drawn out and Aaron Light-bringer were among his priests, Samuel among those who call on his name; they called on Adonai , and he answered them. 
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them. 
You answered them, Yahweh Eloheikhem Yahweh our God. You are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their doings. 
Exalt Adonai , our God. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship at his holy hill, for Adonai , our God, is holy!
