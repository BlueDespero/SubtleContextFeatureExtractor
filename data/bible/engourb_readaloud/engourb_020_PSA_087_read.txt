Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 87.
His foundation is in the holy mountains. 
Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves· the gates of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking more than all the dwellings of Jacob Supplanter. 
Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
I will record Rahab and Babylon Confusion among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: “This one was born there.” 
Yes, of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;” haElyon the Most High himself will establish her. 
Adonai will count, when he writes up the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Those who sing as well as those who dance say, “All my springs are in you.”
