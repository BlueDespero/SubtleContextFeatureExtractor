Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 60.
God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again. 
You have made the land tremble. You have torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes. 
You have shown your people hard things. You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger. 
You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
So that your yadid ·beloved· may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us. 
God has spoken from his sanctuary: “I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Sukkot. 
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh Causing to forget is mine. Ephraim Fruit also is the defense of my head. Judah Praised is my scepter. 
Moab From father is my wash basin. I will throw my shoe on Edom Red. I shout in triumph over Philistia.” 
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom Red? 
Haven’t you, God, rejected us? You don’t go out with our armies, God. 
Give us help against the adversary, for the help of man is vain. 
Through God we shall do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
