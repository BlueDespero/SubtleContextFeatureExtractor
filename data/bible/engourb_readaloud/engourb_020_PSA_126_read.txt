Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 126.
When Adonai brought back those who teshuvah ·completely returned· to Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, we were like those who dream. 
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, “Adonai has done great things for them.” 
Adonai has done great things for us, and we are glad. 
Restore our fortunes again, Adonai , like the streams in the Negev. 
Those who sow in tears will reap in joy. 
He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
