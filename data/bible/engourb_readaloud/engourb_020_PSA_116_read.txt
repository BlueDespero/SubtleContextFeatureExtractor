Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 116.
I 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai , because he sh'ma ·hears obeys· my voice, and my cries for mercy. 
Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 
The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol ·Place of the dead· got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow. 
Then I called on Adonai ’s name: “Adonai , I beg you, deliver my soul.” 
Adonai is gracious and righteous. Yes, our God is racham ·merciful love·. 
Adonai preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me. 
Teshuvah ·Completely return· to your rest, my soul, for Adonai has dealt bountifully with you. 
For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
I will walk before Adonai in the land of the living. 
I believed, therefore I said, “I was greatly afflicted.” 
I said in my haste, “All men are liars.” 
What will I give to Adonai for all his benefits toward me? 
I will take the cup of yishu'ah ·salvation·, and call on Adonai ’s name. 
I will pay my vows to Adonai , yes, in the presence of all his people. 
Precious in Adonai ’s sight is the death of his saints. 
Adonai , truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your servant. You have freed me from my chains. 
I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on Adonai ’s name. 
I will pay my vows to Adonai , yes, in the presence of all his people, 
in the courts of Adonai ’s house, in the middle of you, Jerusalem City of peace. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
