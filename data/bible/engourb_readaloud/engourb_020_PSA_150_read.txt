Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 150.
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise God in his sanctuary! Praise him in his heavens for his acts of power! 
Praise him for his mighty acts! Praise him according to his excellent greatness! 
Praise him with the sounding of the shofar ·ram horn·! Praise him with harp and lyre! 
Praise him with tambourine and dancing! Praise him with stringed instruments and flute! 
Praise him with loud cymbals! Praise him with resounding cymbals! 
Let everything that has breath Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
