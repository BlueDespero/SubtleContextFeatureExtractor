Isaiah / Yesha'yahu.
Chapter 20.
In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria Level plain sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it; 
at that time Adonai spoke by Isaiah Salvation of Yah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist, and take your shoes from off your feet.” He did so, walking naked and barefoot. 
Adonai said, “As my servant Isaiah Salvation of Yah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt Abode of slavery and concerning Ethiopia, 
so the king of Assyria Level plain will lead away the captives of Egypt Abode of slavery and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt Abode of slavery. 
They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt Abode of slavery their glory. 
The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria Level plain. And we, how will we escape?’”
