Esther.
Chapter 10.
King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts. 
All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great amongst the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and promoted the welfare of their descendants.
