Zechariah.
Chapter 6.
Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze. 
The first chariot had red horses. The second chariot had black horses, 
the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses. 
Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
The messenger answered me, “These are the four winds of heaven going out after standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
The black horses are going towards the north country and the white towards the west and the dappled towards the south country.” 
The strong horses came out, and were impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” and they did so. 
Then he cried out to me, “The horses that went to the north country will quiet my spirit in the north country.” 
Now this message of the Lord came to me: 
Take the gifts from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah. 
Take their silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. 
Tell him: “Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple of the Lord. 
He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his throne, receiving the honour due to a king. A priest will stand by his throne and they will work together in peace and harmony. 
The crown will be a memorial in the temple of the Lord for Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah. 
People from far away will come and build in the temple of the Lord and you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.”
