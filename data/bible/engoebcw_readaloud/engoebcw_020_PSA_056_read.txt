Psalms.
Chapter 56.
For the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. O God, be gracious to me, for people trample upon me, all the day righting and pressing me. 
All the day enemies trample me; many there be who contend with me bitterly. 
In the day of my terror I trust in you. 
In God I maintain my cause, in God I fearlessly trust. What can flesh do to me? 
They torture me all the day, they ceaselessly plan to hurt me, 
banded together in secret, watching my every step, as those who hope for my death. 
Pay them out for their sin, O God, hurl down the strong in your anger. 
You yourself count my wanderings. Put in your bottle my tears are they not in your book? 
Then shall my foes be turned back in the day that I call. Of this I am sure, because God is for me. 
In God I maintain my cause, in the Lord I maintain my cause. 
In God I fearlessly trust, what can people do to me? 
Your vows are upon me, O God, I will render thank-offerings to you; 
because you have saved me from death, my feet from stumbling, to the end that I walk before God in the light of the living.
