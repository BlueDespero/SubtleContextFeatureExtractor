Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Hallelujah. Sing to the Lord a new song, sound his praise where the faithful are gathered. 
Let Israel rejoice in its maker, sons of Zion exult in their king. 
Let them praise his name in the dance, making music with lyre and with timbrel. 
For the Lord delights in his people, adorning the humble with victory. 
Let the faithful exult and extol him with glad ringing cries all night long. 
High praises of God in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand: 
on the heathen to execute vengeance, and chastisement sore on the nations, 
binding their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron, 
to execute on them the doom that is written. This is the glory of all his faithful. Hallelujah.
