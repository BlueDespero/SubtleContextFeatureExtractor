Ezekiel.
Chapter 2.
His appearance was of the likeness of the glory of YHWH, and I see, and fall on my face, and I hear a voice speaking, and He says to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I speak with you.” 
And the Spirit comes into me when He has spoken to me, and causes me to stand on my feet, and I hear Him who is speaking to me. 
And He says to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to rebelling nations who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, to this very day. 
And the sons are brazen-faced and hard-hearted to whom I am sending you, and you have said to them: Thus said Lord YHWH. 
And they—whether they hear, or whether they refrain, for they are a house of rebellion—have known that a prophet has been in their midst. 
And you, son of man, you are not afraid of them, indeed, you are not afraid of their words, for briers and thorns are with you, and you are dwelling near scorpions, you are not afraid of their words, and you are not frightened of their faces, for they are a house of rebellion, 
and you have spoken My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refrain, for they are a rebellion. 
And you, son of man, hear that which I am speaking to you; do not be of rebellion like the house of rebellion, open your mouth and eat that which I am giving to you.” 
And I look, and behold, a hand is sent forth to me, and behold, a roll of a scroll is in it, 
and He spreads it before me, and it is written in front and behind, and written on it are lamentations, and mourning, and woe!
