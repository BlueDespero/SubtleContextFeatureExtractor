Psalms.
Chapter 28.
BY DAVID. To You, O YHWH, I call, || My rock, do not be silent to me! Lest You are silent to me, || And I have been compared || With those going down to the pit. 
Hear the voice of my supplications, || In my crying to You, || In my lifting up my hands toward your holy oracle. 
Do not draw me with the wicked, || And with workers of iniquity, || Speaking peace with their neighbors, || And evil in their heart. 
Give to them according to their acting, || And according to the evil of their doings. Give to them according to the work of their hands. Return their deed to them. 
For they do not attend to the doing of YHWH, || And to the work of His hands. He throws them down, || And does not build them up. 
Blessed is YHWH, || For He has heard the voice of my supplications. 
YHWH is my strength, and my shield, || In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exults, || And I thank Him with my song. 
YHWH is strength to him, || Indeed, the strength of the salvation of His anointed is He. 
Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance, || And feed them, and carry them for all time!
