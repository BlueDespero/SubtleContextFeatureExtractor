Proverbs.
Chapter 30.
Words of Agur, son of Jakeh, the burden, a declaration of the man to Ithiel—to Ithiel and Ucal: I have wearied myself for God, || I have wearied myself for God, and am consumed. 
For I am more brutish than anyone, || And do not have the understanding of a man. 
Nor have I learned wisdom, || Yet I know the knowledge of the Holy Ones. 
Who went up to the heavens, and comes down? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound waters in a garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What is His Name? And what is His Son’s Name? Surely you know! 
Every saying of God is tried, || He is a shield to those trusting in Him. 
Do not add to His words, lest He reason with you, || And you have been found false. 
Two things I have asked from You, || Do not withhold from me before I die. 
Put vanity and a lying word far from me, || Do not give poverty or wealth to me, || Cause me to eat the bread of my portion, 
Lest I become satiated, and have denied, || And have said, “Who is YHWH?” And lest I am poor, and have stolen, || And have laid hold of the Name of my God. 
Do not accuse a servant to his lord, || Lest he disapprove of you, and you are found guilty. 
A generation lightly esteems their father, || And does not bless their mother. 
A generation—pure in their own eyes, || But not washed from their own filth. 
A generation—how high are their eyes, || Indeed, their eyelids are lifted up. 
A generation—their teeth are swords, || And their jaw-teeth are knives, || To consume the poor from earth, || And the needy from among men. 
To the leech are two daughters—Give! Give! Behold, three things are not satisfied, || Four have not said “Sufficiency”; 
Sheol, and a restrained womb, || Earth—it is not satisfied with water, || And fire—it has not said, “Sufficiency,” 
An eye that mocks at a father, || And despises to obey a mother, || Ravens of the valley dig it out, || And young eagles eat it. 
Three things have been too wonderful for me, || Indeed, four that I have not known: 
The way of the eagle in the heavens, || The way of a serpent on a rock, || The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, || And the way of a man in youth. 
So—the way of an adulterous woman, || She has eaten and has wiped her mouth, || And has said, “I have not done iniquity.” 
For three things has earth been troubled, || And for four—it is not able to bear: 
For a servant when he reigns, || And a fool when he is satisfied with bread, 
For a hated one when she rules, || And a maidservant when she succeeds her mistress. 
Four are little ones of earth, || And they are made wiser than the wise: 
The ants are a people not strong, || And they prepare their food in summer, 
hyraxes are a people not strong, || And they place their house in a rock, 
There is no king to the locust, || And it goes out—each one shouting, 
A spider with two hands takes hold, || And is in the palaces of a king. 
There are three going well, || Indeed, four are good in going: 
An old lion—mighty among beasts, || That does not turn back from the face of any, 
A girt one of the loins, || Also a male goat, || And a king—troops with him. 
If you have been foolish in lifting yourself up, || And if you have devised evil—hand to mouth! 
For the churning of milk brings out butter, || And the wringing of the nose brings out blood, || And the forcing of anger brings out strife!
