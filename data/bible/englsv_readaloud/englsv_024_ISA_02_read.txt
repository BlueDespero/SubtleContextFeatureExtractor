Isaiah.
Chapter 2.
The thing that Isaiah son of Amoz has seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 
And it has come to pass, || In the latter end of the days, || The mountain of YHWH’s house is established, || Above the top of the mountains, || And it has been lifted up above the heights, || And all the nations have flowed to it. 
And many peoples have gone and said, “Come, and we go up to the mountain of YHWH, || To the house of the God of Jacob, || And He teaches us of His ways, || And we walk in His paths, || For a law goes forth from Zion, || And a word of YHWH from Jerusalem. 
And He has judged between the nations, || And has given a decision to many peoples, || And they have beat their swords to plowshares, || And their spears to pruning-hooks, || Nation does not lift up sword to nation, || Nor do they learn anymore—war. 
O house of Jacob, come, || And we walk in the light of YHWH.” 
For You have left Your people, the house of Jacob. For they have been filled from the east, || And are sorcerers like the Philistines, || And strike hands with the children of strangers. 
And its land is full of silver and gold, || And there is no end to its treasures, || And its land is full of horses, || And there is no end to its chariots, 
And its land is full of idols, || It bows itself to the work of its hands, || To that which its fingers have made, 
And the low bows down, and the high is humbled, || And You do not accept them. 
Enter into a rock, and be hidden in dust, || Because of the fear of YHWH, || And because of the honor of His excellence. 
The haughty eyes of man have been humbled, || And the loftiness of men has been bowed down, || And YHWH alone has been set on high in that day. 
For a day is to YHWH of Hosts, || For every proud and high one, || And for every lifted up and low one, 
And for all cedars of Lebanon, || The high and the exalted ones, || And for all oaks of Bashan, 
And for all the high mountains, || And for all the exalted heights, 
And for every high tower, || And for every fortified wall, 
And for all ships of Tarshish, || And for all desirable pictures. 
And the haughtiness of man has been bowed down, || And the loftiness of men humbled, || And YHWH alone has been set on high in that day. 
And the idols—they completely pass away. 
And men have entered into caverns of rocks, || And into caves of dust, || Because of the fear of YHWH, || And because of the honor of His excellence, || In His rising to terrify the earth. 
In that day man casts his idols of silver, || And his idols of gold, || That they have made for him to worship, || To moles, and to bats, 
To enter into cavities of the rocks, || And into clefts of the high places, || Because of the fear of YHWH, || And because of the honor of His excellence, || In His rising to terrify the earth. 
Cease yourselves from man, || Whose breath is in his nostrils, || For—in what is he esteemed?
