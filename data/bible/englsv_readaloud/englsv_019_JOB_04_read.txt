Job.
Chapter 4.
And Eliphaz the Temanite answers and says: 
“Has one tried a word with you? You are weary! And who is able to keep in words? 
Behold, you have instructed many, || And feeble hands you make strong. 
Your words raise up the stumbling one, || And you strengthen bowing knees. 
But now, it comes to you, || And you are weary; It strikes to you, and you are troubled. 
Is your reverence not your confidence? Your hope—the perfection of your ways? 
Now remember, || Who, being innocent, has perished? And where have the upright been cut off? 
As I have seen—plowers of iniquity, || And sowers of misery, reap it! 
From the breath of God they perish, || And from the spirit of His anger are consumed. 
The roaring of a lion, || And the voice of a fierce lion, || And teeth of young lions have been broken. 
An old lion is perishing without prey, || And the whelps of the lioness separate. 
And a thing is secretly brought to me, || And my ear receives a little of it. 
In thoughts from visions of the night, || In the falling of deep sleep on men, 
Fear has met me, and trembling, || And the multitude of my bones caused to fear. 
And a spirit passes before my face, || The hair of my flesh stands up; 
It stands, and I do not discern its aspect, || A likeness is before my eyes, || Silence! And I hear a voice: 
Is mortal man more righteous than God? Is a man cleaner than his Maker? 
Behold, He puts no credence in His servants, || Nor sets praise in His messengers. 
Also—the inhabitants of houses of clay || (Whose foundation is in the dust, || They bruise them before a moth). 
From morning to evening are beaten down, || Without any regarding, they perish forever. 
Has their excellence not been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!”
