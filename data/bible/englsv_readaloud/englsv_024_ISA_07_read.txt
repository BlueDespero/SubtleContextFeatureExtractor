Isaiah.
Chapter 7.
And it comes to pass in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, have gone up to Jerusalem, to battle against it, and he is not able to fight against it. 
And it is declared to the house of David, saying, “Aram has been led toward Ephraim,” and his heart and the heart of his people is moved, like the moving of trees of a forest by the presence of wind. 
And YHWH says to Isaiah, “Now go forth to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to the end of the conduit of the upper pool, to the highway of the fuller’s field, 
and you have said to him: Take heed, and be quiet, do not fear, || And do not let your heart be timid, || Because of these two tails of smoking brands, || For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin and Aram, || And the son of Remaliah. 
Because that Aram counseled evil against you, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying, 
We go up into Judah, and we distress it, || And we divide it to ourselves, || And we cause a king to reign in its midst—The son of Tabeal. 
Thus said Lord YHWH: It does not stand, nor will it be! 
For the head of Aram is Damascus, || And the head of Damascus is Rezin, || And within sixty-five years || Is Ephraim broken from being a people. 
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, || And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not give credence, || Surely you are not steadfast.” 
And YHWH adds to speak to Ahaz, saying, 
“Ask for a sign from your God YHWH, || Make the request deep, or make it high upwards.” 
And Ahaz says, “I do not ask nor try YHWH.” 
And he says, “Now hear, O house of David, || Is it a little thing for you to weary men, || That you also weary my God? 
Therefore the Lord Himself gives a sign to you, || Behold, the virgin is conceiving, || And is bringing forth a Son, || And has called His Name Immanuel, 
He eats butter and honey, || When He knows to refuse evil, and to fix on good. 
For before the youth knows || To refuse evil, and to fix on good, || The land you are distressed with is forsaken, because of her two kings. 
YHWH brings on you, and on your people, || And on the house of your father, || Days that have not come, || Even from the day of the turning aside of Ephraim from Judah, || By the king of Asshur.” 
And it has come to pass in that day, || YHWH hisses for a fly that is in the extremity of the brooks of Egypt, || And for a bee that is in the land of Asshur. 
And they have come, and all of them rested in the desolate valleys, || And in holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, || And on all the commendable things. 
In that day the Lord shaves, || By a razor that is hired beyond the river, || By the king of Asshur, || The head, and the hair of the feet, || Indeed, it also consumes the beard. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || A man keeps alive a heifer of the herd, || And two of the flock, 
And it has come to pass, || He eats butter from the abundance of the yielding of milk, || For everyone who is left in the heart of the land eats butter and honey. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || Every place where there are one thousand vines, || At one thousand pieces of silver, || Is for briers and for thorns. 
He comes there with arrows and with bow, || Because all the land is brier and thorn. 
And all the hills that are kept in order with a mattock, || There does not come for fear of brier and thorn, || And it has been for the sending forth of ox, || And for the treading of sheep!
