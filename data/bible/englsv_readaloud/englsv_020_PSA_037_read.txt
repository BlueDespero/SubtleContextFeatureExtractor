Psalms.
Chapter 37.
BY DAVID. ALEPH-BET Do not fret because of evildoers, || Do not be envious against doers of iniquity, 
For they are cut off speedily as grass, || And fade as the greenness of the tender grass. 
Trust in YHWH, and do good, || Dwell in the land, and enjoy faithfulness, 
And delight yourself on YHWH, || And He gives to you the petitions of your heart. 
Roll your way on YHWH, || And trust on Him, and He works, 
And has brought out your righteousness as light, || And your judgment as noon-day. 
Be silent for YHWH, and stay yourself for Him, || Do not fret because of him || Who is making his way prosperous, || Because of a man doing wicked schemes. 
Desist from anger, and forsake fury, || Do not fret yourself to only do evil. 
For evildoers are cut off, || As for those waiting on YHWH, they possess the land. 
And yet a little while, and the wicked is not, || And you have considered his place, and it is not. 
And the humble possess the land, || And they have delighted themselves || In the abundance of peace. 
The wicked is devising against the righteous, || And gnashing his teeth against him. 
The Lord laughs at him, || For He has seen that his day comes. 
The wicked have opened a sword, || And they have bent their bow, || To cause the poor and needy to fall, || To slaughter the upright of the way. 
Their sword enters into their own heart, || And their bows are shattered. 
Better is the little of the righteous, || Than the store of many wicked. 
For the arms of the wicked are shattered, || And YHWH is sustaining the righteous. 
YHWH knows the days of the perfect, || And their inheritance is for all time. 
They are not ashamed in a time of evil, || And they are satisfied in days of famine. 
But the wicked perish, and the enemies of YHWH, || Have been consumed as the preciousness of lambs, || They have been consumed in smoke. 
The wicked is borrowing and does not repay, || And the righteous is gracious and giving. 
For His blessed ones possess the land, || And His reviled ones are cut off. 
The steps of a man are from YHWH, || They have been prepared, || And He desires his way. 
When he falls, he is not cast down, || For YHWH is sustaining his hand. 
I have been young, || I have also become old, || And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, || And his seed seeking bread. 
All the day he is gracious and lending, || And his seed is for a blessing. 
Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell for all time. 
For YHWH is loving judgment, || And He does not forsake His saintly ones, || They have been kept for all time, || And the seed of the wicked is cut off. 
The righteous possess the land, || And they dwell on it forever. 
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, || And his tongue speaks judgment. 
The law of his God is his heart, || His steps do not slide. 
The wicked is watching for the righteous, || And is seeking to put him to death. 
YHWH does not leave him in his hand, || Nor condemn him in his being judged. 
Look to YHWH, and keep His way, || And He exalts you to possess the land, || In the wicked being cut off—you see! 
I have seen the wicked terrible, || And spreading as a green native plant, 
And he passes away, and behold, he is not, || And I seek him, and he is not found! 
Observe the perfect, and see the upright, || For the latter end of each is peace. 
And transgressors were destroyed together, || The latter end of the wicked was cut off. 
And the salvation of the righteous is from YHWH, || Their strong place in a time of adversity. 
And YHWH helps them and delivers them, || He delivers them from the wicked, || And saves them, || Because they trusted in Him!
