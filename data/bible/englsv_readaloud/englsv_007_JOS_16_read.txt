Joshua.
Chapter 16.
And the lot for the sons of Joseph goes out from Jordan by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness going up from Jericho in the hill-country of Beth-El, 
and has gone out from Beth-El to Luz, and passed over to the border of Archi to Ataroth, 
and gone down westward to the border of Japhleti, to the border of the lower Beth-Horon, and to Gezer, and its outgoings have been at the sea. 
And the sons of Joseph—Manasseh and Ephraim—inherit. 
And the border of the sons of Ephraim is by their families; and the border of their inheritance is on the east, Atroth-Addar to the upper Beth-Horon; 
and the border has gone out at the sea, to Michmethah on the north, and the border has gone around eastward to Taanath-Shiloh, and passed over it eastward to Janohah, 
and gone down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and touched against Jericho, and gone out at the Jordan. 
From Tappuah the border goes westward to the Brook of Kanah, and its outgoings have been at the sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, for their families. 
And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim are in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages; 
and they have not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwells in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and is for forced labor—serving.
