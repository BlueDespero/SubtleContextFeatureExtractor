Revelation.
Chapter 4.
After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in the sky, and the first voice that I heard—as of a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you what must come to pass after these things”; 
and immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and on the throne is One sitting, 
and He who is sitting was in appearance like a stone, jasper and sardine: and a rainbow was around the throne in appearance like an emerald. 
And around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and sitting on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders, having been clothed in white garments, and on their heads golden garlands; 
and out of the throne proceed lightnings, and thunders, and voices; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the Seven Spirits of God, 
and before the throne—a sea of glass like to crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and around the throne—four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind; 
and the first living creature—like a lion; and the second living creature—like a calf; and the third living creature has the face as a man; and the fourth living creature—like an eagle flying. 
And the four living creatures, one by one of them had six wings respectively, around and within are full of eyes, and they have no rest day and night, saying, “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, the LORD God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming”; 
and when the living creatures give glory, and honor, and thanksgiving, to the One sitting on the throne, the One living through the ages of the ages, 
the twenty-four elders will fall down before the One sitting on the throne, and worship the One living through the ages of the ages, and they will cast their garlands before the throne, saying, 
“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power, because You created all things, and because of Your will they existed and were created.”
