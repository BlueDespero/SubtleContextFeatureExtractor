Job.
Chapter 18.
And Bildad the Shuhite answers and says: 
“When do you set an end to words? Consider, and afterward we speak. 
Why have we been reckoned as livestock? We have been defiled in your eyes! 
He is tearing himself in his anger. Is earth forsaken for your sake? And is a rock removed from its place? 
Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there does not shine a spark of his fire. 
The light has been dark in his tent, || And his lamp over him is extinguished. 
The steps of his strength are restricted, || And his own counsel casts him down. 
For he is sent into a net by his own feet, || And he habitually walks on a snare. 
A trap seizes on the heel, || The designing prevails over him. 
His cord is hidden in the earth, || And his trap on the path. 
Terrors have terrified him all around, || And they have scattered him—at his feet. 
His sorrow is hungry, || And calamity is ready at his side. 
It consumes the parts of his skin, || Death’s firstborn consumes his parts. 
His confidence is drawn from his tent, || And it causes him to step to the king of terrors. 
It dwells in his tent—out of his provender, || Sulfur is scattered over his habitation. 
From beneath his roots are dried up, || And from above his crop is cut off. 
His memorial has perished from the land, || And he has no name on the street. 
They thrust him from light to darkness, || And cast him out from the habitable earth. 
He has no continuator, || Nor successor among his people, || And none is remaining in his dwellings. 
At this day, those in the west have been astonished, || And those in the east have taken fright. 
Only these are dwelling places of the perverse, || And this is the place God has not known.”
