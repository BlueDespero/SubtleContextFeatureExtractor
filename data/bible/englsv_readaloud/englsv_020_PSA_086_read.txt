Psalms.
Chapter 86.
A PRAYER OF DAVID. Incline, O YHWH, Your ear, || Answer me, for I am poor and needy. 
Keep my soul, for I am pious, || Save Your servant who is trusting to You, O You, my God. 
Favor me, O Lord, for I call to You all the day. 
Make glad the soul of Your servant, || For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul. 
For You, Lord, are good and forgiving, || And abundant in kindness to all calling You. 
Hear, O YHWH, my prayer, || And attend to the voice of my supplications. 
In a day of my distress I call You, || For You answer me. 
There is none like You among the gods, O Lord, || And like Your works there are none. 
All nations that You have made || Come and bow themselves before You, O Lord, || And give honor to Your Name. 
For You are great, and doing wonders, || You are God alone. 
Show me, O YHWH, Your way, || I walk in Your truth, || My heart rejoices to fear Your Name. 
I confess You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, || And I honor Your Name for all time. 
For Your kindness is great toward me, || And You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol. 
O God, the proud have risen up against me, || And a company of the terrible sought my soul, || And have not placed You before them, 
And You, O Lord, are God, merciful and gracious, || Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth. 
Look to me, and favor me, || Give Your strength to Your servant, || And give salvation to a son of Your handmaid. 
Do with me a sign for good, || And those hating me see and are ashamed, || For You, O YHWH, have helped me, || Indeed, You have comforted me!
