Isaiah.
Chapter 20.
In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Asshur sends him, and he fights against Ashdod and captures it, 
at that time YHWH spoke by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and you have loosed the sackcloth from off your loins, and you draw your sandal from off your foot,” and he does so, going naked and barefoot. 
And YHWH says, “As My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for Cush, 
so the king of Asshur leads the captivity of Egypt, and the expulsion of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with seat uncovered—the nakedness of Egypt; 
and they have been frightened and ashamed of Cush their confidence, and of Egypt their beauty, 
and the inhabitant of this island has said in that day—Behold, thus is our trust, || To where we have fled for help, || To be delivered from the king of Asshur, || And how do we escape—we?”
