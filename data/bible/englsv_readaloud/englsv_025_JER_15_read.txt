Jeremiah.
Chapter 15.
And YHWH says to me: “Though Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, || My soul is not toward this people, || Send from before My face, and they go out. 
And it has come to pass, when they say to you, || To where do we go out? That you have said to them, || Thus said YHWH: Those who are for death—to death, || And those who are for the sword—to the sword, || And those who are for famine—to famine, || And those who are for captivity—to captivity. 
And I have appointed four kinds over them,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “The sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, || And the bird of the heavens, || And the beast of the earth, to consume and to devour. 
And I have given them for a trembling || To all kingdoms of the earth, || Because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah, || For that which he did in Jerusalem. 
For who has pity on you, O Jerusalem? And who bemoans for you? And who turns aside to ask of your welfare? 
You have left Me,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “You go backward, || And I stretch out My hand against you, || And I destroy you, || I have been weary of relenting, 
And I scatter them with a fan, || In the gates of the land, || I have bereaved them, || I have destroyed My people, || They did not turn back from their ways. 
Its widows have been more to Me than the sand of the seas, || I brought on them—against the mother—A young man—a spoiler—at noon. I caused wrath and trouble to fall on her suddenly. 
The bearer of seven has languished, || She has breathed out her spirit, || Her sun has gone in while yet day, || It has been ashamed and confounded, || And I give up their remnant to the sword before their enemies,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
Woe to me, my mother, || For you have borne me, || A man of strife and a man of contention to all the land, || I have not lent on usury, || Nor have they lent on usury to me—All of them are reviling me. 
YHWH said, “Did I not direct you for good? Did I not intercede for you in a time of evil, || And in a time of adversity, with the enemy? 
Does one break iron, || Northern iron and bronze? 
I give your strength and your treasures for a prey—not for price, || Even for all your sins, and in all your borders. 
And I have caused your enemies || To pass over into the land that You have not known, || For a fire has been kindled in My anger, || It burns against you.” 
You, You have known, O YHWH, || Remember me, and inspect me, || And take vengeance for me of my pursuers, || In Your long-suffering do not take me away, || Know that I have borne reproach for You. 
Your words have been found, and I eat them, || And Your word is to me for a joy, || And for the rejoicing of my heart, || For Your Name is called on me, O YHWH, God of Hosts. 
I have not sat in an assembly of deriders, || Nor do I exult, because of your hand—I have sat alone, || For You have filled me with indignation. 
Why has my pain been continuous? And my wound incurable? It has refused to be healed, || You are surely as a failing stream to me, || Waters that are not steadfast. 
Therefore, thus said YHWH: “If you turn back, then I bring you back, || You stand before Me, || And if you bring out the precious from the vile, || You are as My mouth! They return to you, || And you do not return to them. 
And I have made you to this people || For a wall—bronze—fortified, || And they have fought against you, || And they do not prevail against you, || For I am with you to save you, || And to deliver you,” || A declaration of YHWH, 
“And I have delivered you from the hand of evildoers, || And I have ransomed you || From the hand of the terrible!”
