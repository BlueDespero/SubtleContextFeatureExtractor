Proverbs.
Chapter 15.
A soft answer turns back fury, || And a grievous word raises up anger. 
The tongue of the wise makes knowledge good, || And the mouth of fools utters folly. 
The eyes of YHWH are in every place, || Watching the evil and the good. 
A healed tongue is a tree of life, || And perverseness in it—a breach in the spirit. 
A fool despises the instruction of his father, || And whoever is regarding reproof is prudent. 
Abundant strength is in the house of the righteous, || And in the increase of the wicked—trouble. 
The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, || And the heart of fools is not right. 
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to YHWH, || And the prayer of the upright is His delight. 
The way of the wicked is an abomination to YHWH, || And He loves whoever is pursuing righteousness. 
Discipline is grievous to him who is forsaking the path, || Whoever is hating reproof dies. 
Sheol and destruction are before YHWH, || Surely also the hearts of the sons of men. 
A scorner does not love his reprover, || He does not go to the wise. 
A joyful heart makes the face glad, || And the spirit is struck by grief of heart. 
The heart of the intelligent seeks knowledge, || And the mouth of fools enjoys folly. 
All the days of the afflicted are evil, || And gladness of heart is a perpetual banquet. 
Better is a little with the fear of YHWH, || Than much treasure, and tumult with it. 
Better is an allowance of green herbs and love there, || Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it. 
A man of fury stirs up contention, || And the slow to anger appeases strife. 
The way of the slothful is as a hedge of briers, || And the path of the upright is raised up. 
A wise son makes a father glad. And a foolish man is despising his mother. 
Folly is joy to one lacking heart, || And a man of intelligence directs his going. 
The making void of purposes is without counsel, || And in a multitude of counselors it is established. 
Joy is to a man in the answer of his mouth, || And a word in its season—how good! 
A path of life is on high for the wise, || To turn aside from Sheol beneath. 
YHWH pulls down the house of the proud, || And He sets up the border of the widow. 
Thoughts of wickedness are an abomination to YHWH, || And sayings of pleasantness are pure. 
A dishonest gainer is troubling his house, || And whoever is hating gifts lives. 
The heart of the righteous meditates to answer, || And the mouth of the wicked utters evil things. 
YHWH is far from the wicked, || And He hears the prayer of the righteous. 
The light of the eyes makes the heart glad, || A good report makes the bone fat. 
An ear that is hearing the reproof of life || Lodges among the wise. 
Whoever is refusing instruction is despising his soul, || And whoever is hearing reproof || Is getting understanding. 
The fear of YHWH is the instruction of wisdom, || And humility is before honor!
