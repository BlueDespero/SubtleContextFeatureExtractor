Job.
Chapter 15.
And Eliphaz the Temanite answers and says: 
“Does a wise man answer with vain knowledge? And fill his belly with an east wind? 
To reason with a word not useful? And speeches—no profit in them? 
Indeed, you make reverence void, and diminish meditation before God. 
For your mouth teaches your iniquity, || And you choose the tongue of the cunning. 
Your mouth declares you wicked, and not I, || And your lips testify against you. 
Are you the first man born? And were you formed before the heights? 
Do you hear of the secret counsel of God? And withdraw wisdom to you? 
What have you known, and we do not know? What do you understand, and it is not with us? 
Both the gray-headed || And the very aged are among us—Greater than your father in days. 
Are the comforts of God too few for you? And a gentle word is with you, 
Why does your heart take you away? And why are your eyes high? 
Do you turn your spirit against God? And have brought out words from your mouth: 
What is man that he is pure, || And that he is righteous, one born of woman? 
Behold, He puts no credence in His holy ones, || And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes. 
Also—surely abominable and filthy || Is man drinking perverseness as water. 
I show you—listen to me—And this I have seen and declare, 
Which the wise declare—And have not hid—from their fathers. 
To them alone was the land given, || And a stranger did not pass over into their midst: 
All the days of the wicked he is paining himself, || And few years have been laid up for the terrible one. 
A fearful voice is in his ears, || In peace a destroyer comes to him. 
He does not believe to return from darkness, || And he watches for the sword. 
He is wandering for bread: Where is it? He has known that ready at his hand || Is a day of darkness. 
Adversity and distress terrify him, || They prevail over him as a king ready for a boaster. 
For he stretched out his hand against God, || And against the Mighty he makes himself mighty. 
He runs to Him with a neck, || With thick bosses of his shields. 
For he has covered his face with his fat, || And makes vigor over his confidence. 
And he inhabits cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, || That have been ready to become heaps. 
He is not rich, nor does his wealth rise, || Nor does he stretch out their continuance on earth. 
He does not turn aside from darkness, || A flame dries up his tender branch, || And he turns aside at the breath of His mouth! 
Do not let him put credence in vanity, || He has been deceived, || For vanity is his exchange. 
It is not completed in his day, || And his bending branch is not green. 
He shakes off his unripe fruit as a vine, || And casts off his blossom as an olive. 
For the company of the profane is barren, || And fire has consumed tents of bribery. 
To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, || Even their heart prepares deceit.”
