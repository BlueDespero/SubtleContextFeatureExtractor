Proverbs.
Chapter 9.
Wisdom has built her house, || She has hewn out her pillars—seven. 
She has slaughtered her slaughter, || She has mingled her wine, || Indeed, she has arranged her table. 
She has sent forth her girls, || She cries on the tops of the high places of the city: 
“Who is simple? Let him turn aside here.” Whoever lacks heart: she has said to him, 
“Come, eat of my bread, || And drink of the wine I have mingled. 
Forsake the simple and live, || And be blessed in the way of understanding.” 
The instructor of a scorner || Is receiving for it—shame, || And a reprover of the wicked—his blemish. 
Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you, || Give reproof to the wise, and he loves you. 
Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, || Make known to the righteous, || And he increases learning. 
The commencement of wisdom is the fear of YHWH, || And a knowledge of the Holy Ones is understanding. 
For by me your days multiply, || And years of life are added to you. 
If you have been wise, you have been wise for yourself, || And you have scorned—you bear it alone. 
A foolish woman is noisy, || Simple, and has not known what. 
And she has sat at the opening of her house, || On a throne—the high places of the city, 
To call to those passing by the way, || Who are going straight on their paths. 
“Who is simple? Let him turn aside here.” And whoever lacks heart—she said to him, 
“Stolen waters are sweet, || And hidden bread is pleasant.” 
And he has not known that Rephaim are there, || Her invited ones in deep places of Sheol!
