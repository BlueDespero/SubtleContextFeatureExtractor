Acts.
Chapter 6.
And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministry, 
and the Twelve, having called near the multitude of the disciples, said, “It is not pleasing that we, having left the word of God, minister at tables; 
look out, therefore, brothers, seven men of you who are testified well of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this necessity, 
and we to prayer, and to the ministry of the word, will give ourselves continually.” 
And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch, 
whom they set before the apostles, and they, having prayed, laid their hands on them. 
And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude of the priests were also obedient to the faith. 
And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people, 
and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, the one called Libertines (and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia), disputing with Stephen, 
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking; 
then they suborned men, saying, “We have heard him speaking slanderous sayings in regard to Moses and God.” 
They also stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come on him, they caught him, and brought him to the Sanhedrin; 
they also set up false witnesses, saying, “This one does not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the Law, 
for we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarean will overthrow this place, and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us”; 
and gazing at him, all those sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face as it were the face of a messenger.
