Psalms.
Chapter 85.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. You have accepted, O YHWH, Your land, || You have turned to the captivity of Jacob. 
You have carried away the iniquity of Your people, || You have covered all their sin. Selah. 
You have gathered up all Your wrath, || You have turned back from the fierceness of Your anger. 
Turn back to us, O God of our salvation, || And make void Your anger with us. 
Are You angry against us for all time? Do You draw out Your anger || To generation and generation? 
Do You not turn back? You revive us, || And Your people rejoice in You. 
Show us, O YHWH, your kindness, || And You give to us Your salvation. 
I hear what God, YHWH, speaks, || For He speaks peace to His people, || And to His saints, and they do not turn back to folly. 
Surely His salvation is near to those fearing Him, || That glory may dwell in our land. 
Kindness and truth have met, || Righteousness and peace have kissed, 
Truth springs up from the earth, || And righteousness looks out from the heavens, 
YHWH also gives that which is good, || And our land gives its increase. 
Righteousness goes before Him, || And makes a way for His footsteps!
