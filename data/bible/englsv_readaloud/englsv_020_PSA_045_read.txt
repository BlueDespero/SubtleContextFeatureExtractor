Psalms.
Chapter 45.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “LILIES.” AN INSTRUCTION OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A SONG OF LOVES. My heart has stirred a good word, || I am telling my works to the King, || My tongue is the pen of a speedy writer. 
You have been beautified above the sons of men, || Grace has been poured into Your lips, || Therefore God has blessed You for all time. 
Gird Your sword on the thigh, O Mighty One, || Your splendor and Your majesty! 
As for Your majesty—prosper and ride! Because of truth, meekness, and righteousness, || And Your right hand shows You fearful things. 
Your arrows are sharp—Peoples fall under You—In the heart of the enemies of the King. 
Your throne, O God, is for all time and forever, || A scepter of uprightness || Is the scepter of Your kingdom. 
You have loved righteousness and hate wickedness, || Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You || With oil of joy above Your companions. 
Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia || Cover all Your garments; Out of palaces of ivory, || Stringed instruments have made You glad. 
Daughters of kings are among Your precious ones, || A queen has stood at Your right hand, || In pure gold of Ophir. 
Listen, O daughter, and see, incline your ear, || And forget your people, and your father’s house, 
And the King desires your beauty, || Because He is your Lord—bow yourself to Him, 
And the daughter of Tyre with a present, || The rich of the people appease your face. 
All glory is the daughter of the king within, || Her clothing is with filigrees of gold. 
In various colors she is brought to the King; Afterward, virgins, her companions, || Are brought to You. 
They are brought with joy and gladness, || They come into the palace of the King. 
Instead of Your fathers are Your sons, || You appoint them for princes in all the earth. 
I make mention of Your Name in all generations, || Therefore peoples praise You, || For all time and forever!
