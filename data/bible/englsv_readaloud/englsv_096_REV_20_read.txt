Revelation.
Chapter 20.
And I saw a messenger coming down out of Heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand, 
and he laid hold on the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him one thousand years, 
and he cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and put a seal on him, that he may no longer lead the nations astray, until the one thousand years may be completed; and after these it is necessary for him to be loosed a short time. 
And I saw thrones, and they that sat on them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not worship the beast, nor his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand, and they lived and reigned with the Christ one thousand years; 
and the rest of the dead did not live again until the one thousand years may be completed; this is the first resurrection. 
Blessed and holy—he who is having part in the first resurrection; the second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will reign with Him one thousand years. 
And when the one thousand years may be completed, Satan will be loosed out of his prison, 
and he will go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—to gather them together to war, of whom the number—as the sand of the sea; 
and they went up over the breadth of the land, and surrounded the camp of the holy ones, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of Heaven, and devoured them; 
and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night through the ages of the ages. 
And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them; 
and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls—according to their works; 
and the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works; 
and death and Hades were cast into the lake of the fire—this is the second death; 
and if anyone was not found written in the Scroll of Life, he was cast into the lake of the fire.
