Job.
Chapter 23.
And Job answers and says: 
“Also—today my complaint is bitter, || My hand has been heavy because of my sighing. 
O that I had known—and I find Him, || I come to His seat, 
I arrange the cause before Him, || And fill my mouth with arguments. 
I know the words He answers me, || And understand what He says to me. 
Does He strive with me in the abundance of power? No! Surely He puts it in me. 
There the upright reason with Him, || And I escape from mine who is judging—forever. 
Behold, I go forward—and He is not, || And backward—and I do not perceive Him. 
To the left in His working—and I do not see, || He is covered on the right, and I do not behold. 
For He has known the way with me, || He has tried me—I go forth as gold. 
My foot has laid hold on His step, || I have kept His way, and do not turn aside, 
The command of His lips, and I do not depart. I have laid up above my allotted portion || The sayings of His mouth. 
And He is in one mind, || And who turns Him back? And His soul has desired—and He does it. 
For He completes my portion, || And many such things are with Him. 
Therefore, I am troubled at His presence, I consider, and am afraid of Him. 
And God has made my heart soft, || And the Mighty has troubled me. 
For I have not been cut off before darkness, || And before me He covered thick darkness.”
