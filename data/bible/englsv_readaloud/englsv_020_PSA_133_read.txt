Psalms.
Chapter 133.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. Behold, how good and how pleasant || The dwelling of brothers—even together! 
As the good oil on the head, || Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, || That comes down on the skirt of his robes, 
As dew of Hermon—That comes down on hills of Zion, || For there YHWH commanded the blessing—Life for all time!
