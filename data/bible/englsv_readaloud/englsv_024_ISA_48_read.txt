Isaiah.
Chapter 48.
“Hear this, O house of Jacob, || Who are called by the name of Israel, || And from the waters of Judah came out, || Who are swearing by the Name of YHWH, || And make mention of the God of Israel, || Not in truth nor in righteousness. 
For they have been called from the Holy City, || And been supported on the God of Israel, || YHWH of Hosts is His Name. 
I declared the former things from that time, || And they have gone forth from My mouth, || And I proclaim them, || Suddenly I have done, and it comes. 
From My knowing that you are obstinate, || And your neck—a sinew of iron, || And your forehead—bronze, 
And from that time I declare it to you, || Before it comes I have caused you to hear, || Lest you say, My idol has done them, || And my carved image, || And my molten image commanded them. 
You have heard, see the whole of it, || And you, do you not declare? I have caused you to hear new things from this time, || And things reserved that you did not know. 
Now they have been produced and not from that time, || Indeed, before the day, and you have not heard them, || Lest you say, Behold, I have known them. 
Indeed, you have not heard, || Indeed, you have not known, || Indeed, your ear has not opened from that time, || For I have known you deal treacherously, || And are a transgressor from the belly, || One is crying to you. 
I defer My anger for My Name’s sake, || And for My praise I restrain for you, || So as not to cut you off. 
Behold, I have refined you, and not with silver, || I have chosen you in a furnace of affliction. 
For My sake, for My own sake, I do it, || For how is it defiled? And I do not give My glory to another. 
Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called one, || I am He, || I am first, and I am last; 
Also, My hand has founded earth, || And My right hand stretched out the heavens, || I am calling to them, they stand together. 
Be gathered, all of you, and hear, || Who among them declared these things? YHWH has loved him, || He does His pleasure on Babylon, || And His arm is on the Chaldeans. 
I have spoken, indeed, I have called him, I have brought him in, || And he has made his way prosperous. 
Come near to Me, hear this, || I have not spoken in secret from the beginning, || From the time of its being, I am there, || And now Lord YHWH has sent Me, and His Spirit.” 
Thus said YHWH, your Redeemer, || The Holy One of Israel: “I am your God YHWH, teaching you to profit, || Causing you to tread in the way you go. 
O that you had attended to My commands, || Then your peace is as a river, || And your righteousness as billows of the sea, 
And your seed is as sand, || And the offspring of your bowels as gravel, || His name would not be cut off nor destroyed before Me.” 
Go out from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, || Declare with a voice of singing, || Cause this to be heard, || Bring it forth to the end of the earth, || Say, “YHWH has redeemed His servant Jacob.” 
And they have not thirsted in wastelands, || He has caused them to go on, || He has caused waters from a rock to flow to them, || Indeed, he cleaves a rock, and waters flow. 
“There is no peace,” said YHWH, “for the wicked!”
