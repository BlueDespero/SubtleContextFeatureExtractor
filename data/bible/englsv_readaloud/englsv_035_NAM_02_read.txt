Nahum.
Chapter 2.
A scatterer has come up to your face, || Keep the bulwark, watch the way, || Strengthen the loins, strengthen power mightily. 
For YHWH has turned back to the excellence of Jacob, || As to the excellence of Israel, || For emptiers have emptied them out, || And they have marred their branches. 
The shield of his mighty ones has become red, || Men of might are in scarlet, || With fiery torches is the chariot in a day of his preparation, || And the firs have been caused to tremble. 
In out-places the chariots shine, || They go to and fro in broad places, || Their appearances are like torches, || As lightnings they run. 
He remembers his majestic ones, || They stumble in their goings, || They hurry to its wall, || And the covering is prepared. 
Gates of the rivers have been opened, || And the palace is dissolved. 
And it is established—she has removed, || She has been brought up, || And her handmaids are leading as the voice of doves, || Tabering on their hearts. 
And Nineveh is as a pool of waters, || From of old it is—and they are fleeing! “Stand, stand”; and none is turning! 
Seize silver, seize gold, || And there is no end to the prepared things, || To the abundance of all desirable vessels. 
She is empty, indeed, emptiness and waste, || And the heart has melted, || And the knees have struck together, || And great pain is in all loins, || And the faces of all of them have gathered paleness. 
Where is the habitation of lionesses? And a feeding-place it is for young lions || Where a lion has walked, an old lion, || A lion’s whelp, and there is none troubling. 
The lion is tearing parts for his whelps, || And is strangling for his lionesses, || And he fills his holes with prey, || And his habitations with torn flesh. 
“Behold, I am against you,” || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || “And I have burned its chariot in smoke, || And a sword consumes your young lions, || And I have cut off your prey from the land, || And the voice of your messengers is not heard anymore!”
