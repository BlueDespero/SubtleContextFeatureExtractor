Psalms.
Chapter 71.
In You, O YHWH, I have trusted, || Do not let me be disappointed for all time. 
You deliver me in Your righteousness, || And cause me to escape, || Incline Your ear to me, and save me. 
Be a rock to me—a habitation, || To go in continually, || You have given command to save me, || For You are my rock and my bulwark. 
O my God, cause me to escape || From the hand of the wicked, || From the hand of the perverse and violent. 
For You are my hope, O Lord YHWH, || My trust from my youth. 
I have been supported from the womb by You, || You cut me out from my mother’s bowels, || My praise is continually in You. 
I have been as a wonder to many, || And You are my strong refuge. 
My mouth is filled with Your praise, || All the day with Your beauty. 
Do not cast me off at the time of old age, || Do not forsake me according to the consumption of my power. 
For my enemies have spoken against me, || And those watching my soul have taken counsel together, 
Saying, “God has forsaken him, || Pursue and catch him, for there is no deliverer.” 
O God, do not be far from me, || O my God, make haste for my help. 
They are ashamed, they are consumed, || Who are opposing my soul, || They are covered with reproach and blushing, || Who are seeking my evil, 
And I continually wait with hope, || And have added to all Your praise. 
My mouth recounts Your righteousness, || All the day Your salvation, || For I have not known the numbers. 
I come in the might of Lord YHWH, || I mention Your righteousness—Yours alone. 
God, You have taught me from my youth, || And until now I declare Your wonders. 
And also to old age and grey hairs, || O God, do not forsake me, || Until I declare Your strength to a generation, || Your might to everyone that comes. 
And Your righteousness, O God, is to the heights, || Because You have done great things, || O God, who is like You? 
Because You have showed me many and sad distresses, || You turn back—You revive me, || And from the depths of the earth, || You turn back—You bring me up. 
You increase my greatness, || And You surround—You comfort me, 
I also thank You with a vessel of stringed instrument, || Your truth, O my God, I sing to You with a harp, || O Holy One of Israel, 
My lips cry aloud when I sing praise to You, || And my soul that You have redeemed, 
My tongue also utters Your righteousness all the day, || Because ashamed—because confounded, || Have been those seeking my evil!
