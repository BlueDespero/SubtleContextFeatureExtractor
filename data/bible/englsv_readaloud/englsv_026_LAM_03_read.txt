Lamentations.
Chapter 3.
ALEPH-BET I am the man who has seen affliction || By the rod of His wrath. 
He has led me, and causes to go in darkness, and without light. 
Surely against me He turns back, || He turns His hand all the day. 
He has worn out my flesh and my skin. He has broken my bones. 
He has built up against me, || And sets around poverty and weariness. 
In dark places He has caused me to dwell, || As the dead of old. 
He has hedged me in, and I do not go out, || He has made heavy my chain. 
Also when I call and cry out, || He has shut out my prayer. 
He has hedged my ways with hewn work, || My paths He has made crooked. 
A bear lying in wait He is to me, || A lion in secret hiding places. 
My ways He is turning aside, and He pulls me in pieces, || He has made me a desolation. 
He has bent His bow, || And sets me up as a mark for an arrow. 
He has caused to enter into my reins || The sons of His quiver. 
I have been a derision to all my people, || Their song all the day. 
He has filled me with bitter things, || He has filled me with wormwood. 
And He breaks with gravel my teeth, || He has covered me with ashes. 
And You cast off my soul from peace, || I have forgotten prosperity. 
And I say, My strength and my hope have perished from YHWH. 
Remember my affliction and my mourning, || Wormwood and gall! 
Remember well, and my soul bows down in me. 
This I turn to my heart—therefore I hope. 
The kindnesses of YHWH! For we have not been consumed, || For His mercies have not ended. 
New every morning, abundant is Your faithfulness. 
My portion is YHWH, my soul has said, || Therefore I hope for Him. 
YHWH is good to those waiting for Him, || To the soul that seeks Him. 
It is good when one stays and stands still || For the salvation of YHWH. 
It is good for a man that he bears a yoke in his youth. 
He sits alone, and is silent, || For He has laid it on him. 
He puts his mouth in the dust, if so be, there is hope. 
He gives to his striker the cheek, || He is filled with reproach. 
For the Lord does not cast off for all time. 
For though He afflicted, yet He has pitied, || According to the abundance of His kindness. 
For He has not afflicted with His heart, || Nor does He grieve the sons of men. 
To bruise under one’s feet any bound ones of earth, 
To turn aside the judgment of a man, || Before the face of the Most High, 
To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord has not approved. 
Who is this—he has spoken, and it is, || And the Lord has not commanded it? 
From the mouth of the Most High does not go forth the evils and the good. 
Why does a living man sigh habitually, || A man for his sin? 
We search our ways, and investigate, || And turn back to YHWH. 
We lift up our heart on the hands to God in the heavens. 
We have transgressed and been rebellious, || You have not forgiven. 
You have covered Yourself with anger, || And pursue us; You have slain—You have not pitied. 
You have covered Yourself with a cloud, || So that prayer does not pass through. 
Outcast and refuse You make us || In the midst of the peoples. 
Opened against us their mouth have all our enemies. 
Fear and a snare has been for us, || Desolation and destruction. 
Streams of water go down my eye, || For the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
My eye is poured out, || And does not cease without intermission, 
Until YHWH looks and sees from the heavens, 
My eye affects my soul, || Because of all the daughters of my city. 
Hunting—my enemies have hunted me without cause like the bird. 
They have cut off my life in a pit, || And they cast a stone against me. 
Waters have flowed over my head, I have said, I have been cut off. 
I called Your Name, O YHWH, from the lower pit. 
You have heard my voice, do not hide Your ear at my breathing—at my cry. 
You have drawn near in the day I call You, You have said, Do not fear. 
You have pleaded, O Lord, the pleadings of my soul, || You have redeemed my life. 
You have seen, O YHWH, my overthrow, || Judge my cause. 
You have seen all their vengeance, || All their thoughts of me. 
You have heard their reproach, O YHWH, || All their thoughts against me, 
The lips of my withstanders, || Even their meditation against me all the day. 
Their sitting down, and their rising up, || Behold attentively, I am their song. 
You return to them the deed, O YHWH, || According to the work of their hands. 
You give to them a covered heart, || Your curse to them. 
You pursue in anger, and destroy them, || From under the heavens of YHWH!
