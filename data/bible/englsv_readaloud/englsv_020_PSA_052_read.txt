Psalms.
Chapter 52.
TO THE OVERSEER. AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID, IN THE COMING IN OF DOEG THE EDOMITE, AND HE DECLARES TO SAUL AND SAYS TO HIM, “DAVID CAME TO THE HOUSE OF AHIMELECH.” Why do you boast in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God is all the day. 
Your tongue devises mischiefs, || Like a sharp razor, working deceit. 
You have loved evil rather than good, || Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah. 
You have loved all devouring words, || O you deceitful tongue. 
Also—God breaks you down forever, || Takes you, and pulls you out of the tent, || And He has uprooted you || Out of the land of the living. Selah. 
And the righteous see, || And fear, and laugh at him. 
“Behold, the man who does not make God his strong place, || And trusts in the abundance of his riches, || He is strong in his mischiefs.” 
And I, as a green olive in the house of God, || I have trusted in the kindness of God, || For all time and forever, 
I thank You for all time, because You have done it, || And I wait on Your Name for it is good before Your saints!
