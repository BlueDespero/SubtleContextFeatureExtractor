Deuteronomy.
Chapter 33.
And this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death, 
and he says: “YHWH has come from Sinai, || And has risen from Seir for them; He has shone from Mount Paran, || And has come with myriads of holy ones; At His right hand came a fiery law or a flaming fire for them. 
Indeed, He is loving the peoples; All His holy ones are in Your hand, || And they sat down at Your foot, || Each lifts up Your words. 
Moses has commanded a law for us, || A possession of the assembly of Jacob. 
And He is King in Yeshurun, || In the heads of the people gathering together, || The tribes of Israel! 
Let Reuben live, and not die, || And let his men be an incalculable number. 
And this is for Judah, and he says: Hear, O YHWH, the voice of Judah, || And You bring him in to his people; His hand has striven for him, || And You are a help from his adversaries. 
And of Levi he said: Your Perfections and your Lights are for your pious one, || Whom You have tried in Massah, || You strive with him at the waters of Meribah; 
Who is saying of his father and his mother, || I have not seen him; And he has not discerned his brothers, || And he has not known his sons; For they have observed Your saying, || And they keep Your covenant. 
They teach Your judgments to Jacob, || And Your law to Israel; They put incense in Your nose, || And whole burnt-offering on Your altar. 
Bless, O YHWH, his strength, || And accept the work of his hands, || Strike the loins of his withstanders, || And of those hating him—that they do not rise! 
Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of YHWH dwells confidently by Him, || Covering him over every day; Indeed, he dwells between His shoulders. 
And of Joseph he said: His land is blessed by YHWH, || By a precious thing of the heavens, || By dew, and by the deep crouching beneath, 
And by a precious thing—fruits of the sun, || And by a precious thing—cast forth by the months, 
And by a chief thing—of the ancient mountains, || And by a precious thing—of the continuous heights, 
And by a precious thing—of earth and its fullness, || And the good pleasure of Him who is dwelling in the bush; Let it come for the head of Joseph, || And for the crown of him who is separate from his brothers. 
His splendor is a firstling of his ox, || And his horns are horns of a wild ox; With them he pushes the peoples || Altogether to the ends of the earth; And they are the myriads of Ephraim, || And they are the thousands of Manasseh. 
And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, O Zebulun, in your going out, || And, O Issachar, in your tents; 
They call peoples to the mountain, || There they sacrifice righteous sacrifices; For they suck up the abundance of the seas, || And hidden things hidden in the sand. 
And of Gad he said: Blessed is he who is enlarging Gad, || He dwells as a lioness, || And has torn the arm—also the crown! 
And he provides the first part for himself, || For there the portion of the lawgiver is covered, || And he comes with the heads of the people; He has done the righteousness of YHWH, || And His judgments with Israel. 
And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion’s whelp; He leaps from Bashan. 
And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, || And full of the blessing of YHWH, || Possess the west and the south. 
And of Asher he said: Asher is blessed with sons, || Let him be accepted by his brothers, || And dipping his foot in oil. 
Iron and bronze are your shoes, || And as your days—your strength. 
There is none like the God of Yeshurun, || Riding the heavens to your help, || And in His excellence the skies. 
The eternal God is a habitation, || And beneath are continuous arms. And He casts out the enemy from your presence and says, Destroy! 
And Israel dwells in confidence alone; The eye of Jacob is to a land of grain and wine; Also His heavens drop down dew. 
O your blessedness, O Israel! Who is like you? A people saved by YHWH, || The shield of your help, || And He who is the sword of your excellence! And your enemies are subdued for you, || And you tread on their high places.”
