Jeremiah.
Chapter 2.
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Go, and you have called in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said YHWH: I have remembered for you || The kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, || Your going after Me in a wilderness, in a land not sown. 
Israel is holy to YHWH, || The first-fruit of His increase, || All consuming him are guilty, || Calamity comes to them,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
Hear a word of YHWH, O house of Jacob, || And all you families of the house of Israel— 
Thus said YHWH: “What perversity have your fathers found in Me, || That they have gone far off from Me, || And go after vanity, and become vain, 
And have not said, Where is YHWH, || Who brings us up out of the land of Egypt, || Who leads us in a wilderness, || In a land of deserts and pits, || In a dry land, and of death-shade, || In a land that none has passed through, || Nor has man dwelt there? 
Indeed, I bring you into a land of fruitful fields, || To eat its fruit and its goodness, || And you come in and defile My land, || And have made My inheritance an abomination. 
The priests have not said, Where is YHWH? And those handling the Law have not known Me. And the shepherds transgressed against Me, || And the prophets have prophesied by Ba‘al, || And have gone after those who do not profit. 
Therefore, I yet plead with you,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “And I plead with your sons’ sons. 
For pass to the islands of Chittim and see, || And send to Kedar and consider well, || And see if there has been anything like this: 
Has a nation changed gods? (And they are no gods!) And My people has changed its glory || For that which does not profit. 
Be astonished, you heavens, at this, || Indeed, be frightened, be greatly desolated,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“For My people have done two evils, || They have forsaken Me, a fountain of living waters, || To hew out for themselves wells—broken wells, || That do not contain the waters. 
Is Israel a servant? Is he a child of the house? Why has he been for a prey? 
Young lions roar against him, || They have given forth their voice, || And make his land become a desolation, || His cities have been burned without inhabitant. 
Also sons of Noph and Tahapanes || Consume you—the crown of the head! 
Do you not do this to yourself? By your forsaking your God YHWH, || At the time He is leading you in the way? 
And now, why do you go in the way of Egypt, || To drink the waters of Sihor? And why do you go in the way of Asshur, || To drink the waters of the River? 
Your wickedness instructs you, || And your backslidings reprove you, || Know and see that an evil and a bitter thing is your forsaking your God YHWH, || And My fear not being on you,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH of Hosts. 
“For from of old you have broken your yoke, || Drawn away your bands, and say, I do not serve, || For on every high height, and under every green tree, || You are wandering—a harlot. 
And I planted you as a choice vine, wholly of true seed, || And how have you been turned || Into the degenerate shoots of a strange vine to Me? 
But though you wash with natron, || And multiply soap to yourself, || Your iniquity is marked before Me,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
“How can you say, I have not been defiled, || I have not gone after the Ba‘alim? See your way in a valley, know what you have done, || A swift dromedary winding her ways, 
A wild donkey accustomed to a wilderness, || She has swallowed up wind in the desire of her soul, || Her meeting—who turns her back? None seeking her weary themselves, || In her month they find her. 
Withhold your foot from being unshod, || And your throat from thirst, || And you say, It is incurable, || No, for I have loved strangers, and I go after them. 
As the shame of a thief when he is found, || So has the house of Israel been put to shame, || They, their kings, their heads, || And their priests, and their prophets, 
Saying to wood, You are my father! And to a stone, You have brought me forth, || For they turned to me the back and not the face, || And in the time of their distress, || They say, Arise, and save us. 
And where are your gods, that you have made to yourself? Let them arise, if they may save you, || In the time of your distress, || For—the number of your cities have been your gods, O Judah, 
Why do you strive with Me? All of you have transgressed against Me,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“I have struck your sons in vain, || They have not accepted instruction, || Your sword has devoured your prophets, || As a destroying lion. 
O generation, see the word of YHWH: Have I been a wilderness to Israel? A land of thick darkness? Why have My people said, || We wandered freely, || We do not come to You again. 
Does a virgin forget her ornaments? A bride her bands? And My people have forgotten Me for days without number. 
Why do you make your ways pleasing to seek love? Therefore you have even taught the wicked your ways. 
Also the blood of innocent needy souls || Has been found on your skirts, || I have not found them by digging, || But on all these. 
And you say, Because I have been innocent, || Surely His anger has turned back from me? Behold, I have been judged with you, || Because of your saying, I have not sinned. 
What? You are very vile to repeat your way, || You are even ashamed of Egypt, || As you have been ashamed of Asshur, 
Also you go out from this, || And your hands on your head, || For YHWH has kicked at your confidences, || And you do not give prosperity to them!”
