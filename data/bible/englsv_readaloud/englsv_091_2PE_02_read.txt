2 Peter.
Chapter 2.
But there also came false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you, who will stealthily bring in destructive sects, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing quick destruction to themselves, 
and many will follow out their destructive ways, because of whom the way of the truth will be spoken of as evil, 
and in covetousness, with forged words, they will make merchandise of you, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. 
For if God did not spare messengers having sinned, but having cast them down to Tartarus with chains of deepest gloom, delivered them, having been reserved to judgment, 
and did not spare the old world, but kept the eighth person, Noah, a preacher of righteousness, having brought a flood on the world of the impious, 
and having turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, condemned with an overthrow, having set them as an example to those about to be impious, 
and He rescued righteous Lot, worn down by the conduct of the lawless in licentiousness, 
for the righteous man dwelling among them was tormented in his righteous soul, day by day, in seeing and hearing unlawful works— 
the LORD has known to rescue the pious out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous being punished to the day of judgment, 
and chiefly those following after the flesh in lust and defilement, and despising lordship. Bold, self-pleased, they are not afraid to speak evil of glorious ones, 
whereas messengers, being greater in strength and power, do not bear a slanderous judgment against them before the LORD; 
and these, as irrational natural beasts, made to be caught and destroyed—in what things they are ignorant of, slandering—in their destruction will be destroyed; 
doing unjustly, they will receive a reward of unrighteousness, esteeming pleasure in the day, and luxury—they are spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits, feasting with you, 
having eyes full of adultery, and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart exercised in covetousnesses, children of a curse, 
having forsaken a right way, they went astray, having followed in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved a reward of unrighteousness, 
and had a rebuke of his own iniquity—a mute donkey, having spoken in man’s voice, forbid the madness of the prophet. 
These are wells without water, and clouds driven by a storm, to whom the deepest gloom of darkness has been kept throughout the age; 
for speaking swollen words of vanity, they entice in desires of the flesh—licentiousness, those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error, 
promising liberty to them, themselves being servants of corruption, for by whom anyone has been overcome, he has been brought to servitude to this one also; 
for if having escaped from the defilements of the world, in the acknowledging of the LORD and Savior Jesus Christ, and again being entangled by these things, they have been overcome, the last things have become worse to them than the first, 
for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of righteousness, than having acknowledged it, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them, 
and that of the true proverb has happened to them: “A dog turned back on his own vomit,” and, “A sow having bathed herself—to rolling in mire.”
