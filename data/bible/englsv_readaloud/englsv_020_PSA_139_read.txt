Psalms.
Chapter 139.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, You have searched me, and know. 
You have known my sitting down, || And my rising up, || You have attended to my thoughts from afar. 
You have fanned my path and my lying down, || And have been acquainted with all my ways. 
For there is not a word in my tongue, || Behold, O YHWH, You have known it all! 
You have besieged me behind and before, || And You place Your hand on me. 
Knowledge too wonderful for me, || It has been set on high, || I am not able for it. 
To where do I go from Your Spirit? And to where do I flee from Your face? 
If I ascend the heavens—You are there, || And spread out a bed in Sheol, behold, You! 
I take the wings of morning, || I dwell in the uttermost part of the sea, 
Also there Your hand leads me, || And Your right hand holds me. 
And I say, “Surely darkness bruises me,” || Then night is light to me. 
Also darkness does not hide from You, || And night shines as day, || As is darkness so is light. 
For You have possessed my reins, || You cover me in my mother’s belly. 
I confess You, because I have been fearfully distinguished. Your works are wonderful, || And my soul is knowing it well. 
My substance was not hid from You, || When I was made in secret, || Curiously worked in the lower part of earth. 
Your eyes saw my unformed substance, || And all of them are written on Your scroll, || The days they were formed—And not one among them. 
And how precious Your thoughts have been to me, || O God, how great has been their sum! 
I recount them! They are more than the sand, || I have awoken, and I am still with You. 
Do You slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood, turn aside from me! 
Who exchange You for wickedness, || Your enemies are lifted up to vanity. 
Do I not hate, YHWH, those hating You? And grieve myself with Your withstanders? 
I have hated them with perfect hatred, || They have become enemies to me. 
Search me, O God, and know my heart, || Try me, and know my thoughts, 
And see if a grievous way be in me, || And lead me in a perpetual way!
