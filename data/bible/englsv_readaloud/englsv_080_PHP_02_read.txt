Philippians.
Chapter 2.
If, then, any exhortation is in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any yearnings and mercies, 
fulfill my joy, that you may mind the same thing—having the same love—of one soul—minding the one thing, 
nothing in rivalry or vainglory, but in humility of mind counting one another more excellent than yourselves— 
do not each look to your own, but each also to the things of others. 
For let this mind be in you that is also in Christ Jesus, 
who, being in the form of God, thought it not something to be seized to be equal to God, 
but emptied Himself, having taken the form of a servant, having been made in the likeness of men, 
and having been found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself, having become obedient to death—even death of a cross, 
for this reason, also, God highly exalted Him, and gave to Him a Name that is above every name, 
that in the Name of Jesus every knee may bow—of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth— 
and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is LORD, to the glory of God the Father. 
So that, my beloved, as you always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, 
for it is God who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure. 
Do all things without murmurings and deliberations, 
that you may become blameless and pure children of God, unblemished in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as luminaries in the world, 
holding forth the word of life, for rejoicing to me in regard to the Day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, nor did I labor in vain; 
but if I also am poured forth on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and am glad with you all, 
because of this you also rejoice and are glad with me. 
And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, to send Timotheus to you quickly, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you, 
for I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for the things concerning you, 
for the whole seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus, 
and you know his proof, that as a child serves a father, he served with me in regard to the good news; 
I indeed hope to send him, when I may see through the things concerning me—immediately; 
and I trust in the LORD that I will also come quickly myself. 
And I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus—my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need, 
seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because you heard that he ailed, 
for he also ailed near to death, but God dealt kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow. 
The more eagerly, therefore, I sent him, that having seen him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful; 
receive him, therefore, in the LORD, with all joy, and hold such in honor, 
because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded life that he might fill up your deficiency of service to me.
