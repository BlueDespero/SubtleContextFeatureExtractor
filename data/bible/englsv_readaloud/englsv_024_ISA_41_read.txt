Isaiah.
Chapter 41.
Keep silent toward Me, O islands, || And the peoples pass on to power, || They come near, then they speak, “Together we draw near to judgment.” 
Who stirred up a righteous one from the east? He calls him to His foot, || He gives nations before him, || And He causes him to rule kings, || He gives them as dust to his sword, || As driven stubble to his bow. 
He pursues them, he passes over in safety || A path he does not enter with his feet. 
Who has worked and done, || Calling the generations from the first? I, YHWH, the first, and with the last I am He. 
Islands have seen and fear, || The ends of the earth tremble, || They have drawn near, indeed, they come. 
They each help his neighbor, || And to his brother he says, “Be strong.” 
And an artisan strengthens the refiner, || A smoother with a hammer, || Him who is beating on an anvil, saying, “For joining it is good,” || And he strengthens it with nails, it is not moved! 
And you, O Israel, My servant, || Jacob, whom I have chosen, || Seed of Abraham, My lover, 
Whom I have taken hold of, from the ends of the earth, || And from its near places I have called you, || And I say to you, You are My servant, || I have chosen you, and not rejected you. 
Do not be afraid, for I am with you, do not look around, for I am your God, || I have strengthened you, || Indeed, I have helped you, indeed, I upheld you, || With the right hand of My righteousness. 
Behold, all those displeased with you, || They are ashamed and blush, || They are as nothing, indeed, || The men who strive with you perish. 
You seek them, and do not find them, || The men who debate with you, || They are as nothing, indeed, as nothing, || The men who war with you. 
For I, your God YHWH, || Am strengthening your right hand, || He who is saying to you, “Do not fear, I have helped you.” 
Do not fear, O worm Jacob, || You men of Israel, || I helped you, a declaration of YHWH, || Even your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. 
Behold, I have set you for a new sharp threshing instrument, || Possessing teeth, you thresh mountains, || And beat small, and make hills as chaff. 
You winnow them, and a wind lifts them up, || And a whirlwind scatters them, || And you rejoice in YHWH, || And boast yourself in the Holy One of Israel. 
The poor and the needy are seeking water, || And there is none, || Their tongue has failed with thirst, || I, YHWH, answer them, || The God of Israel—I do not forsake them. 
I open rivers on high places, || And fountains in midst of valleys, || I make a wilderness become a pond of water, || And a dry land becomes springs of water. 
I give in a wilderness the cedar, || Shittah, and myrtle, and oil-tree, || I set in a desert the fir-pine and box-wood together. 
So that they see, and know, || And regard, and act wisely together, || For the hand of YHWH has done this, || And the Holy One of Israel has created it. 
Bring your cause near, says YHWH, || Bring your mighty ones near, says the King of Jacob. 
They bring them near, and declare to us that which happens, || Declare the first things—what they are, || And we set our heart, and know their latter end, || Or cause us to hear the coming things. 
Declare the things that are coming hereafter, || And we know that you are gods, || Indeed, you may do good or do evil, || And we look around and see it together. 
Behold, you are of nothing, and your work of nothing, || An abomination—it fixes on you. 
I have stirred up one from the north, || And he comes, || From the rising of the sun he calls in My Name, || And he comes in on prefects as on clay, || And as a potter treads down mire. 
Who has declared from the first, and we know? And formerly, and we say, “Righteous?” Indeed, there is none declaring, || Indeed, there is none proclaiming, || Indeed, there is none hearing your sayings. 
First to Zion, || Behold, behold them, || And to Jerusalem I give one proclaiming tidings, 
And I see that there is no man, || Indeed, of these that there is no counselor, || And I ask them, and they return word: 
“Behold, all of them are vanity, || Their works are nothing, || Their molten images are wind and emptiness!”
