Job.
Chapter 34.
And Elihu answers and says: 
“Hear, O wise men, my words, || And, O knowing ones, give ear to me. 
For the ear tries words, || And the palate tastes to eat. 
Let us choose judgment for ourselves, || Let us know among ourselves what is good. 
For Job has said, I have been righteous, || And God has turned aside my right, 
Against my right do I lie? My arrow is mortal—without transgression. 
Who is a man like Job? He drinks scoffing like water, 
And he has traveled for company || With workers of iniquity, || So as to go with men of wickedness. 
For he has said, It does not profit a man || When he delights himself with God. 
Therefore, O men of heart, listen to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, || And from the Mighty to do perverseness, 
For He repays the work of man to him, || And according to the path of each He causes him to find. 
Indeed, truly, God does not do wickedly, || And the Mighty does not pervert judgment. 
Who has inspected for Himself the earth? And who has placed all the habitable world? 
If He sets His heart on him, || If He gathers His Spirit and His breath to Himself, 
All flesh expires together, || And man returns to dust. 
And if there is understanding, hear this, || Give ear to the voice of my words. 
Indeed, does one hating justice govern? Or do you condemn the Most Just? 
Who has said to a king, Worthless, || To princes, Wicked? 
That has not accepted the person of princes, || Nor has known the rich before the poor, || For all of them are a work of His hands. 
In a moment they die, || And at midnight people shake, || And they pass away, || And they remove the mighty without hand. 
For His eyes are on the ways of each, || And He sees all his steps. 
There is no darkness nor death-shade, || For workers of iniquity to be hidden there; 
For He does not permit man anymore, || To go to God in judgment, 
He breaks the mighty—no searching! And He appoints others in their stead. 
Therefore He knows their works, || And He has overturned by night, || And they are bruised. 
As wicked He has struck them, || In the place of beholders. 
Because that against right || They have turned aside from after Him, || And have considered none of His ways, 
To cause to come to Him || The cry of the poor, || And He hears the cry of the afflicted. 
And He gives rest, and who makes wrong? And hides the face, and who beholds it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, || It is the same. 
From the reigning of a profane man, || From the snares of a people; 
For has any said to God: I have taken away, || I do not do corruptly, 
Besides that which I see, You show me, || If I have done iniquity—I do not add? 
Does He repay by you, that you have refused—That you choose, and not I? And what you have known, speak. 
Let men of heart say to me, || And a wise man is listening to me: 
Job—he does not speak with knowledge, || And his words are not with wisdom. 
My Father! Let Job be tried—to victory, || Because of answers for men of iniquity, 
For he adds to his sin, || He vomits transgression among us, || And multiplies his sayings to God.”
