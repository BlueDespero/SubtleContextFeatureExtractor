Zephaniah.
Chapter 2.
Bend yourselves, indeed, bend, || O nation not desired, 
Before the bringing forth of a statute, || The day has passed on as chaff, || While the heat of the anger of YHWH has not yet come in on you, || While the Day of the anger of YHWH has not yet come in on you, 
Seek YHWH, all you humble of the land, || Who have done His judgment, || Seek righteousness, seek humility, || It may be you are hidden in the Day of the anger of YHWH. 
For Gaza is forsaken, || And Ashkelon is for a desolation, || Ashdod! At noon they cast her forth, || And Ekron is rooted up. 
Behold! O inhabitants of the seacoast, || Nation of the Cherethites, || A word of YHWH is against you, || Canaan, land of the Philistines, || “And I have destroyed you without an inhabitant.” 
And the seacoast has been habitations, || Cottages for shepherds, and folds for a flock. 
And the coast has been for the remnant of the house of Judah, || By them they have pleasure, || In houses of Ashkelon they lie down at evening, || For their God YHWH inspects them, || And He has turned back to their captivity. 
“I have heard the reproach of Moab, || And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, || With which they reproached My people, || And magnify themselves against their border. 
Therefore, as I live,” || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, God of Israel, || “Surely Moab is as Sodom, || And the sons of Ammon as Gomorrah, || An overrunning of nettles and salt-pits, || And a desolation for all time. A remnant of My people seizes them, || And a remnant of My nation inherits them.” 
This is to them for their arrogancy, || Because they have reproached, || And they magnify themselves against the people of YHWH of Hosts. 
Fearful is YHWH against them, || For He made all gods of the land bare, || And all islanders of the nations bow themselves to Him, || Each from his place. 
“Also you, O Cushim, they are pierced of My sword.” 
And He stretches His hand against the north, || And destroys Asshur, || And He sets Nineveh for a desolation, || A dry land like a wilderness. 
And droves have crouched in her midst, || Every beast of the nation, || Both pelican and hedgehog lodge in her knobs, || A voice sings at the window, || “Destruction is at the threshold, || For the cedar-work is exposed.” 
This is the exulting city that is dwelling confidently, || That is saying in her heart, || “I am, and there is none beside me,” || How she has been for a desolation, || A crouching-place for beasts, || Everyone passing by her hisses, || He shakes his hand!
