Hebrews.
Chapter 6.
For this reason, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, we may advance to perfection, not laying again a foundation of conversion from dead works, and of faith on God, 
of the teaching of immersions, also of laying on of hands, also of the resurrection of the dead, and of continuous judgment, 
and this we will do, if God may permit, 
for it is impossible for those once enlightened, having also tasted of the heavenly gift, and having become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 
and tasted the good saying of God, also the powers of the coming age, 
and having fallen away, to renew them again to conversion, having crucified to themselves the Son of God again, and exposed to public shame. 
For the earth, having drunk in the rain coming on it many times, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom it is also dressed, partakes of blessing from God, 
but that which is bearing thorns and briers is disapproved of, and near to cursing, whose end is for burning; 
but we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak, 
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labor of love that you showed to His Name, having ministered to the holy ones and ministering; 
and we desire each one of you to show the same diligence, to the full assurance of the hope to the end, 
that you may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises. 
For God, having made promise to Abraham, seeing He was not able to swear by any greater, swore by Himself, 
saying, “Blessing I will indeed bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you”; 
and so, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise; 
for men swear by the greater, and the oath is for confirmation of the end of all their controversy, 
in which God, more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of His counsel, interposed by an oath, 
that through two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong comfort, having fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope being set before us, 
which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into that within the veil, 
to where a forerunner entered for us—Jesus, having become Chief Priest throughout the age after the order of Melchizedek.
