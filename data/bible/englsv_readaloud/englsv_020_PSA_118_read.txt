Psalms.
Chapter 118.
Give thanks to YHWH, || For He is good, for His kindness is for all time. 
Now let Israel say, || His kindness is for all time. 
Now let the house of Aaron say, || His kindness is for all time. 
Now let those fearing YHWH say, || His kindness is for all time. 
I called YAH from the narrow place, || YAH answered me in a broad place. 
YHWH is for me, || I do not fear what man does to me. 
YHWH is for me among my helpers, || And I look on those hating me. 
Better to take refuge in YHWH, || Than to trust in man, 
Better to take refuge in YHWH, || Than to trust in princes. 
All nations have surrounded me, || In the Name of YHWH I surely cut them off. 
They have surrounded me, || Indeed, they have surrounded me, || In the Name of YHWH I surely cut them off. 
They surrounded me as bees, || They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, || In the Name of YHWH I surely cut them off. 
You have severely thrust me to fall, || And YHWH has helped me. 
YAH is my strength and song, || And He is to me for salvation. 
A voice of singing and salvation, || Is in the tents of the righteous, || The right hand of YHWH is doing valiantly. 
The right hand of YHWH is exalted, || The right hand of YHWH is doing valiantly. 
I do not die, but live, || And recount the works of YAH, 
YAH has severely disciplined me, || And has not given me up to death. 
Open gates of righteousness to me, || I enter into them—I thank YAH. 
This is the gate to YHWH, || The righteous enter into it. 
I thank You, for You have answered me, || And are to me for salvation. 
A stone the builders refused || Has become head of a corner. 
This has been from YHWH, || It is wonderful in our eyes, 
This is the day YHWH has made, || We rejoice and are glad in it. 
Ah, now, O YHWH, please save, || Ah, now, O YHWH, please prosper. 
Blessed is He who is coming || In the Name of YHWH, || We blessed you from the house of YHWH, 
God is YHWH, and He gives light to us, || Direct the festal-sacrifice with cords, || To the horns of the altar. 
You are my God, and I confess You, || My God, I exalt You. 
Give thanks to YHWH, || For He is good, for His kindness is for all time!
