2 Chronicles.
Chapter 27.
Jotham is a son of twenty-five years in his reigning, and he has reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jerushah daughter of Zadok. 
And he does that which is right in the eyes of YHWH, according to all that his father Uzziah did; only, he has not come into the temple of YHWH; and again the people are doing corruptly. 
He has built the Upper Gate of the house of YHWH, and in the wall of Ophel he has built abundantly; 
and he has built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and he has built palaces and towers in the forests. 
And he has fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevails over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley; the sons of Ammon have returned this to him both in the second year and in the third. 
And Jotham strengthens himself, for he has prepared his ways before his God YHWH. 
And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, behold, they are written on the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
He was a son of twenty-five years in his reigning, and he has reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; 
and Jotham lies with his fathers, and they bury him in the City of David, and his son Ahaz reigns in his stead.
