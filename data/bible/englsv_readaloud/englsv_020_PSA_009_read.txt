Psalms.
Chapter 9.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “DEATH OF THE SON.” A PSALM OF DAVID. I confess, O YHWH, with all my heart, || I recount all Your wonders, 
I rejoice and exult in You, || I praise Your Name, O Most High. 
In my enemies turning backward, || They stumble and perish from Your face. 
For You have done my judgment and my right. You have sat on a throne, || Judging with righteousness. 
You have rebuked nations, || You have destroyed the wicked, || You have blotted out their name for all time and forever. 
The enemy—your destructions have been completed forever, || As for cities you have plucked up, || Their memorial has perished with them. 
And YHWH abides for all time, || He is preparing His throne for judgment. 
And He judges the world in righteousness, || He judges the peoples in uprightness. 
And YHWH is a tower for the bruised, || A tower for times of adversity. 
They trust in You who know Your Name, || For You have not forsaken those seeking You, O YHWH. 
Sing praise to YHWH, inhabiting Zion, || Declare His acts among the peoples, 
For He who is seeking for blood || Has remembered them, || He has not forgotten the cry of the afflicted. 
Favor me, O YHWH, || See my affliction by those hating me, || You who lift me up from the gates of death, 
So that I recount all Your praise, || In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Your salvation. 
Nations have sunk in a pit they made, || Their foot has been captured in a net that they hid. 
YHWH has been known, || He has done judgment; By a work of his hands || The wicked has been snared. Meditation. Selah. 
The wicked turn back to Sheol, || All nations forgetting God. 
For the needy is not forgotten forever, || Nor the hope of the humble lost for all time. 
Rise, O YHWH, do not let man be strong, || Let nations be judged before Your face. 
Appoint them to fear, O YHWH, || Let nations know they are men! Selah.
