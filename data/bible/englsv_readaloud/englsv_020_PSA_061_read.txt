Psalms.
Chapter 61.
TO THE OVERSEER. ON STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. BY DAVID. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer. 
I call to You from the end of the land, || In the feebleness of my heart, || You lead me into a rock higher than I. 
For You have been a refuge for me, || A tower of strength because of the enemy. 
I sojourn in Your tent for all ages, || I trust in the secret place of Your wings. Selah. 
For You, O God, have listened to my vows, || You have appointed the inheritance || Of those fearing Your Name. 
You add days to the days of the king, || His years as generation and generation. 
He dwells before God for all time, || Appoint kindness and truth—they keep him. 
So I praise Your Name forever, || When I pay my vows day by day!
