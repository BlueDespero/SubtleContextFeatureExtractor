Exodus.
Chapter 31.
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“See, I have called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
and I fill him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work, 
to devise inventions to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 
and in a carving of stone for settings, and in a carving of wood to work in all work. 
And I, behold, have given with him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and I have given wisdom in the heart of every wise-hearted one, and they have made all that which I have commanded you. 
The Tent of Meeting, and the Ark of Testimony, and the propitiatory covering which is on it, and all the vessels of the tent, 
and the table and its vessels, and the pure lampstand and all its vessels, and the altar of the incense, 
and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, 
and the colored garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for acting as priests in; 
and the anointing oil, and the incense of the spices for the holy place; according to all that I have commanded you—they do.” 
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“And you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Surely you keep My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, to know that I, YHWH, am sanctifying you; 
and you have kept the Sabbath, for it is holy to you, he who is defiling it is certainly put to death—for any who does work in it—that person has even been cut off from the midst of his people. 
For six days work is done, and in the seventh day is a Sabbath of holy rest to YHWH; any who does work in the Sabbath day is certainly put to death, 
and the sons of Israel have observed the Sabbath; to keep the Sabbath throughout their generations is a perpetual covenant— 
it is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel for all time; for in six days YHWH made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day He has ceased and is refreshed.” 
And He gives to Moses, when He finishes speaking with him in Mount Sinai, two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
