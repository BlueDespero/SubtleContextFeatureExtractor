Leviticus.
Chapter 4.
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a person sins through ignorance against any of the commands of YHWH regarding things which are not to be done, and has done something against one of these— 
if the priest who is anointed sins according to the guilt of the people, then he has brought near for his sin which he has sinned a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, to YHWH, for a sin-offering, 
and he has brought in the bullock to the opening of the Tent of Meeting before YHWH, and has laid his hand on the head of the bullock, and has slaughtered the bullock before YHWH. 
And the priest who is anointed has taken of the blood of the bullock, and has brought it into the Tent of Meeting, 
and the priest has dipped his finger in the blood, and sprinkled of the blood seven times before YHWH, at the front of the veil of the holy place; 
and the priest has put of the blood on the horns of the altar of spice-incense before YHWH, which is in the Tent of Meeting, and he pours out all the blood of the bullock at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the opening of the Tent of Meeting. 
And he lifts up from it all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering, the fat which is covering over the innards, and all the fat which is on the innards, 
and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance on the liver above the kidneys—he turns it aside, 
as it is lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest has made them an incense on the altar of the burnt-offering. 
And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its innards, and its dung— 
he has even brought out the whole bullock to the outside of the camp, to a clean place, to the place of the pouring out of the ashes, and he has burned it on the wood with fire; it is burned beside the place of the pouring out of the ashes. 
And if all the congregation of Israel errs ignorantly, and the thing has been hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done something against one of all the commands of YHWH regarding things which are not to be done, and have been guilty; 
when the sin which they have sinned concerning it has been known, then the assembly has brought a bullock near, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and they have brought it in before the Tent of Meeting; 
and the elderly of the congregation have laid their hands on the head of the bullock, before YHWH, and one has slaughtered the bullock before YHWH. 
And the priest who is anointed has brought in of the blood of the bullock to the Tent of Meeting, 
and the priest has dipped his finger in the blood, and has sprinkled seven times before YHWH at the front of the veil, 
and he puts some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before YHWH, which is in the Tent of Meeting; and he pours out all the blood at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the opening of the Tent of Meeting; 
and he lifts up all its fat from it, and has made incense on the altar. 
And he has done to the bullock as he has done to the bullock of the sin-offering, so he does to it; and the priest has made atonement for them, and it has been forgiven them; 
and he has brought out the bullock to the outside of the camp, and has burned it as he has burned the first bullock; it is a sin-offering of the assembly. 
When a prince sins, and has done something against one of all the commands of his God YHWH regarding things which are not to be done, through ignorance, and has been guilty, 
or his sin wherein he has sinned has been made known to him, then he has brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a male, a perfect one, 
and he has laid his hand on the head of the goat, and has slaughtered it in the place where he slaughters the burnt-offering before YHWH; it is a sin-offering. 
And the priest has taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and has put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and he pours out its blood at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, 
and he makes incense on the altar with all its fat, as the fat of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest has made atonement for him because of his sin, and it has been forgiven him. 
And if any person of the people of the land sins through ignorance, by his doing something against one of the commands of YHWH regarding things which are not to be done, and has been guilty, 
or his sin which he has sinned has been made known to him, then he has brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a perfect one, a female, for his sin which he has sinned, 
and he has laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and has slaughtered the sin-offering in the place of the burnt-offering. 
And the priest has taken of its blood with his finger, and has put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and he pours out all its blood at the foundation of the altar, 
and he turns aside all its fat, as the fat has been turned aside from off the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest has made incense on the altar for refreshing fragrance to YHWH; and the priest has made atonement for him, and it has been forgiven him. 
And if he brings in a sheep for his offering, a female for a sin-offering, he brings in a perfect one, 
and he has laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and has slaughtered it for a sin-offering in the place where he slaughters the burnt-offering. 
And the priest has taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and has put it on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and he pours out all its blood at the foundation of the altar, 
and he turns aside all its fat, as the fat of the sheep is turned aside from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest has made them an incense on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of YHWH, and the priest has made atonement for him, for his sin which he has sinned, and it has been forgiven him.”
