Psalms.
Chapter 16.
A MIKTAM OF DAVID. Preserve me, O God, for I trusted in You. 
You have said to YHWH, “You are my Lord”; My goodness is not above You; 
For the holy ones who are in the land, || And the honorable, all my delight is in them. 
Their griefs are multiplied, who have hurried backward; I do not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, || Nor do I take up their names on my lips. 
YHWH is the portion of my share, and of my cup, || You uphold my lot. 
Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, || Indeed, a beautiful inheritance is for me. 
I bless YHWH who has counseled me; Also in the nights my reins instruct me. 
I placed YHWH before me continually, || Because He is at my right hand I am not moved. 
Therefore my heart has been glad, || And my glory rejoices, || Also my flesh dwells confidently: 
For You do not leave my soul to Sheol, || Nor give your Holy One to see corruption. 
You cause me to know the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joys, || Pleasant things are by Your right hand forever!
