1 Peter.
Chapter 5.
Elders who are among you, I exhort you, as a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and a partaker of the glory about to be revealed, 
feed the flock of God that is among you, overseeing not by compulsion, but willingly, neither for shameful gain, but eagerly, 
neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but becoming patterns for the flock, 
and the Chief Shepherd having appeared, you will receive the unfading garland of glory. 
In like manner, you young ones, be subject to elders, and all subjecting yourselves to one another; clothe yourselves with humble-mindedness, because God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble; 
be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that He may exalt you in good time, 
having cast all your care on Him, because He cares for you. 
Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the Devil walks around as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may swallow up, 
whom you must resist, steadfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings of your brotherhood to be accomplished in the world. 
And the God of all grace, who called you to His perpetual glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you; 
to Him is the glory and the power through the ages and the ages! Amen. 
Through Silvanus, the faithful brother as I reckon, I wrote through few words to you, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which you have stood. 
She in Babylon chosen with you greets you, and my son Marcus. 
Greet one another in a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus! Amen.
