Chapter 6.
TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS, ON THE EIGHTH. A PSALM OF DAVID. O YHWH, do not reprove me in Your anger, || Nor discipline me in Your fury. 
Favor me, O YHWH, for I am weak, || Heal me, O YHWH, || For my bones have been troubled, 
And my soul has been troubled greatly, || And You, O YHWH, until when? 
Turn back, O YHWH, draw out my soul, || Save me for Your kindness’ sake. 
For in death there is no memorial of You, || In Sheol, who gives thanks to You? 
I have been weary with my sighing, || I meditate on my bed through all the night, || I dissolve my couch with my tear. 
My eye is old from provocation, || It is old because of all my adversaries, 
Turn from me all you workers of iniquity, || For YHWH heard the voice of my weeping, 
YHWH has heard my supplication, || YHWH receives my prayer. 
All my enemies are greatly ashamed and troubled, || They turn back—ashamed in a moment!
