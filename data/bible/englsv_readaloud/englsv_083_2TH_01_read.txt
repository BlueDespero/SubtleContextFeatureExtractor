The Second Letter of Paul to the Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! 
We always ought to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith increases greatly, and the love of each one of you all abounds to one another, 
so that we ourselves glory in you in the assemblies of God, for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you bear— 
a token of the righteous judgment of God, for your being counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer, 
since it is a righteous thing with God to give back to those troubling you—tribulation, 
and to you who are troubled—rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from Heaven, with messengers of His power, 
in flaming fire, giving vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who will suffer justice—continuous destruction—from the face of the LORD, and from the glory of His strength, 
when He may come to be glorified in His holy ones, and to be wondered at by all those believing—because our testimony was believed among you—in that day; 
for which we also always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of faith in power, 
that the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.
