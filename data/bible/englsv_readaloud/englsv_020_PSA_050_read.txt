Psalms.
Chapter 50.
A PSALM OF ASAPH. The God of gods—YHWH—has spoken, || And He calls to the earth || From the rising of the sun to its going in. 
From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone. 
Our God comes, and is not silent, || Fire devours before Him, || And around Him it has been very tempestuous. 
He calls to the heavens from above, || And to the earth, to judge His people. 
Gather My saints to Me, || Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice. 
And the heavens declare His righteousness, || For God Himself is judging. Selah. 
Hear, O My people, and I speak, || O Israel, and I testify against you, || God—I am your God. 
I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, || Indeed, your burnt-offerings || Are continually before Me. 
I do not take a bullock from your house, || Or male goats from your folds. 
For every beast of the forest is Mine, || The livestock on the hills of oxen. 
I have known every bird of the mountains, || And the wild beast of the field is with Me. 
If I am hungry I do not tell it to you, || For the world and its fullness is Mine. 
Do I eat the flesh of bulls, || And drink the blood of male goats? 
Sacrifice to God confession, || And complete your vows to the Most High. 
And call Me in a day of adversity, || I deliver you, and you honor Me. 
And to the wicked God has said: What to you—to recount My statutes? That you lift up My covenant on your mouth? 
Indeed, you have hated instruction, || And cast My words behind you. 
If you have seen a thief, || Then you are pleased with him, || And your portion is with adulterers. 
You have sent forth your mouth with evil, || And your tongue joins deceit together, 
You sit, you speak against your brother, || You give slander against a son of your mother. 
These you did, and I kept silent, || You have thought that I am like you, || I reprove you, and set in array before your eyes. 
Now understand this, || You who are forgetting God, || Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer. 
He who is sacrificing praise honors Me, || As for him who makes a way, || I cause him to look on the salvation of God!
