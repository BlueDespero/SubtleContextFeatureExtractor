Amos.
Chapter 9.
I have seen the Lord standing by the altar, and He says, || “Strike the knob, and the thresholds shake, || And cut them off by the head—all of them, || And I slay their posterity with a sword, || None that flee of them flee away, || Nor a fugitive of them escape. 
If they dig through into Sheol, || From there My hand takes them, || And if they go up to the heavens, || From there I cause them to come down. 
And if they are hid in the top of Carmel, || From there I search out, and have taken them, || And if they are hid from My eyes in the bottom of the sea, || From there I command the serpent, || And it has bitten them. 
And if they go into captivity before their enemies, || From there I command the sword, || And it has slain them, || And I have set My eye on them for evil, || And not for good.” 
And it is the Lord, YHWH of Hosts, || Who is striking against the land, and it melts, || And mourned have all the inhabitants in it, || And all of it has come up as a flood, || And it has sunk—like the flood of Egypt. 
Who is building His upper chambers in the heavens; As for His troop, || On earth He has founded it, || Who is calling for the waters of the sea, || And pours them out on the face of the land, || YHWH is His Name. 
“Are you not as sons of Cushim to Me, O sons of Israel?” A declaration of YHWH. “Did I not bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir? 
Behold, the eyes of Lord YHWH are on the sinful kingdom, || And I have destroyed it from off the face of the ground, || Only, I do not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“For behold, I am commanding, || And I have shaken among all the nations the house of Israel, || As one shakes with a sieve, || And there does not fall a grain to the earth. 
By sword all sinners of My people die, || Who are saying, || Evil does not overtake, or go before, || For our sakes. 
In that day I raise the dwelling place of David that is fallen, || And I have repaired their breaches, || And I raise up its ruins, || And I have built it up as in days of old, 
So that they possess the remnant of Edom, || And all the nations on whom My Name is called,” || A declaration of YHWH—the doer of this. 
“Behold, days are coming,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “And the plowman has come near to the reaper, || And the treader of grapes to the scatterer of seed, || And the mountains have dropped juice, || And all the hills melt. 
And I have turned back to the captivity of My people Israel, || And they have built desolate cities, and inhabited, || And have planted vineyards, and drunk their wine, || And made gardens, and eaten their fruit. 
And I have planted them on their own ground, || And they are not plucked up anymore from off their own ground, || That I have given to them,” said your God YHWH!
