Ezekiel.
Chapter 20.
And it comes to pass, in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, men from the elderly of Israel have come in to seek YHWH, and they sit before me; 
and there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Son of man, speak to the elderly of Israel, and you have said to them, Thus said Lord YHWH: Are you coming in to seek Me? As I live—I am not sought by you—a declaration of Lord YHWH. 
Do you judge them? Do you judge, son of man? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers, 
and you have said to them, Thus said Lord YHWH: In the day of My fixing on Israel, || I lift up My hand, || To the seed of the house of Jacob, || And am known to them in the land of Egypt, || And I lift up My hand to them, || Saying, I am your God YHWH. 
In that day I lifted up My hand to them, || To bring them forth from the land of Egypt, || To a land that I spied out for them, || Flowing with milk and honey, || It is a beauty to all the lands, 
And I say to them, Let each cast away the detestable things of his eyes, || And do not be defiled with the idols of Egypt, || I am your God YHWH. 
And they rebel against Me, || And have not been willing to listen to Me, || Each has not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, || And have not forsaken the idols of Egypt, || And I speak—to pour out My fury on them, || To complete My anger against them, || In the midst of the land of Egypt. 
And I do it for My Name’s sake, || Not to defile it before the eyes of the nations, || In whose midst they are in, || Before whose eyes I became known to them, || To bring them out from the land of Egypt. 
And I bring them out of the land of Egypt, || And I bring them into the wilderness, 
And I give My statutes to them, || And I caused them to know My judgments, || Which the man who does—lives by them. 
And I have also given My Sabbaths to them, || To be for a sign between Me and them, || To know that I am YHWH who is sanctifying them. 
And the house of Israel rebels against Me in the wilderness, || They have not walked in My statutes, || And they have despised My judgments, || Which the man who does—lives by them. And they have greatly defiled My Sabbaths, || And I speak—to pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
And I do it for My Name’s sake, || Not to defile it before the eyes of the nations, || Before whose eyes I brought them forth. 
And also, I have lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, || Not to bring them into the land that I had given, || Flowing with milk and honey, || It is a beauty to all the lands, 
Because they kicked against My judgments, || And they have not walked in My statutes, || And they have defiled My Sabbaths, || For their heart is going after their idols. 
And My eye has pity on them—against destroying them, || And I have not made an end of them in the wilderness. 
And I say to their sons in the wilderness: Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, || And do not observe their judgments, || And do not defile yourselves with their idols. 
I am your God YHWH, walk in My statutes, || And observe My judgments, and do them, 
And sanctify My Sabbaths, || And they have been for a sign between Me and you, || To know that I am your God YHWH. 
And the sons rebel against Me, || They have not walked in My statutes, || And they have not observed My judgments—to do them, || Which the man who does—lives by them. They have defiled My Sabbaths, || And I speak—to pour out My fury on them, || To complete My anger against them in the wilderness. 
And I have turned back My hand, || And I do it for My Name’s sake, || Not to defile it before the eyes of the nations, || Before whose eyes I brought them out. 
I also, I have lifted up My hand to them in the wilderness, || To scatter them among nations, || And to spread them through lands. 
Because they have not done My judgments, || And they have despised My statutes, || And they have defiled My Sabbaths, || And their eyes have been after the idols of their fathers. 
And I also, I have given statutes to them that are not good, || And judgments by which they do not live. 
And I defile them by their own gifts, || By causing every opener of a womb to pass away, || So that I make them desolate, || So that they know that I am YHWH. 
Therefore, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and you have said to them, Thus said Lord YHWH: Still in this your fathers have reviled Me, || In their committing a trespass against Me. 
And I bring them into the land, || That I lifted up My hand to give to them, || And they see every high hill, and every thick tree, || And they sacrifice their sacrifices there, || And give the provocation of their offering there, || And make their refreshing fragrance there, || And they pour out their drink-offerings there. 
And I say to them: What is the high place to where you are going in?” And its name is called “High Place” to this day. 
“Therefore, say to the house of Israel, Thus said Lord YHWH: Are you defiling yourselves in the way of your fathers? And do you go whoring after their detestable things? 
And in the offering of your gifts, || In causing your sons to pass through fire, || You are defiled by all your idols to this day, || And I am sought by you, O house of Israel? As I live—a declaration of Lord YHWH, I am not sought by you. 
And that which is going up on your mind, || It is not at all—in that you are saying: We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands, || To serve wood and stone. 
As I live—a declaration of Lord YHWH, || Do I not, with a strong hand, || And with an outstretched arm, || And with poured out fury—rule over you? 
And I have brought you forth from the peoples, || And assembled you from the lands || In which you have been scattered, || With a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, || And with poured out fury. 
And I have brought you into the wilderness of the peoples, || And have been judged with you there face to face. 
As I was judged with your fathers, || In the wilderness of the land of Egypt, || So I am judged with you, || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
And I have caused you to pass under the rod, || And brought you into the bond of the covenant, 
And cleared out the rebels from you, || And those transgressing against Me, || I bring them out from the land of their sojournings, || And they do not come to the land of Israel, || And you have known that I am YHWH. 
And you, O house of Israel, thus said Lord YHWH: Each go, serve his idols, || And afterward, if you are not listening to Me anyway, || But you do not defile My holy Name anymore by your gifts, and by your idols. 
For on My holy mountain, || On the mountain of the height of Israel, || A declaration of Lord YHWH, || All the house of Israel serves Me there, || All of it, in the land—I accept them there, || And I seek your raised-offerings there, || And with the first-fruit of your gifts, || With all your holy things. 
With refreshing fragrance I accept you, || In My bringing you out from the peoples, || And I have assembled you from the lands || In which you have been scattered, || And I have been sanctified in you || Before the eyes of the nations. 
And you have known that I am YHWH, || In My bringing you to the ground of Israel, || To the land that I lifted up My hand || To give it to your fathers, 
And you have remembered your ways there, || And all your doings, || In which you have been defiled, || And you have been loathsome in your own faces, || For all your evils that you have done. 
And you have known that I am YHWH, || In My dealing with you for My Name’s sake, || Not according to your evil ways, || And according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, || A declaration of Lord YHWH.” 
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Son of man, set your face the way of Teman, and prophesy to the south, and prophesy to the forest of the field—the south; 
and you have said to the forest of the south, Hear a word of YHWH! Thus said Lord YHWH: Behold, I am kindling a fire in you, || And it has devoured every moist tree in you, and every dry tree, || The glowing flames are not quenched, || And all faces from south to north have been burned by it. 
And all flesh has seen, that I, YHWH, have kindled it—it is not quenched.” 
And I say, “Aah! Lord YHWH, || They are saying of me, || Is he not using allegories?”
