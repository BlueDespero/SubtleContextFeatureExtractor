Ezekiel.
Chapter 6.
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Son of man, set your face toward mountains of Israel, and prophesy concerning them: 
And you have said, Mountains of Israel, || Hear a word of Lord YHWH! Thus said Lord YHWH, || To the mountains, and to the hills, || To the streams, and to the valleys: Behold, I am bringing in a sword against you, || And I have destroyed your high places. 
And your altars have been desolated, || And your images have been broken, || And I have caused your wounded to fall before your idols, 
And I have put the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their idols, || And I have scattered your bones around your altars. 
In all your dwellings the cities are laid waste, || And the high places are desolate, || So that your altars are dry and desolate, || Your idols have broken and ceased, || And your images have been cut down, || And your works have been blotted out. 
And the wounded has fallen in your midst, || And you have known that I am YHWH. 
And I have caused some to remain, || In their being for you the escaped of the sword among nations, || In your being scattered through lands. 
And your escaped have remembered Me among nations, || To where they have been taken captive, || Because I have been broken with their heart that is going whoring, || That has turned aside from off Me, || And with their eyes they are going whoring after their idols, || And they have been loathsome in their own faces, || For the evils that they have done—all their abominations. 
And they have known that I am YHWH, || I have not spoken to do this evil to them for nothing. 
Thus said Lord YHWH: Strike with your palm, and stamp with your foot, || And say: Aah! For all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, || Which falls by sword, by famine, and by pestilence. 
The far-off dies by pestilence, || And the near falls by sword, || And the left and the besieged dies by famine, || And I have completed My fury on them. 
And you have known that I am YHWH, || In their wounded being in the midst of their idols, || Around their altars, || On every high hill, on all tops of mountains, || And under every green tree, and under every thick oak, || The place where they gave refreshing fragrance to all their idols. 
And I have stretched out My hand against them, || And have made the land a desolation, || Even a desolation from the wilderness to Diblath, || In all their dwellings, || And they have known that I am YHWH!”
