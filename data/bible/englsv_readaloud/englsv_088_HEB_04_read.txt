Hebrews.
Chapter 4.
We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, anyone of you may seem to have come short, 
for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard, 
for we enter into the rest—we who believed, as He said, “So I swore in My anger, They will not enter into My rest”; and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world, 
for He spoke in a certain place concerning the seventh day thus: “And God rested in the seventh day from all His works”; 
and in this place again, “They will not enter into My rest”; 
since then, it remains for some to enter into it, and those who first heard good news did not enter in because of unbelief— 
again He limits a certain day, “Today,” in David saying, after so long a time, as it has been said, “Today, if you may hear His voice, you may not harden your hearts,” 
for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken after these things concerning another day; 
there remains, then, a Sabbath rest to the people of God, 
for he who entered into His rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own. 
May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one may fall in the same example of the unbelief, 
for the Word of God is living, and working, and sharper—beyond every two-edged sword—and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of joints and also marrows, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart; 
and there is not a created thing hidden before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes—with whom is our reckoning. 
Having, then, a great Chief Priest having passed through the heavens—Jesus the Son of God—may we hold fast the profession, 
for we do not have a Chief Priest unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One tempted in all things in like manner, yet without sin; 
we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace—for seasonable help.
