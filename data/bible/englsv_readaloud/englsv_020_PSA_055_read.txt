Psalms.
Chapter 55.
TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. Give ear, O God, to my prayer, || And do not hide from my supplication. 
Attend to me, and answer me, || I mourn in my meditation, and make a noise, 
Because of the voice of an enemy, || Because of the oppression of the wicked, || For they cause sorrow to move against me, || And in anger they hate me. 
My heart is pained within me, || And terrors of death have fallen on me. 
Fear and trembling come to me, || And horror covers me. 
And I say, “Who gives to me a pinion as a dove?” I fly away and rest, 
Behold, I move far off, || I lodge in a wilderness. Selah. 
I hurry escape for myself, || From a rushing wind, from a whirlwind. 
Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue, || For I saw violence and strife in a city. 
By day and by night they go around it, on its walls. Both iniquity and perverseness are in its midst, 
Mischiefs are in its midst. Fraud and deceit do not depart from its street. 
For an enemy does not reproach me, or I bear it, || He who is hating me || Has not magnified himself against me, || Or I hide from him. 
But you, a man—as my equal, || My familiar friend, and my acquaintance. 
When together we sweeten counsel, || We walk into the house of God in company. 
Desolations are on them, || They go down to Sheol—alive, || For wickedness is in their dwelling, in their midst. 
I call to God, and YHWH saves me. 
Evening, and morning, and noon, || I meditate, and make a noise, and He hears my voice, 
He has ransomed my soul in peace || From him who is near to me, || For with the multitude they were with me. 
God hears and afflicts them, || And He sits of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and do not fear God, 
He has sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, || He has defiled his covenant. 
His mouth has been sweeter than honey, || And his heart is war! His words have been softer than oil, || And they are drawn swords. 
Cast on YHWH that which He has given you, || And He sustains you, || He does not permit the moving of the righteous forever. 
And You, O God, bring them down || To a pit of destruction, || Men of blood and deceit do not reach to half their days, || And I trust in You!
