Lamentations.
Chapter 5.
Remember, O YHWH, what has befallen us, || Look attentively, and see our reproach. 
Our inheritance has been turned to strangers, || Our houses to foreigners. 
Orphans we have been—without a father, our mothers are as widows. 
We have drunk our water for money, || Our wood comes for a price. 
For our neck we have been pursued, || We have labored—there has been no rest for us. 
To Egypt we have given a hand, || To Asshur, to be satisfied with bread. 
Our fathers have sinned—they are not, || We have borne their iniquities. 
Servants have ruled over us, || There is no deliverer from their hand. 
With our lives we bring in our bread, || Because of the sword of the wilderness. 
Our skin as an oven has been burning, || Because of the raging of the famine. 
Wives in Zion they have humbled, || Virgins—in cities of Judah. 
Princes have been hanged by their hand, || Elderly faces have not been honored. 
They have taken young men to grind, || And youths have stumbled with wood. 
Elderly have ceased from the gate, || Young men from their song. 
The joy of our heart has ceased, || Our dancing has been turned to mourning. 
The crown has fallen from our head, || Woe is now to us, for we have sinned. 
Our heart has been sick for this, || Our eyes have been dim for these. 
For the Mount of Zion—that is desolate, || Foxes have gone up on it. 
You, O YHWH, remain for all time, || Your throne to generation and generation. 
Why do You forget us forever? You forsake us for the length of our days! 
Turn us back, O YHWH, to You, || And we turn back, renew our days as of old. 
For have You utterly rejected us? You have been angry against us—exceedingly?
