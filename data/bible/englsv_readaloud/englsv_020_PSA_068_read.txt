Psalms.
Chapter 68.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM. A SONG OF DAVID. God rises and His enemies are scattered! And those hating Him flee from His face. 
You drive them away as the driving away of smoke, || As the melting of wax before fire, || The wicked perish at the presence of God. 
And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, || And they rejoice with gladness. 
Sing to God—praise His Name, || Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, || In YAH is His Name, and exult before Him. 
Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, || Is God in His holy habitation. 
God—causing the lonely to dwell at home, || Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, || Only—the stubborn have inhabited a dry place. 
O God, in Your going forth before Your people, || In Your stepping through the wilderness, Selah. 
The earth has shaken, || Indeed, the heavens have dropped before God, || This Sinai—before God, the God of Israel. 
You shake out a shower of free-will gifts, O God. Your inheritance, when it has been weary, || You have established it. 
Your creature has dwelt in it, || You prepare for the poor in Your goodness, O God. 
The Lord gives the saying, || The female proclaimers are a numerous host. 
Kings of hosts utterly flee away, || And a female inhabitant of the house apportions spoil. 
Though you lie between two boundaries, || Wings of a dove covered with silver, || And her pinions with yellow gold. 
When the Mighty spreads kings in it, it snows in Salmon. 
A hill of God is the hill of Bashan, || A hill of heights is the hill of Bashan. 
Why do you envy, O high hills, || The hill God has desired for His seat? YHWH also dwells forever. 
The chariots of God are myriads, thousands of changes, || The Lord is among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary. 
You have ascended on high, || You have taken captivity captive, || You have taken gifts for men, || That even the stubborn may rest, O YAH God. 
Blessed is the Lord, day by day He lays on us. God Himself is our salvation. Selah. 
God Himself is to us a God for deliverances, || And YHWH Lord has the outgoings of death. 
Only—God strikes || The head of His enemies, || The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt. 
The Lord said: “From Bashan I bring back, || I bring back from the depths of the sea. 
So that you dash your foot || In the blood of enemies—the tongue of Your dogs.” 
They have seen Your goings, O God, || Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary. 
Singers have been before, || Behind are players on instruments, || Virgins playing with timbrels in the midst. 
In assemblies bless God, || The Lord—from the fountain of Israel. 
There is little Benjamin, their ruler, || Heads of Judah their defense, || Heads of Zebulun—heads of Naphtali. 
Your God has commanded your strength, || Be strong, O God, You have worked this for us. 
Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, || Kings bring a present to You. 
Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a herd of bulls, || With calves of the peoples, || Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, || You scatter peoples delighting in conflicts. 
Fat ones come out of Egypt, || Cush causes her hands to run to God. 
Kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, || Praise the Lord! Selah. 
To Him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, || Behold, He gives with His voice a strong voice. 
Ascribe strength to God, || His excellence is over Israel, and His strength in the clouds. 
Fearful, O God, out of Your sanctuaries, || The God of Israel Himself, || Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed is God!
