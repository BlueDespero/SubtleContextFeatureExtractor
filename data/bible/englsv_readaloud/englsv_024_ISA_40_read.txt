Isaiah.
Chapter 40.
“Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God. 
Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her, || That her warfare has been completed, || That her punishment has been accepted, || That she has received from the hand of YHWH || Double for all her sins. 
A voice is crying in a wilderness: “Prepare the way of YHWH, || Make straight in a desert a highway for our God. 
Every valley is raised up, || And every mountain and hill become low, || And the crooked place has become a plain, || And the entangled places a valley. 
And the glory of YHWH has been revealed, || And all flesh have seen it together, || For the mouth of YHWH has spoken.” 
A voice is saying, “Call,” || And he said, “What do I call?” All flesh is grass, and all its goodness || Is as a flower of the field: 
Grass has withered, the flower faded, || For the Spirit of YHWH blew on it, || Surely the people is grass; 
Grass has withered, the flower faded, || But a word of our God rises forever. 
Get up on a high mountain, O Zion, || Proclaiming tidings, || Lift up your voice with power, O Jerusalem, proclaiming tidings, || Lift up, do not fear, say to cities of Judah, “Behold, your God.” 
Behold, Lord YHWH comes with strength, || And His arm is ruling for Him, || Behold, His hire is with Him, and His wage before Him. 
He feeds His flock as a shepherd, || He gathers lambs with His arm, || And He carries them in His bosom: He leads suckling ones. 
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, || And has meted out the heavens by a span, || And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, || And has weighed the mountains in scales, || And the hills in a balance? 
Who has meted out the Spirit of YHWH, || And being His counselor, teaches Him? 
With whom did He consult, || That he causes Him to understand? And teaches Him in the path of judgment, || And teaches Him knowledge? And causes Him to know the way of understanding? 
Behold, nations are as a drop from a bucket, || And have been reckoned as small dust of the balance, || Behold, He takes up islands as a small thing. 
And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, || Nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering. 
All the nations are as nothing before Him, || Less than nothing and emptiness, || They have been reckoned to Him. 
And to whom do you liken God, || And what likeness do you compare to Him? 
An artisan has poured out the carved image, || And a refiner spreads it over with gold, || And he is refining chains of silver. 
He who is poor by raised-offerings, || Chooses a tree that is not rotten, || He seeks a skillful artisan for it, || To establish a carved image—not moved. 
Do you not know—do you not hear? Has it not been declared from the first to you? Have you not understood || From the foundations of the earth? 
He who is sitting on the circle of the earth, || And its inhabitants are as grasshoppers, || He who is stretching out the heavens as a thin thing, || And spreads them as a tent to dwell in. 
He who is making princes become nothing, || Has made judges of earth formless; 
Indeed, they have not been planted, || Indeed, they have not been sown, || Indeed, their stock is not taking root in the earth, || And He has also blown on them, and they wither, || And a whirlwind takes them away as stubble. 
And to whom do you liken Me, || And to whom I equal? Says the Holy One. 
Lift up your eyes on high, || And see—who has created these? He who is bringing out their host by number, || He calls to all of them by name, || By the abundance of His strength || And mighty power, || Not one is lacking. 
Why say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, “My way has been hid from YHWH, || And from my God my judgment passes over?” 
Have you not known? Have you not heard? The God of the age—YHWH, || Preparer of the ends of the earth, || Is not wearied nor fatigued, || There is no searching of His understanding. 
He is giving power to the weary, || And to those not strong He increases might. 
Even youths are wearied and fatigued, || And young men utterly stumble, 
But those expecting YHWH pass to power, || They raise up the pinion as eagles, || They run and are not fatigued, || They go on and do not faint!
