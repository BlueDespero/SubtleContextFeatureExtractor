Proverbs.
Chapter 17.
Better is a dry morsel, and rest with it, || Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife. 
A wise servant rules over a son causing shame, || And he apportions an inheritance in the midst of brothers. 
A refining pot is for silver, and a furnace for gold, || And the trier of hearts is YHWH. 
An evildoer is attentive to lips of vanity, || Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue. 
Whoever is mocking at the poor || Has reproached his Maker, || Whoever is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted. 
Sons’ sons are the crown of old men, || And the glory of sons are their fathers. 
A lip of excellence is not fitting for a fool, much less a lip of falsehood for a noble. 
A stone of grace is the bribe in the eyes of its possessors, || Wherever it turns, it prospers. 
Whoever is covering transgression is seeking love, || And whoever is repeating a matter || Is separating a familiar friend. 
Rebuke comes down on the intelligent || More than one hundred stripes on a fool. 
An evil man seeks only rebellion, || And a fierce messenger is sent against him. 
The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man, || And—not a fool in his folly. 
Whoever is returning evil for good, || Evil does not move from his house. 
The beginning of contention is a letting out of waters, || And leave the strife before it is meddled with. 
Whoever is justifying the wicked, || And condemning the righteous, || Even both of these are an abomination to YHWH. 
Why is this—a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, || And a heart—there is none? 
The friend is loving at all times, || And a brother is born for adversity. 
A man lacking heart is striking hands, || He becomes a guarantor before his friend. 
Whoever is loving transgression is loving debate, || Whoever is making his entrance high is seeking destruction. 
The perverse of heart does not find good, || And the one turned in his tongue falls into evil. 
Whoever is begetting a fool has affliction for it, || Indeed, the father of a fool does not rejoice. 
A rejoicing heart does good to the body, || And a struck spirit dries the bone. 
The wicked takes a bribe from the bosom, || To turn aside the paths of judgment. 
The face of the intelligent is to wisdom, || And the eyes of a fool—at the end of the earth. 
A foolish son is a provocation to his father, || And bitterness to her bearing him. 
Also, it is not good to fine the righteous, || To strike nobles for uprightness. 
One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, || And the cool of temper is a man of understanding. 
Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, || He who is shutting his lips seems intelligent!
