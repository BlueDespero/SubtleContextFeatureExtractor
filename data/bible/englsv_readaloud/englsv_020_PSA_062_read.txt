Psalms.
Chapter 62.
TO THE OVERSEER. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID. Toward God alone is my soul silent, || My salvation is from Him. 
He alone is my rock, and my salvation, || My tower, I am not much moved. 
Until when do you devise mischief against a man? All of you are destroyed, || As a wall inclined, a hedge that is cast down. 
Only—from his excellence || They have consulted to drive away, || They enjoy a lie, they bless with their mouth, || And revile with their heart. Selah. 
For God alone, be silent, O my soul, || For my hope is from Him. 
He alone is my rock and my salvation, || My tower, I am not moved. 
On God is my salvation, and my glory, || The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God. 
Trust in Him at all times, O people, || Pour forth your heart before Him, || God is a refuge for us. Selah. 
Surely vanity the low, a lie the high. In balances to go up || They are lighter than a breath. 
Do not trust in oppression, || And do not become vain in robbery, || Do not set the heart on wealth when it increases. 
Once has God spoken, twice I heard this, || That “strength is with God.” 
And with You, O Lord, is kindness, || For You repay to each, || According to his work!
