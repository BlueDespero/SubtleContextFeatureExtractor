Psalms.
Chapter 15.
A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, who sojourns in Your tent? Who dwells in Your holy hill? 
He who is walking uprightly, || And working righteousness, || And speaking truth in his heart. 
He has not slandered by his tongue, || He has not done evil to his friend; And he has not lifted up reproach || Against his neighbor. 
A rejected one is despised in his eyes, || And he honors those fearing YHWH. He has sworn to endure evil, and does not change; 
He has not given his silver in usury, || And has not taken a bribe against the innocent; Whoever is doing these is not moved for all time!
