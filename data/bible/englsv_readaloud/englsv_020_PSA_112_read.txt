Psalms.
Chapter 112.
Praise YAH! ALEPH-BET O the blessedness of one fearing YHWH, || He has greatly delighted in His commands. 
His seed is mighty in the earth, || The generation of the upright is blessed. 
Wealth and riches are in his house, || And his righteousness is standing forever. 
Light has risen in darkness to the upright, || Gracious, and merciful, and righteous. 
The man—good, gracious, and lending, || He sustains his matters in judgment. 
For he is not moved for all time; For the righteous is a continuous memorial. 
He is not afraid of an evil report, || His heart is prepared and confident in YHWH. 
His heart is sustained—he does not fear, || Until he looks on his adversaries. 
He has scattered—has given to the needy, || His righteousness is standing forever, || His horn is exalted with glory. 
The wicked sees, and has been angry, || He gnashes his teeth, and has melted, || The desire of the wicked perishes!
