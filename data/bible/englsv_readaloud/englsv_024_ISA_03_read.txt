Isaiah.
Chapter 3.
For behold, the Lord, YHWH of Hosts, || Is turning aside from Jerusalem and from Judah || Both stay and staff: Every stay of bread and every stay of water; 
Mighty and man of war, judge and prophet, || And diviner and elderly, 
Head of fifty, and accepted of faces, || And counselor, and wise craftsmen, || And discerning charmer. 
And I have made youths their heads, || And sucklings rule over them. 
And the people has exacted—man on man, || Even a man on his neighbor, || The youths enlarge themselves against the aged, || And the lightly esteemed against the honored. 
When one lays hold on his brother, || Of the house of his father, by the garment, “Come, you are a ruler to us, || And this ruin is under your hand.” 
He lifts up, in that day, saying, “I am not a binder up, || And in my house is neither bread nor garment, || You do not make me a ruler of the people.” 
For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, || For their tongue and their doings are against YHWH, || To provoke the eyes of His glory. 
The appearance of their faces witnessed against them, || And their sin, as Sodom, they declared, || They have not hidden! Woe to their soul, || For they have done evil to themselves. 
Say to the righteous that it is good, || Because they eat the fruit of their doings. 
Woe to the wicked—evil, || Because the deed of his hand is done to him. 
My people—its exactors are sucklings, || And women have ruled over it. My people—your eulogists are causing to err, || And the way of your paths swallowed up. 
YHWH has stood up to plead, || And He is standing to judge the peoples. 
YHWH enters into judgment || With the elderly of His people, and its heads: “And you, you have consumed the vineyard, || Plunder of the poor is in your houses. 
Why? Why do you do this? You bruise My people, || And you grind the faces of the poor.” A declaration of the Lord, YHWH of Hosts, || And YHWH says: 
“Because that daughters of Zion have been haughty, || And they walk stretching out the neck, || And deceiving with the eyes, || They go walking and mincing, || And they make a jingling with their feet, 
The Lord has also scabbed || The crown of the head of daughters of Zion, || And YHWH exposes their simplicity. 
In that day the Lord turns aside || The beauty of the jingling ornaments, || And of the embroidered works, || And of the crescents, 
Of the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils, 
Of the headdresses, and the ornaments of the legs, || And of the bands, || And of the perfume boxes, and the amulets, 
Of the seals, and of the nose-rings, 
Of the costly apparel, and of the mantles, || And of the coverings, and of the purses, 
Of the mirrors, and of the linen garments, || And of the hoods, and of the veils, 
And it has been, instead of spice is muck, || And instead of a girdle, a rope, || And instead of curled work, baldness, || And instead of a stomacher a girdle of sackcloth. 
For instead of glory, your men fall by sword, || And your might in battle. 
And her openings have lamented and mourned, || Indeed, she has been emptied, she sits on the earth!”
