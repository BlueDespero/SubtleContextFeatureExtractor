2 Samuel.
Chapter 22.
And David speaks the words of this song to YHWH in the day YHWH has delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul, 
and he says: “YHWH is my rock, || And my bulwark, and a deliverer to me, 
My God is my rock—I take refuge in Him; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, || My high tower, and my refuge! My Savior, You save me from violence! 
I call on YHWH, who is worthy to be praised: And I am saved from my enemies. 
When the breakers of death surrounded me, || The streams of the worthless terrify me, 
The cords of Sheol have surrounded me, || The snares of death have been before me. 
In my adversity I call on YHWH, || And I call to my God, || And He hears my voice from His temple, || And my cry is in His ears, 
And the earth shakes and trembles, || Foundations of the heavens are troubled, || And are shaken, for He has wrath! 
Smoke has gone up by His nostrils, || And fire devours from His mouth; Brands have been kindled by it. 
And He inclines the heavens and comes down, || And thick darkness is under His feet. 
And He rides on a cherub and flies, || And is seen on the wings of the wind. 
And He sets darkness around Him for His dwelling places, || Darkness of waters and thick clouds of the skies. 
From the brightness before Him || Brands of fire were kindled! 
YHWH thunders from the heavens, || And the Most High gives forth His voice. 
And He sends forth arrows, and scatters them; Lightning, and troubles them; 
And the streams of the sea are seen, || The foundations of the world are revealed, || By the rebuke of YHWH, || From the breath of the spirit of His anger. 
He sends from above—He takes me, || He draws me out of many waters. 
He delivers me from my strong enemy, || From those hating me, || For they were stronger than me. 
They are before me in a day of my calamity, || And YHWH is my support, 
And He brings me out to a large place, || He draws me out for He delighted in me. 
YHWH repays me, || According to my righteousness, || According to the cleanness of my hands, He returns to me. 
For I have kept the ways of YHWH, || And have not done wickedly against my God. 
For all His judgments are before me, || As for His statutes, I do not turn from them. 
And I am perfect before Him, || And I keep myself from my iniquity. 
And YHWH returns to me, || According to my righteousness, || According to my cleanness before His eyes. 
With the kind You show Yourself kind, || With the perfect man You show Yourself perfect, 
With the pure You show Yourself pure, || And with the perverse You show Yourself a wrestler. 
And You save the poor people, || But Your eyes on the high cause them to fall. 
For You are my lamp, O YHWH, || And YHWH lightens my darkness. 
For by You I run against a troop, || By my God I leap a wall. 
God—His way is perfect, || The saying of YHWH is tried, || He is a shield to all those trusting in Him. 
For who is God except YHWH? And who is the Rock except our God? 
God—my bulwark, my strength, || And He makes my way perfect; 
Making my feet like does, || And causes me to stand on my high places, 
Teaching my hands for battle, || And a bow of bronze was brought down by my arms, 
And You give the shield of Your salvation to me, || And Your lowliness makes me great. 
You enlarge my step under me, || And my ankles have not slipped. 
I pursue my enemies and destroy them, || And I do not turn until they are consumed. 
And I consume them, and strike them, || And they do not rise, and fall under my feet. 
And You gird me with strength for battle, || You cause my withstanders to bow under me. 
And my enemies—You give to me the neck, || Those hating me—and I cut them off. 
They look, and there is no savior; To YHWH, and He has not answered them. 
And I beat them as dust of the earth, || As mire of the streets I beat them small—I spread them out! 
And You deliver me || From the strivings of my people, || You place me for a head of nations; A people I have not known serve me. 
Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me, || At the hearing of the ear they listen to me. 
Sons of a stranger fade away, || And gird themselves by their close places. 
YHWH lives, and blessed is my Rock, || And exalted is my God—The Rock of my salvation. 
God—who is giving vengeance to me, || And bringing down peoples under me, 
And bringing me forth from my enemies, || Indeed, You raise me up above my withstanders. You deliver me from a man of violence. 
Therefore I confess You, O YHWH, among nations, || And I sing praise to Your Name. 
Magnifying the salvations of His king, || And doing loving-kindness to His anointed, || To David, and to his seed—for all time!”
