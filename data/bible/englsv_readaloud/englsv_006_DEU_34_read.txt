Deuteronomy.
Chapter 34.
And Moses goes up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, the top of Pisgah, which is on the front of Jericho, and YHWH shows him all the land—Gilead to Dan, 
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah to the Western Sea, 
and the south, and the circuit of the Valley of Jericho, the city of palms, to Zoar. 
And YHWH says to him, “This is the land which I have sworn to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I give it to your seed; I have caused you to see with your eyes, but you do not pass over there.” 
And Moses, servant of the Lord, dies there in the land of Moab, according to the command of YHWH; 
and He buries him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-Peor, and no man has known his burying place to this day. 
And Moses is a son of one hundred and twenty years when he dies; his eye has not become dim, nor has his moisture fled. 
And the sons of Israel lament Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses are completed. 
And Joshua son of Nun is full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him, and the sons of Israel listen to him, and do as YHWH commanded Moses. 
And there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses anymore, whom YHWH has known face to face, 
in reference to all the signs and the wonders which YHWH sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
and in reference to all the strong hand and to all the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
