Psalms.
Chapter 22.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “DOE OF THE MORNING.” A PSALM OF DAVID. My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Far from My salvation, || The words of My roaring? 
My God, I call by day, and You do not answer, || And by night, and am not silent. 
And You are holy, || Sitting—the Praise of Israel. 
In You our fathers trusted; They trusted, and You deliver them. 
To You they cried, and were delivered, || In You they trusted, and were not disappointed. 
And I am a worm, and no man, || A reproach of man, and despised of the people. 
All beholding Me mock at Me, || They make free with the lip—shake the head, 
“Roll to YHWH, He delivers Him, || He delivers Him, for He delighted in Him.” 
For You are He bringing Me forth from the womb, || Causing Me to trust, || On the breasts of My mother. 
On You I have been cast from the womb, || From the belly of My mother You are My God. 
Do not be far from Me, || For adversity is near, for there is no helper. 
Many bulls have surrounded Me, || Mighty ones of Bashan have surrounded Me, 
They have opened their mouth against Me, || A lion tearing and roaring. 
I have been poured out as waters, || And all my bones have separated themselves, || My heart has been like wax, || It is melted in the midst of My bowels. 
My power is dried up as an earthen vessel, || And My tongue is cleaving to My jaws. 
And You appoint Me to the dust of death, || For dogs have surrounded Me, || A company of evildoers has surrounded Me, || Piercing My hands and My feet. 
I count all My bones—they look expectingly, || They look on Me, 
They apportion My garments to themselves, || And they cause a lot to fall for My clothing. 
And You, O YHWH, do not be far off, || O My strength, hurry to help Me. 
Deliver My soul from the sword, || My only one from the paw of a dog. 
Save Me from the mouth of a lion || And You have answered Me from the horns of the high places! 
I declare Your Name to My brothers, || In the midst of the assembly I praise You. 
You who fear YHWH, praise Him, || All the seed of Jacob, honor Him, || And be afraid of Him, all you seed of Israel. 
For He has not despised, nor detested, || The affliction of the afflicted, || Nor has He hidden His face from Him, || And in His crying to Him He hears. 
Of You My praise is in the great assembly. I complete My vows before His fearers. 
The humble eat and are satisfied, || Those seeking Him praise YHWH, || Your heart lives forever. 
Remember and return to YHWH, || Do all the ends of the earth, || And bow themselves before You, || Do all families of the nations, 
For to YHWH is the kingdom, || And He is ruling among nations. 
And the fat ones of earth have eaten, || And they bow themselves, || All going down to dust bow before Him, || And he who has not revived his soul. 
A seed serves Him, || It is declared of the Lord to the generation. 
They come and declare His righteousness, || To a people that is born, that He has made!
