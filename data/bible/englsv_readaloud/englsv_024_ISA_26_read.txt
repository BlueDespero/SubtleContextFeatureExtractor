Isaiah.
Chapter 26.
In that day this song is sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city, || He makes salvation for walls and bulwark. 
Open the gates, || That a righteous nation may enter, || Preserving steadfastness. 
You keep him in peace whose imagination is stayed—peace! For he is confident in You. 
Trust in YHWH forever, || For in YAH—YHWH is a rock of ages, 
For He bowed down the dwellers on high, || A city set on high He makes low, || He makes it low to the earth, || He causes it to come to the dust, 
A foot treads it down, || Feet of the poor—steps of the weak. 
The path for the righteous is uprightness, || O upright One, || You ponder the path of the righteous. 
Also, in the path of Your judgments, || O YHWH, we have waited for You, || To Your Name and to Your remembrance || Is the desire of the soul. 
I desired You in the night with my soul, || Also, I seek You earnestly with my spirit within me, || For when Your judgments are on the earth, || The inhabitants of the world have learned righteousness. 
The wicked finds favor, || He has not learned righteousness, || He deals perversely in a land of straightforwardness, || And does not see the excellence of YHWH. 
O YHWH, Your hand is high—they do not see, || They see the zeal of the people, and are ashamed, || Also, the fire consumes Your adversaries. 
O YHWH, You appoint peace to us, || For You have also worked all our works for us. 
O our God YHWH, lords have ruled us besides You, || Only, by You we make mention of Your Name. 
Dead—they do not live, || Rephaim, they do not rise, || Therefore You have inspected and destroy them, || Indeed, you destroy all their memory. 
You have added to the nation, O YHWH, || You have added to the nation, || You have been honored, || You have put all the ends of the earth far off. 
O YHWH, in distress they missed You, || They have poured out a whisper, || Your discipline is on them. 
When a pregnant woman comes near to the birth, || She is pained—she cries in her pangs, || So we have been from Your face, O YHWH. 
We have conceived, we have been pained. We have brought forth, as it were, wind, || We do not work salvation in the earth, || Nor do the inhabitants of the world fall. 
Your dead live—My dead body, they rise. Awake and sing, you dwellers in the dust, || For the dew of herbs is your dew, || And you cause the land of Rephaim to fall. 
Come, My people, enter into your inner chambers, || And shut your doors behind you, || Hide yourself shortly for a moment until the indignation passes over. 
For behold, YHWH is coming out of His place, || To charge the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth on him, || And the earth has revealed her blood, || Nor does she cover her slain anymore!”
