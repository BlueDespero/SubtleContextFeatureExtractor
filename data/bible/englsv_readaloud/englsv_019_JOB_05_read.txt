Job.
Chapter 5.
“Pray, call, is there any to answer you? And to which of the holy ones do you turn? 
For provocation slays the perverse, || And envy puts to death the simple, 
I have seen the perverse taking root, || And I mark his habitation straight away, 
His sons are far from safety, || And they are bruised in the gate, || And there is no deliverer. 
Whose harvest the hungry eat, || And even take it from the thorns, || And the designing swallowed their wealth. 
For sorrow does not come forth from the dust, || Nor does misery spring up from the ground. 
For man is born to misery, || And the sparks go high to fly. 
Yet I inquire for God, || And for God I give my word, 
Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, until there is no numbering. 
Who is giving rain on the face of the land, || And is sending waters on the out-places. 
To set the low on a high place, || And the mourners have been high in safety. 
Making void thoughts of the cunning, || And their hands do not execute wisdom. 
Capturing the wise in their subtlety, || And the counsel of wrestling ones was hurried, 
By day they meet darkness, || And as night—they grope at noon. 
He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth, || And from a strong hand, 
And there is hope for the poor, || And perverseness has shut her mouth. 
Behold, the blessedness of mortal man, || God reproves him: And do not despise the discipline of the Mighty, 
For He pains, and He binds up, || He strikes, and His hands heal. 
In six distresses He delivers you, || And in seven evil does not strike on you. 
In famine He has redeemed you from death, || And in battle from the hands of the sword. 
When the tongue scourges you are hid, || And you are not afraid of destruction, || When it comes. 
At destruction and at hunger you mock, || And of the beast of the earth, || You are not afraid. 
(For with sons of the field is your covenant, || And the beast of the field || Has been at peace with you.) 
And you have known that your tent is peace, || And inspected your habitation, and do not err, 
And have known that your seed is numerous, || And your offspring as the herb of the earth; 
You come in full age to the grave, || As the going up of a stalk in its season. 
Behold, this—we searched it out—it is right, listen; And you, know for yourself!”
