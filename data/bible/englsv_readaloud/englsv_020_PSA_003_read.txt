Psalms.
Chapter 3.
A PSALM OF DAVID, IN HIS FLEEING FROM THE FACE OF HIS SON ABSALOM. YHWH, how my distresses have multiplied! Many are rising up against me. 
Many are saying of my soul, “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah. 
And You, O YHWH, are a shield for me, || My glory, and lifter up of my head. 
My voice is to YHWH: I call and He answers me from His holy hill, Selah. 
I have lain down, and I sleep, || I have awoken, for YHWH sustains me. 
I am not afraid of myriads of people, || That they have set against me all around. 
Rise, O YHWH! Save me, my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek. You have broken the teeth of the wicked. 
This salvation is of YHWH; Your blessing is on Your people! Selah.
