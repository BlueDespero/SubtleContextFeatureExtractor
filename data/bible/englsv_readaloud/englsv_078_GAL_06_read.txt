Galatians.
Chapter 6.
Brothers, even if a man may be overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering yourself—lest you also may be tempted. 
Bear the burdens of one another, and so fill up the law of the Christ, 
for if anyone thinks himself to be something—being nothing—he deceives himself; 
and let each one prove his own work, and then he will have the glorying in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to the other, 
for each one will bear his own burden. 
And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing in all good things. 
Do not be led astray: God is not mocked; for what a man may sow—that he will also reap, 
because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh will reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit will reap continuous life; 
and in doing good we should not be weary, for at the proper time we will reap—not desponding; 
therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially to those of the household of faith. 
You see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand; 
as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised—only that they may not be persecuted for the Cross of the Christ, 
for neither do those circumcised keep the Law themselves, but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 
And for me, let it not be—to glory, except in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world; 
for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation; 
and as many as walk by this rule—peace on them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God! 
From now on, let no one give me trouble, for I carry the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit, brothers! Amen.
