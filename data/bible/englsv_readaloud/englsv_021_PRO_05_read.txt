Proverbs.
Chapter 5.
My son! Give attention to my wisdom, || Incline your ear to my understanding, 
To observe thoughtfulness, || And your lips keep knowledge. 
For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, || And her mouth is smoother than oil, 
And her latter end is bitter as wormwood, || Sharp as a sword with mouths. 
Her feet are going down to death, || Her steps take hold of Sheol. 
The path of life—lest you ponder, || Her paths have moved—you do not know. 
And now, you sons, listen to me, || And do not turn from sayings of my mouth. 
Keep your way far from off her, || And do not come near to the opening of her house, 
Lest you give your splendor to others, || And your years to the fierce, 
Lest strangers be filled with your power, || And your labors in the house of a stranger, 
And you have howled in your latter end, || In the consumption of your flesh and your food, 
And have said, “How I have hated instruction, || And my heart has despised reproof, 
And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, || And have not inclined my ear to my teachers. 
As a little thing I have been all evil, || In the midst of an assembly and a congregation.” 
Drink waters out of your own cistern, || Even flowing ones out of your own well. 
Let your fountains be scattered abroad, || In broad places streams of waters. 
Let them be to you for yourself, || And not to strangers with you. 
Let your fountain be blessed, || And rejoice because of the wife of your youth, 
A doe of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy you at all times, || Magnify yourself in her love continually. 
And why do you magnify yourself, || My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman? 
For the ways of each are before the eyes of YHWH, || And He is pondering all his paths. 
His own iniquities capture the wicked, || And he is holden with the ropes of his sin. 
He dies without instruction, || And magnifies himself in the abundance of his folly!
