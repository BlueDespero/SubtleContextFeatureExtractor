Psalms.
Chapter 102.
A PRAYER OF THE AFFLICTED WHEN HE IS FEEBLE, AND POURS OUT HIS COMPLAINT BEFORE YHWH. O YHWH, hear my prayer, indeed, my cry comes to You. 
Do not hide Your face from me, || In a day of my adversity, || Incline Your ear to me, || In the day I call, hurry, answer me. 
For my days have been consumed in smoke, || And my bones have burned as a firebrand. 
Struck as the herb, and withered, is my heart, || For I have forgotten to eat my bread. 
From the voice of my sighing || My bone has cleaved to my flesh. 
I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, || I have been as an owl of the dry places. 
I have watched, and I am || As a bird alone on the roof. 
All the day my enemies reproached me, || Those mad at me have sworn against me. 
Because I have eaten ashes as bread, || And have mingled my drink with weeping, 
From Your indignation and Your wrath, || For You have lifted me up, || And cast me down. 
My days are stretched out as a shadow, || And I am withered as the herb. 
And You, O YHWH, abide for all time, || And Your memorial from generation to generation. 
You rise—You pity Zion, || For the time to favor her, || For the appointed time has come. 
For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, || And they favor her dust. 
And nations fear the Name of YHWH, || And all kings of the earth Your glory, 
For YHWH has built Zion, || He has been seen in His glory, 
He turned to the prayer of the destitute, || And He has not despised their prayer. 
This is written for a later generation, || And the people created praise YAH. 
For He has looked || From the high place of His sanctuary. YHWH looked attentively from the heavens to earth, 
To hear the groan of the prisoner, || To loose sons of death, 
To declare in Zion the Name of YHWH, || And His praise in Jerusalem, 
In the peoples being gathered together, || And the kingdoms—to serve YHWH. 
He has humbled my power in the way, || He has shortened my days. 
I say, “My God, do not take me up in the midst of my days,” || Your years are through all generations. 
You founded the earth before time, || And the heavens are the work of Your hands. 
They perish, and You remain, || And all of them become old as a garment, || You change them as clothing, || And they are changed. 
And You are the same, and Your years are not finished. 
The sons of Your servants continue, || And their seed is established before You!
