Psalms.
Chapter 129.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Often they distressed me from my youth, || Pray, let Israel say: 
Often they distressed me from my youth, || Yet they have not prevailed over me. 
Plowers have plowed over my back, || They have made their furrows long. 
YHWH is righteous, || He has cut apart cords of the wicked. 
All hating Zion are confounded and turn backward. 
They are as grass of the roofs, || That withers before it was drawn out, 
That has not filled the hand of a reaper, || And the bosom of a binder of sheaves. 
And the passers by have not said, “The blessing of YHWH is on you, || We blessed you in the Name of YHWH!”
