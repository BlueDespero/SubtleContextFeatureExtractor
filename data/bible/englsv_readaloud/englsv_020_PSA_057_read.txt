Psalms.
Chapter 57.
TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, IN HIS FLEEING FROM THE FACE OF SAUL INTO A CAVE. Favor me, O God, favor me, || For my soul is trusting in You, || And I trust in the shadow of Your wings, || Until the calamities pass over. 
I call to God Most High, || To God who is perfecting for me. 
He sends from the heavens, and saves me, || He reproached the one who is panting after me. Selah. God sends forth His kindness and His truth. 
My soul is in the midst of lions, || I lie down among flames—sons of men, || Their teeth are a spear and arrows, || And their tongue a sharp sword. 
Be exalted above the heavens, O God, || Your glory above all the earth. 
They have prepared a net for my steps, || My soul has bowed down, || They have dug a pit before me, || They have fallen into its midst. Selah. 
My heart is prepared, O God, || My heart is prepared, || I sing and praise. 
Awake, my glory, awake, stringed instrument and harp, || I awake the morning dawn. 
I thank You among the peoples, O Lord, || I praise You among the nations. 
For Your kindness is great to the heavens, || And Your truth to the clouds. 
Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Your glory above all the earth!
