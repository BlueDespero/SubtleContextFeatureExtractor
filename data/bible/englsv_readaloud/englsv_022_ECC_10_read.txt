Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 10.
Dead flies cause a perfumer’s perfume || To send forth a stink; The precious by reason of wisdom—By reason of honor—a little folly! 
The heart of the wise is at his right hand, || And the heart of a fool at his left. 
And also, when he that is a fool || Is walking in the way, his heart is lacking, || And he has said to everyone, “He is a fool.” 
If the spirit of the ruler goes up against you, do not leave your place, || For yielding quiets great sinners. 
There is an evil I have seen under the sun, || As ignorance that goes out from the ruler, 
He has set the fool in many high places, || And the rich sits in a low place. 
I have seen servants on horses, || And princes walking as servants on the earth. 
Whoever is digging a pit falls into it, || And whoever is breaking a hedge, a serpent bites him. 
Whoever is removing stones is grieved by them, || Whoever is cleaving trees endangered by them. 
If the iron has been blunt, || And he has not sharpened the face, || Then he increases strength, || And wisdom is advantageous to make right. 
If the serpent bites without enchantment, || Then there is no advantage to a master of the tongue. 
Words of the mouth of the wise are gracious, || And the lips of a fool swallow him up. 
The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly, || And the latter end of his mouth || Is mischievous madness. 
And the fool multiplies words: “Man does not know that which is—And that which is after him, who declares to him?” 
The labor of the foolish wearies him, || In that he has not known to go to the city. 
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a youth, || And your princes eat in the morning. 
Blessed are you, O land, || When your king is a son of nobles, || And your princes eat in due season, || For might, and not for drunkenness. 
By slothfulness is the wall brought low, || And by idleness of the hands the house drops. 
For mirth they are making a feast, || And wine makes life joyful, || And the silver answers with all. 
Even in your mind do not revile a king, || And in the inner parts of your bed-chamber do not revile the rich: For a bird of the heavens causes the voice to go, || And a possessor of wings declares the word.
