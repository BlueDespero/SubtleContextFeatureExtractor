Zechariah.
Chapter 2.
And I lift up my eyes, and look, and behold, a man, and in his hand a measuring line. 
And I say, “To where are you going?” And he says to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see how much is its breadth and how much its length.” 
And behold, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out, and another messenger is going out to meet him, 
and he says to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, || Jerusalem is inhabited as open places, || From the abundance of man and beast in her midst. 
And I am to her—a declaration of YHWH—A wall of fire all around, || And I am for glory in her midst. 
Behold, and flee from the land of the north, || A declaration of YHWH, || For as the four winds of the heavens, || I have spread you abroad, || A declaration of YHWH. 
Behold, Zion, be delivered who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon. 
For thus said YHWH of Hosts: He has sent Me after glory to the nations who are spoiling you, || For he who is coming against you, || Is coming against the pupil of His eye. 
For behold, I am waving My hand against them, || And they have been a spoil to their servants. And you have known that YHWH of Hosts has sent Me. 
Sing, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, || For behold, I am coming, and have dwelt in your midst, || A declaration of YHWH. 
And many nations have been joined to YHWH in that day, || And they have been to Me for a people, || And I have dwelt in your midst, || And you have known that YHWH of Hosts has sent Me to you. 
And YHWH has inherited Judah, || His portion on the holy ground, || And He has fixed again on Jerusalem. 
Hush, all flesh, because of YHWH, || For He has been roused up from His holy habitation!”
