Revelation.
Chapter 9.
And the fifth messenger sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star having fallen to the earth out of Heaven, and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss, 
and he opened the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit. 
And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority, 
and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads, 
and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment—as the torment of a scorpion—when it may strike a man; 
and in those days men will seek death and they will not find it, and they will desire to die, and death will flee from them. 
And the likenesses of the locusts—like to horses made ready to battle, and on their heads something as garlands like gold, and their faces as faces of men, 
and they had hair as hair of women, and their teeth were as those of lions, 
and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings—as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle; 
and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority is to injure men five months; 
and they have over them a king—the messenger of the abyss—a name is to him in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in the Greek he has a name, Apollyon. 
The first woe went forth, behold, there yet come two woes after these things. 
And the sixth messenger sounded the trumpet, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God, 
saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, “Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates”; 
and the four messengers were loosed, who have been made ready for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they may kill the third of mankind; 
and the number of the forces of the horsemen—twice ten thousand ten thousands, and I heard the number of them. 
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses are as heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire, and smoke, and brimstone; 
by these three plagues the third of mankind was killed, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, that is proceeding out of their mouths, 
for the power of the horses are in their mouth, and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and they injure with them. 
And the rest of mankind, who were not killed in these plagues, neither converted from the works of their hands, that they may not worship the demons, and idols, those of gold, and those of silver, and those of brass, and those of stone, and those of wood, that are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk, 
and they did not convert from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their whoredoms, nor from their thefts.
