Proverbs.
Chapter 2.
My son, if you accept my sayings, || And lay up my commands with you, 
To cause your ear to attend to wisdom, || You incline your heart to understanding, 
For if you call for intelligence, || And give forth your voice for intelligence, 
If you seek her as silver, || And search for her as hid treasures, 
Then you understand the fear of YHWH, || And you find the knowledge of God. 
For YHWH gives wisdom, || Knowledge and understanding from His mouth. 
Even to lay up substance for the upright, || A shield for those walking uprightly. 
To keep the paths of judgment, || And He preserves the way of His saints. 
Then you understand righteousness, || And judgment, and uprightness—every good path. 
For wisdom comes into your heart, || And knowledge is pleasant to your soul, 
Thoughtfulness watches over you, || Understanding keeps you, 
To deliver you from an evil way, || From any speaking contrary things, 
Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, || To walk in ways of darkness, 
Who are rejoicing to do evil, || They delight in the contrariness of the wicked, 
Whose paths are crooked, || Indeed, they are perverted in their ways. 
To deliver you from the strange woman, || From the stranger who has made her sayings smooth, 
Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, || And has forgotten the covenant of her God. 
For her house has inclined to death, || And her paths to Rephaim. 
None going in to her return, || Nor do they reach the paths of life. 
That you go in the way of the good, || And keep the paths of the righteous. 
For the upright inhabit the earth, || And the perfect are left in it, 
And the wicked are cut off from the earth, || And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
