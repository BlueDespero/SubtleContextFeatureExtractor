Psalms.
Chapter 27.
BY DAVID. YHWH is my light and my salvation, || Whom do I fear? YHWH is the strength of my life, || Of whom am I afraid? 
When evildoers come near to me to eat my flesh, || My adversaries and my enemies to me, || They have stumbled and fallen. 
Though a host encamps against me, || My heart does not fear, || Though war rises up against me, || In this I am confident. 
One thing I asked of YHWH—it I seek: My dwelling in the house of YHWH, || All the days of my life, || To look on the pleasantness of YHWH, || And to inquire in His temple. 
For He hides me in a dwelling place in the day of evil, || He hides me in a secret place of His tent, || He raises me up on a rock. 
And now my head is lifted up, || Above my enemies—my surrounders, || And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, || I sing, indeed, I sing praise to YHWH. 
Hear, O YHWH, my voice—I call, || And favor me, and answer me. 
My heart said to You, “They sought my face, || Your face, O YHWH, I seek.” 
Do not hide Your face from me, || Do not turn Your servant aside in anger, || You have been my help. Do not leave me, nor forsake me, || O God of my salvation. 
When my father and my mother || Have forsaken me, then YHWH gathers me. 
Show me, O YHWH, Your way, || And lead me in a path of uprightness, || For the sake of my beholders. 
Do not give me to the will of my adversaries, || For false witnesses have risen against me, || And they breathe out violence to me. 
I had not believed to look on the goodness of YHWH || In the land of the living! 
Look to YHWH—be strong, || And He strengthens your heart, || Indeed, look to YHWH!
