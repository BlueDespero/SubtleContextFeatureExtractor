Micah.
Chapter 7.
My woe is to me, || For I have been as gatherings of summer-fruit, || As gleanings of harvest, || There is no cluster to eat, || The first-ripe fruit has my soul desired. 
The kind have perished out of the land, || And upright among men—there are none, || All of them lie in wait for blood, || They each hunt his brother with a net. 
On the evil are both hands to do it well, || The prince is asking—also the judge—for repayment, || And the great—he is speaking the mischief of his soul, || And they wrap it up. 
Their best one is as a brier, || The upright one—than a thorn-hedge, || The day of your watchmen—Your visitation—has come. Now is their perplexity. 
Do not believe in a friend, || Do not trust in a leader, || From her who is lying in your bosom keep the openings of your mouth. 
For a son is dishonoring a father, || A daughter has stood against her mother, || A daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, || The enemies of each are the men of his house. 
And I—in YHWH I watch, || I wait for the God of my salvation, || My God hears me. 
You do not rejoice over me, O my enemy, || When I have fallen, I have risen, || When I sit in darkness YHWH is a light to me. 
I bear the indignation of YHWH, || For I have sinned against Him, || Until He pleads my cause, || And has executed my judgment, || He brings me forth to the light, || I look on His righteousness. 
And my enemy sees, || And shame covers her, || Who says to me, “Where is your God YHWH?” My eyes look on her, || Now she is for a treading-place, || As mire of the out-places. 
The day to build your walls! That day—removed is the limit. 
That day—even to you it comes in, || From Asshur and the cities of the fortress, || And from the fortress even to the river, || And from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain. 
And the land has been for a desolation, || Because of its inhabitants, || Because of the fruit of their doings. 
Rule Your people with Your rod, || The flock of Your inheritance, || Dwelling alone in a forest in the midst of Carmel, || They enjoy Bashan and Gilead as in days of old. 
“According to the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt, || I show it wonderful things.” 
Nations see, and they are ashamed of all their might, || They lay a hand on the mouth, their ears are deaf. 
They lick dust as a serpent, as fearful things of earth, || They tremble from their enclosures, || They are afraid of our God YHWH, || Indeed, they are afraid of You. 
Who is a God like You? Taking away iniquity, || And passing by the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance, || He has not retained His anger forever, || Because He delights in kindness. 
He turns back, He pities us, || He subdues our iniquities, || And You cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 
You give truth to Jacob, kindness to Abraham, || That You have sworn to our fathers, from the days of antiquity!
