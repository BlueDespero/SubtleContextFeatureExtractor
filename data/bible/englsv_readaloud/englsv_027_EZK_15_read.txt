Ezekiel.
Chapter 15.
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Son of man, || What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The vine-branch that has been, || Among trees of the forest? 
Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it? 
Behold, it has been given to the fire for fuel, || The fire has eaten its two ends, || And its midst has been scorched! Is it profitable for work? 
Behold, in its being perfect it is not used for work, || How much less when fire has eaten of it, || And it is scorched, || Has it been used yet for work?” 
Therefore, thus said Lord YHWH: “As the vine-tree among trees of the forest, || That I have given to the fire for fuel, || So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
And I have set My face against them, || They have gone forth from the fire, || And the fire consumes them, || And you have known that I am YHWH, || In My setting My face against them. 
And I have made the land a desolation, || Because they have committed a trespass,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH!
