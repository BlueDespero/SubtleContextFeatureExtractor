Psalms.
Chapter 115.
Not to us, O YHWH, not to us, || But to Your Name give glory, || For Your kindness, for Your truth. 
Why do the nations say, “Where, pray, is their God?” 
And our God is in the heavens, || All that He has pleased He has done. 
Their idols are silver and gold, work of man’s hands, 
They have a mouth, and they do not speak, || They have eyes, and they do not see, 
They have ears, and they do not hear, || They have a nose, and they do not smell, 
Their hands, but they do not handle, || Their feet, and they do not walk; 
Nor do they mutter through their throat, || Their makers are like them, || Everyone who is trusting in them. 
O Israel, trust in YHWH, “He is their help and their shield.” 
O house of Aaron, trust in YHWH, “He is their help and their shield.” 
You fearing YHWH, trust in YHWH, “He is their help and their shield.” 
YHWH has remembered us, He blesses, || He blesses the house of Israel, || He blesses the house of Aaron, 
He blesses those fearing YHWH, || The small with the great. 
YHWH adds to you—to you and to your sons. 
Blessed are you of YHWH, || Maker of the heavens and earth, 
The heavens—the heavens are YHWH’s, || And He has given the earth to sons of men; 
The dead do not praise YAH, || Nor any going down to silence. 
And we, we bless YAH, || From now on, and for all time. Praise YAH!
