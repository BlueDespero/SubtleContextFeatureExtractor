Psalms.
Chapter 46.
TO THE OVERSEER. BY SONS OF KORAH. FOR GIRLS’ VOICES. A SONG. God is our refuge and strength, || A most sure help in adversities. 
Therefore we do not fear in the changing of earth, || And in the slipping of mountains || Into the heart of the seas. 
Roar—troubled are its waters, || Mountains shake in its pride. Selah. 
A river—its streams make glad the city of God, || Your holy place of the dwelling places of the Most High. 
God is in her midst—she is not moved, God helps her at the turn of the morning! 
Nations have been troubled, || Kingdoms have been moved, || He has given forth with His voice—earth melts. 
YHWH of Hosts is with us, || The God of Jacob is a tower for us. Selah. 
Come, see the works of YHWH, || Who has done astonishing things in the earth, 
Causing wars to cease, || To the end of the earth, He shatters the bow, || And He has cut apart the spear, || He burns chariots with fire. 
Desist, and know that I am God, || I am exalted among nations, || I am exalted in the earth. 
YHWH of hosts is with us, || The God of Jacob is a tower for us! Selah.
