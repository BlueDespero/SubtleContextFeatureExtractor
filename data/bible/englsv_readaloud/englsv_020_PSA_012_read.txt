Psalms.
Chapter 12.
TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE EIGHTH. A PSALM OF DAVID. Save, YHWH, for the saintly has failed, || For the steadfast have ceased || From the sons of men: 
They each speak vanity with his neighbor, || Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak. 
YHWH cuts off all lips of flattery, || A tongue speaking great things, 
Who said, “By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?” 
Because of the spoiling of the poor, || Because of the groaning of the needy, || Now I arise, says YHWH, || I set in safety him who breathes for it. 
Sayings of YHWH are pure sayings—Silver tried in a furnace of earth, refined sevenfold. 
You, O YHWH, preserve them, || You keep us from this generation for all time. 
The wicked walk around continually, || According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
