Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. I have called You from the depths, YHWH. 
Lord, listen to my voice, || Your ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
If You observe iniquities, Lord YAH, who stands? 
But forgiveness is with You, that You may be feared. 
I hoped for YHWH—my soul has hoped, || And I have waited for His word. 
My soul is for the Lord, || More than those watching for morning, || Watching for morning! 
Israel waits on YHWH, || For kindness is with YHWH, || And redemption is abundant with Him. 
And He redeems Israel from all his iniquities!
