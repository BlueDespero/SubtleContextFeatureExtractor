Job.
Chapter 11.
And Zophar the Naamathite answers and says: 
“Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified? 
Your boastings make men keep silent, || You scorn, and none is causing blushing! 
And you say, My discourse is pure, || And I have been clean in Your eyes. 
And yet, O that God had spoken! And opens His lips with you. 
And declares to you secrets of wisdom, for counsel has foldings. And know that God forgets of your iniquity for you. 
Do you find out God by searching? To perfection find out the Mighty One? 
Heights of the heavens—what can you do? Deeper than Sheol—what can you know? 
Its measure is longer than earth, and broader than the sea. 
If He passes on, and shuts up, and assembles, || Who then reverses it? 
For He has known men of vanity, || And He sees iniquity, || And one does not consider it! 
And empty man is bold, || And man is born as the colt of a wild donkey. 
If you have prepared your heart, || And have spread out your hands to Him, 
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far off, || And do not let perverseness dwell in your tents. 
For then you lift up your face from blemish, || And you have been firm, and do not fear. 
For you forget misery, || As waters passed away you remember. 
And age rises above the noon, || You fly—you are as the morning. 
And you have trusted because there is hope, || And searched—in confidence you lie down, 
And you have rested, || And none is causing trembling, || And many have begged at your face; 
And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, || And refuge has perished from them, || And their hope is a breathing out of soul!”
