Ezekiel.
Chapter 39.
“And you, son of man, prophesy concerning Gog, and you have said, Thus said Lord YHWH: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, || Chief prince of or prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal, 
And have turned you back, and enticed you, || And caused you to come up from the sides of the north, || And brought you in against mountains of Israel, 
And have struck your bow out of your left hand, || Indeed, I cause your arrows to fall out of your right. 
You fall on mountains of Israel, || You, and all your bands, and the peoples who are with you, || To ravenous bird—a bird of every wing, || And to a beast of the field, I have given you for food. 
You fall on the face of the field, for I have spoken, || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
And I have sent a fire against Magog, || And against the confident inhabitants of the islands, || And they have known that I am YHWH. 
And I make My holy Name known in the midst of My people Israel, || And I do not defile My holy Name anymore, || And the nations have known that I, YHWH, the Holy One, am in Israel. 
Behold, it has come, and it has been done, || A declaration of Lord YHWH, || It is the day of which I spoke. 
And those dwelling in the cities of Israel have gone out, || And they have burned and kindled a fire, || With armor, and shield, and buckler, || With bow, and with arrows, || And with hand weapon, and with javelin, || And they have caused a fire to burn seven years with them, 
And they do not take wood out of the field, || Nor do they hew out of the forests, || For they cause the fire to burn with armor, || And they have spoiled their spoilers, || And they have plundered their plunderers, || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
And it has come to pass in that day, I give a place to Gog there—a grave in Israel, the valley of those passing by, east of the sea, and it is stopping those passing by, and they have buried there Gog, and all his multitude, and have cried, O valley of the multitude of Gog! 
And the house of Israel has buried them—in order to cleanse the land—seven months. 
Indeed, all the people of the land have buried them, and it has been to them for a name—the day of My being honored—a declaration of Lord YHWH. 
And they separate men for continual employment, with those passing through, passing on through the land, burying those who are left on the face of the earth, to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they search. 
And those passing by have passed through the land, and seen a bone of man, and one has constructed a sign near it until those burying have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog. 
And also the name of the city is The Multitude; and they have cleansed the land. 
And you, son of man, thus said Lord YHWH: Say to the bird—every wing, and to every beast of the field: Be assembled and come in, || Be gathered from all around, || For My sacrifice that I am sacrificing for you, || A great sacrifice on mountains of Israel, || And you have eaten flesh, and drunk blood. 
You eat the flesh of the mighty, || And you drink the blood of the princes of the earth, || Of rams, of lambs, and of male goats, || Of calves, fatlings of Bashan—all of them. 
And you have eaten fat to satiety, || And you have drunk blood—to drunkenness, || Of My sacrifice that I sacrificed for you. 
And you have been satisfied at My table with horse and rider, || Mighty man, and every man of war, || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
And I have given My glory among nations, || And all the nations have seen My judgment that I have done, || And My hand that I have laid on them. 
And the house of Israel has known that I am their God YHWH, || From that day and from now on. 
And the nations have known || That the house of Israel was removed for their iniquity, || Because they have trespassed against Me, || And I hide My face from them, || And give them into the hand of their adversaries, || And they fall by sword—all of them. 
According to their uncleanness, || And according to their transgressions, I have done with them, || And I hide My face from them. 
Therefore, thus said Lord YHWH: Now I bring back the captivity of Jacob, || And I have pitied all the house of Israel, || And have been zealous for My holy Name. 
And they have forgotten their shame, || And all their trespass that they trespassed against Me, || In their dwelling on their land confidently and none troubling. 
In My bringing them back from the peoples, || I have assembled them from the lands of their enemies, || And I have been sanctified in them before the eyes of the many nations, 
And they have known that I am their God YHWH, || In My removing them to the nations, || And I have gathered them to their land, || And I leave none of them there anymore. 
And I do not hide My face from them anymore, || In that I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, || A declaration of Lord YHWH!”
