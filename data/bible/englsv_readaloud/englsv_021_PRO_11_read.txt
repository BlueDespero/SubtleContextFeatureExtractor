Proverbs.
Chapter 11.
Balances of deceit are an abomination to YHWH, || And a perfect weight is His delight. 
Pride has come, and shame comes, || And wisdom is with the lowly. 
The integrity of the upright leads them, || And the perverseness of the treacherous destroys them. 
Wealth does not profit in a day of wrath, || And righteousness delivers from death. 
The righteousness of the perfect makes his way right, || And by his wickedness the wicked fall. 
The righteousness of the upright delivers them, || And in mischief the treacherous are captured. 
In the death of a wicked man, hope perishes, || And the expectation of the iniquitous has been lost. 
The righteous is drawn out from distress, || And the wicked goes in instead of him. 
A hypocrite corrupts his friend with the mouth, || And the righteous are drawn out by knowledge. 
A city exults in the good of the righteous, || And in the destruction of the wicked is singing. 
By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted, || And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down. 
Whoever is despising his neighbor lacks heart, || And a man of understanding keeps silence. 
A busybody is revealing secret counsel, || And the faithful of spirit is covering the matter. 
Without counsels a people falls, || And deliverance is in a multitude of counselors. 
An evil one suffers when he has been guarantor for a stranger, || And whoever hates striking hands in agreement is confident. 
A gracious woman retains honor, || And terrible men retain riches. 
A kind man is rewarding his own soul, || And the fierce is troubling his own flesh. 
The wicked is getting a lying wage, || And whoever is sowing righteousness—a true reward. 
Correctly is righteousness for life, || And whoever is pursuing evil—for his own death. 
The perverse of heart are an abomination to YHWH, || And the perfect of the way are His delight. 
Hand to hand, the wicked is not acquitted, || And the seed of the righteous has escaped. 
A ring of gold in the nose of a sow—A beautiful woman and stubborn of behavior. 
The desire of the righteous is only good, || The hope of the wicked is transgression. 
There is one who is scattering, and yet is increased, || And one who is keeping back from uprightness, only to want. 
A liberal soul is made fat, || And whoever is watering, he also is watered. 
Whoever is withholding grain, the people execrate him, || And a blessing is for the head of him who is selling. 
Whoever is earnestly seeking good || Seeks a pleasing thing, || And whoever is seeking evil—it meets him. 
Whoever is confident in his wealth falls, || And as a leaf, the righteous flourish. 
Whoever is troubling his own house inherits wind, || And the fool is a servant to the wise of heart. 
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, || And whoever is taking souls is wise. 
Behold, the righteous is repaid in the earth, || Surely also the wicked and the sinner!
