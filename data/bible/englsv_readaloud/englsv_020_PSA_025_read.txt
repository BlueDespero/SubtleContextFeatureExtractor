Psalms.
Chapter 25.
BY DAVID. ALEPH-BET To You, O YHWH, I lift up my soul. 
My God, in You I have trusted, || Do not let me be ashamed, || Do not let my enemies exult over me. 
Also let none waiting on You be ashamed, || Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed. 
Your ways, O YHWH, cause me to know, || You teach me Your paths. 
Cause me to tread in Your truth, and teach me, || For You are the God of my salvation, || Near You I have waited all the day. 
Remember Your mercies, O YHWH, || And Your kindnesses, for they are from the age. 
Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, || Do not remember. According to Your kindness be mindful of me, || For Your goodness’ sake, O YHWH. 
Good and upright is YHWH, || Therefore He directs sinners in the way. 
He causes the humble to tread in judgment, || And teaches the humble His way. 
All the paths of YHWH are kindness and truth, || To those keeping His covenant, || And His testimonies. 
For Your Name’s sake, O YHWH, || You have pardoned my iniquity, for it is great. 
Who is this—the man fearing YHWH? He directs him in the way He chooses. 
His soul remains in good, || And his seed possesses the land. 
The secret of YHWH is for those fearing Him, || And His covenant—to cause them to know. 
My eyes are continually to YHWH, || For He brings my feet out from a net. 
Turn to me, and favor me, || For I am lonely and afflicted. 
The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, || Bring me out from my distresses. 
See my affliction and my misery, || And bear with all my sins. 
See my enemies, for they have been many, || And they have hated me with violent hatred. 
Keep my soul, and deliver me, || Do not let me be ashamed, for I trusted in You. 
Integrity and uprightness keep me, || For I have waited on You. 
Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
