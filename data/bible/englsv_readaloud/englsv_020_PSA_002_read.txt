Psalms.
Chapter 2.
Why have nations assembled tumultuously? And peoples meditate vanity? 
Kings of the earth station themselves, and princes have been united together, against YHWH, and against His Messiah: 
“Let us draw off Their cords, || And cast Their thick bands from us.” 
He who is sitting in the heavens laughs, || The Lord mocks at them. 
Then He speaks to them in His anger, and in His wrath He troubles them: 
“And I have anointed My King, || On Zion—My holy hill.” 
I declare concerning a statute: YHWH said to me, “You are My Son, today I have brought You forth. 
Ask of Me and I give nations as Your inheritance, || And the ends of the earth for Your possession. 
You rule them with a scepter of iron, || You crush them as a vessel of a potter.” 
And now, O kings, act wisely, || Be instructed, O judges of earth, 
Serve YHWH with fear, || And rejoice with trembling. 
Kiss the Chosen One or Son, lest He is angry, || And you perish from the way, || When His anger burns but a little, || O the blessedness of all trusting in Him!
