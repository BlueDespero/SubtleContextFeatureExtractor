Isaiah.
Chapter 39.
At that time, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, has sent letters and a present to Hezekiah when he hears that he has been sick and has become strong. 
And Hezekiah rejoices over them, and shows them the house of his spices, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good ointment, and all the house of his vessels, and all that has been found in his treasures; there has not been a thing in his house, and in all his dominion, that Hezekiah has not showed them. 
And Isaiah the prophet comes to King Hezekiah and says to him, “What did these men say? And from where do they come to you?” And Hezekiah says, “They have come to me from a far-off land—from Babylon.” 
And he says, “What did they see in your house?” And Hezekiah says, “They saw all that is in my house; there has not been a thing that I have not showed them among my treasures.” 
And Isaiah says to Hezekiah, “Hear a word of YHWH of Hosts: 
Behold, days are coming, and all that is in your house, and that your fathers have treasured up until this day, has been carried to Babylon; there is not a thing left, said YHWH; 
and of your sons who come forth from you, whom you beget, they take, and they have been eunuchs in a palace of the king of Babylon.” 
And Hezekiah says to Isaiah, “The word of YHWH that you have spoken is good”; and he says, “Because there is peace and truth in my days.”
