Zechariah.
Chapter 5.
And I turn back, and lift up my eyes, and look, and behold, a flying scroll. 
And he says to me, “What are you seeing?” And I say, “I am seeing a flying scroll, its length is twenty by the cubit, and its breadth is ten by the cubit.” 
And he says to me, “This is the execration that is going forth over the face of all the land, for everyone who is stealing, on the one side, according to it, has been declared innocent, and everyone who has sworn, on the other side, according to it, has been declared innocent.” 
“I have brought it out,” a declaration of YHWH of Hosts, “and it has come into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who has sworn in My Name with a falsehood, and it has remained in the midst of his house, and has consumed it, both its wood and its stones.” 
And the messenger who is speaking with me goes forth and says to me, “Now lift up your eyes, and do you see what this is that is coming forth?” 
And I say, “What is it?” And he says, “This—the ephah that is coming forth.” And he says, “This is their aspect in all the land. 
And behold, a disc of lead lifted up; and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.” 
And he says, “This is the wicked woman.” And he casts her into the midst of the ephah, and casts the weight of lead on its mouth. 
And I lift up my eyes, and see, and behold, two women are coming forth, and wind is in their wings; and they have wings like wings of the stork, and they lift up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. 
And I say to the messenger who is speaking with me, “To where are they causing the ephah to go?” 
And he says to me, “To build a house for it in the land of Shinar.” And it has been prepared and has been placed there on its base.
