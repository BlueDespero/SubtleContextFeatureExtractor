Psalms.
Chapter 59.
TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, IN SAUL’S SENDING, AND THEY WATCH THE HOUSE TO PUT HIM TO DEATH. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God, || Set me on high from my withstanders. 
Deliver me from workers of iniquity, || And save me from men of blood. 
For behold, they laid wait for my soul, || Strong ones are assembled against me, || Not my transgression nor my sin, O YHWH. 
Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, || Stir up to meet me, and see. 
And You, YHWH, God of Hosts, God of Israel, || Awake to inspect all the nations. Do not favor any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah. 
They return at evening, || They make a noise like a dog, || And go around the city. 
Behold, they belch out with their mouths, || Swords are in their lips, for “Who hears?” 
And You, O YHWH, laugh at them, || You mock at all the nations. 
O my Strength, to You I take heed, || For God is my tower—the God of my kindness. 
God goes before me, || He causes me to look on my enemies. 
Do not slay them, lest my people forget, || Shake them by Your strength, || And bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
The sin of their mouth is a word of their lips, || And they are captured in their pride, || And they recount from the curse and lying. 
Consume in fury, consume and they are not, || And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, || To the ends of the earth. Selah. 
And they return at evening, || They make a noise like a dog, || And they go around the city. 
They wander for food, || If they are not satisfied—then they murmur. 
And I sing of Your strength, || And at morning I sing of Your kindness, || For You have been a tower to me, || And a refuge for me in a day of adversity. 
O my Strength, I sing praise to You, || For God is my tower, the God of my kindness!
