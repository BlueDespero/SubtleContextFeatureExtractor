2 Chronicles.
Chapter 19.
And Jehoshaphat king of Judah turns back to his house in peace, to Jerusalem, 
and Jehu son of Hanani the seer goes out to his presence and says to King Jehoshaphat, “Do you love to give help to the wicked and to those hating YHWH? And for this, wrath is against you from before YHWH, 
but good things have been found with you, for you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.” 
And Jehoshaphat dwells in Jerusalem, and he turns back and goes out among the people from Beer-Sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brings them back to YHWH, God of their fathers. 
And he establishes judges in the land, in all the fortified cities of Judah, for every city, 
and says to the ones judging, “See what you are doing—for you do not judge for man, but for YHWH, who is with you in the matter of judgment; 
and now, let fear of YHWH be on you, observe and do, for there is not perverseness with our God YHWH, and favoring by appearance, and taking of a bribe.” 
And also in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat has appointed of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of YHWH, and for strife; and they return to Jerusalem, 
and he lays a charge on them, saying, “Thus do you do in the fear of YHWH, in faithfulness, and with a perfect heart, 
and any strife that comes to you of your brothers who are dwelling in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and command, statutes, and judgments, then you have warned them and they do not become guilty before YHWH, and wrath has not been on you and on your brothers; thus do you do, and you are not guilty. 
And behold, Amariah the head priest is over you for every matter of YHWH, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the house of Judah, is for every matter of the king, and the Levites are officers before you; be strong and do, and YHWH is with the good.”
