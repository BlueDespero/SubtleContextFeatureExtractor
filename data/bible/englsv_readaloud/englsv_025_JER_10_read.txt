Jeremiah.
Chapter 10.
Hear the word, O house of Israel, || That YHWH has spoken for you. 
Thus said YHWH: “Do not accustom yourselves to the way of the nations, || And do not be frightened by the signs of the heavens, || For the nations are frightened by them. 
For the statutes of the peoples are vanity, || For one has cut a tree from a forest, || Work of the hands of a craftsman, with an axe, 
They beautify it with silver and with gold, || They fix it with nails and with hammers, || And it does not stumble. 
They are stiff as a palm, and they do not speak, || They are surely carried, for they do not step, || Do not be afraid of them, for they do no evil, || Indeed, to do good is also not in them.” 
Because there is none like You, O YHWH, || You are great, and Your Name is great in might. 
Who does not fear You, King of the nations? For it is befitting to You, || For among all the wise of the nations, || And in all their kingdom, there is none like You. 
And as one they are brutish and foolish, || An instruction of vanities is the tree itself. 
Spread-out silver is brought from Tarshish, || And gold from Uphaz, || Work of an artisan, and of the hands of a refiner, || Their clothing is blue and purple, || Work of the skillful—all of them. 
And YHWH is a God of truth, || He is a living God, and a perpetual King, || The earth shakes from His wrath, || And nations do not endure His indignation. 
Thus you say to them, “The gods who have not made the heavens and earth, || They perish from the earth, || And from under these heavens.” 
The Maker of the earth by His power, || The Establisher of the world by His wisdom, || Who, by His understanding, stretched forth the heavens— 
When He gives forth His voice, || A multitude of waters is in the heavens, || And He causes vapors to come up from the end of the earth, || He has made lightnings for rain, || And brings out wind from His treasures. 
Every man is brutish by knowledge, || Every refiner is put to shame by a carved image, || For his molten image is false. And there is no breath in them. 
They are vanity, work of erring ones, || They perish in the time of their inspection. 
The Portion of Jacob is not like these, || For He is the Framer of all things, || And Israel is the rod of His inheritance, || YHWH of Hosts is His Name. 
Gather your merchandise from the land, || O dweller in the bulwark, 
For thus said YHWH: “Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time, || And have been an adversary to them, || So that they are found out.” 
Woe to me for my breaking, || My striking has been grievous, || And I said, “Surely this is my sickness, and I bear it.” 
My tent has been spoiled, || And all my cords have been broken, || My sons have gone out from me, and they are not, || There is none stretching out my tent anymore, || And raising up my curtains. 
For the shepherds have become brutish, || And they have not sought YHWH, || Therefore they have not acted wisely, || And all their flock is scattered. 
A voice of a report, behold, it has come, || Even a great shaking from the north country, || To make the cities of Judah a desolation, || A habitation of dragons. 
I have known, O YHWH, that not of man is his way, || Not of man is the going and establishing of his step. 
Discipline me, O YHWH, only in judgment, || Not in Your anger, lest You make me small. 
Pour out Your fury on the nations that have not known You, || And on the families that have not called on Your Name, || For they have eaten up Jacob, || Indeed, they have eaten him up, indeed, they consume him, || And they have made his habitation desolate!
