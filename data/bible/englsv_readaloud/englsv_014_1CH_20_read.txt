1 Chronicles.
Chapter 20.
And it comes to pass, at the time of the turn of the year—at the time of the going out of the messengers—that Joab leads out the force of the host, and destroys the land of the sons of Ammon, and comes in and besieges Rabbah—David is abiding in Jerusalem—and Joab strikes Rabbah, and breaks it down. 
And David takes the crown of their king from off his head, and finds it to be a talent of gold in weight, and with precious stone in it, and it is on the head of David; and he has brought out very much spoil of the city, 
and he has brought out the people who are in it, and sets them to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes; and thus David does to all cities of the sons of Ammon, and David turns back—and all the people—to Jerusalem. 
And it comes to pass after this, that war remains in Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbechai the Hushathite has struck Sippai, of the children of the giant, and they are humbled. 
And there is war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan son of Jair strikes Lahmi, brother of Goliath the Gittite, the wood of whose spear is like a weavers’ beam. 
And there is war in Gath again, and there is a man of great measure, and his fingers and his toes are six and six—twenty-four total, and he has also been born to the giant. 
And he reproaches Israel, and Jonathan son of Shimea, brother of David, strikes him. 
These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
