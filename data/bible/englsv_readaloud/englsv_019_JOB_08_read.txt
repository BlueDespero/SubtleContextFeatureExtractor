Job.
Chapter 8.
And Bildad the Shuhite answers and says: 
“Until when do you speak these things? And a strong wind—sayings of your mouth? 
Does God pervert judgment? And does the Mighty One pervert justice? 
If your sons have sinned before Him, || And He sends them away, || By the hand of their transgression, 
If you seek for God early, || And make supplication to the Mighty, 
If you are pure and upright, || Surely now He wakes for you, || And has completed || The habitation of your righteousness. 
And your beginning has been small, || And your latter end is very great. 
For inquire, please, of a former generation, || And prepare for a search of their fathers, 
For we are of yesterday, and we do not know, || For our days are a shadow on earth. 
Do they not show you—speak to you, || And from their heart bring forth words? 
Does a rush rise without a marsh? A reed increase without water? 
While it is in its budding—uncropped, || Even before any herb it withers. 
So are the paths of all forgetting God, || And the hope of the profane perishes, 
Whose confidence is loathsome, || And the house of a spider his trust. 
He leans on his house—and it does not stand, || He takes hold on it—and it does not abide. 
He is green before the sun, || And over his garden his branch goes out. 
His roots are wrapped by a heap, || He looks for a house of stones. 
If one destroys him from his place, || Then it has feigned concerning him, || I have not seen you! 
Behold, this is the joy of His way, || And from the dust others spring up. 
Behold, God does not reject the perfect, || Nor takes hold on the hand of evildoers. 
While He fills your mouth with laughter, || And your lips with shouting, 
Those hating you put on shame, || And the tent of the wicked is not!”
