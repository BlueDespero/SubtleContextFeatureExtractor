Acts.
Chapter 28.
And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Malta, 
and the foreigners were showing us no ordinary kindness, for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the pressing rain, and because of the cold; 
but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and having laid them on the fire, a viper—having come out of the heat—fastened on his hand. 
And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice did not permit to live”; 
he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered no evil, 
and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or to suddenly fall down dead, and they, expecting it a long time, and seeing nothing uncommon happening to him, changing their minds, said he was a god. 
And in the neighborhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having received us, courteously lodged us for three days; 
and it came to pass, the father of Publius was lying, oppressed with fevers and dysentery, to whom Paul, having entered and having prayed, having laid his hands on him, healed him; 
this, therefore, being done, also the others in the island having sicknesses were coming and were healed; 
who also honored us with many honors, and we setting sail—they were loading us with the things that were necessary. 
And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had wintered in the island) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri, 
and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days, 
there having gone around, we came to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second day we came to Puteoli, 
where, having found brothers, we were called on to remain with them seven days, and thus we came to Rome; 
and there, the brothers having heard the things concerning us, came forth to meet us, as far as the Forum of Appius, and Three Taverns—whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to God, took courage. 
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the captain of the barracks, but Paul was permitted to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him. 
And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having come together, he said to them: “Men, brothers, I—having done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the fathers—a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up into the hands of the Romans; 
who having examined me, were willing to release me, because of their being no cause of death in me, 
and the Jews having spoken against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar—not as having anything to accuse my nation of; 
for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to speak with you, for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.” 
And they said to him, “We neither received letters concerning you from Judea, nor did anyone who came of the brothers declare or speak any evil concerning you, 
and we think it good from you to hear what you think, for indeed, concerning this sect it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere”; 
and having appointed him a day, more of them came to him, to the lodging, to whom he was setting it forth, testifying fully the Kingdom of God, persuading them also of the things concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, from morning until evening, 
and some, indeed, were believing the things spoken, and some were not believing. 
And not being agreed with one another, they were going away, Paul having spoken one word, “The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, 
saying, Go on to this people and say, With hearing you will hear, and you will not understand, and seeing you will see, and you will not perceive, 
for the heart of this people was made obtuse, and with the ears they barely heard, and they closed their eyes, lest they may see with the eyes, and may understand with the heart, and should turn, and I may heal them. 
Be it known, therefore, to you, that the salvation of God was sent to the nations, these also will hear it”; 
and he having said these things, the Jews went away, having much debate among themselves; 
and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired house, and was receiving all those coming in to him, 
preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness—unforbidden.
