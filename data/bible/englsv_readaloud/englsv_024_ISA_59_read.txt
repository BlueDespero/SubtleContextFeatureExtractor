Isaiah.
Chapter 59.
Behold, the hand of YHWH || Has not been shortened from saving, || Nor His ear heavy from hearing. 
But your iniquities have been separating || Between you and your God, || And your sins have hidden || The Presence from you—from hearing. 
For your hands have been defiled with blood, || And your fingers with iniquity, || Your lips have spoken falsehood, || Your tongue mutters perverseness. 
There is none calling in righteousness, || And there is none pleading in faithfulness, || Trusting on emptiness, and speaking falsehood, || Conceiving perverseness, and bearing iniquity. 
They have hatched eggs of a viper, || And weave webs of a spider, || Whoever is eating their eggs dies, and the crushed hatches a viper. 
Their webs do not become a garment, || Nor do they cover themselves with their works, || Their works are works of iniquity, || And a deed of violence is in their hands. 
Their feet run to evil, || And they hurry to shed innocent blood, || Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, || Spoiling and destruction are in their highways. 
They have not known a way of peace, || And there is no judgment in their paths, || They have made their paths perverse for themselves, || None treading in it has known peace. 
Therefore judgment has been far from us, || And righteousness does not reach us, || We wait for light, and behold, darkness, || For brightness—in thick darkness we go, 
We feel for the wall like the blind, || Indeed, we feel as without eyes, || We have stumbled at noon as at twilight, || In desolate places as the dead. 
We make a noise as bears—all of us, || And we coo severely as doves; We wait for judgment, and there is none, || For salvation—it has been far from us. 
For our transgressions have been multiplied before You, || And our sins have testified against us, || For our transgressions are with us, || And our iniquities—we have known them. 
Transgressing, and lying against YHWH, || And removing from after our God, || Speaking oppression and apostasy, || Conceiving and uttering from the heart || Words of falsehood. 
And judgment is removed backward, || And righteousness stands far off, || For truth has been feeble in the street, || And straightforwardness is not able to enter, 
And the truth is lacking, || And whoever is turning aside from evil, || Is making himself a spoil. And YHWH sees, and it is evil in His eyes, || That there is no judgment. 
And He sees that there is no man, || And is astonished that there is no intercessor, || And His own arm gives salvation to Him, || And His righteousness—it sustained Him. 
And He puts on righteousness as a breastplate, || And a helmet of salvation on His head, || And He puts on garments of vengeance for clothing, || And is covered, as with an upper-robe, with zeal. 
According to deeds—so He repays. Fury to His adversaries, their deed to His enemies, || To the islands He repays their deed. 
And from the west they fear the Name of YHWH, || And from the rising of the sun—His glory, || When an adversary comes in as a flood, || The Spirit of YHWH has raised an ensign against him. 
“And the Redeemer has come to Zion, || Even to captives of transgression in Jacob,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“And I—this is My covenant with them,” said YHWH, “My Spirit that is on you, || And My words that I have put in your mouth, || Do not depart from your mouth, || And from the mouth of your seed, || And from the mouth of your seed’s seed,” said YHWH, “From now on, even for all time!”
