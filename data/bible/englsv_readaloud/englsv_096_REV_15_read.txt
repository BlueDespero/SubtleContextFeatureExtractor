Revelation.
Chapter 15.
And I saw another sign in the sky, great and wonderful: seven messengers having the seven last plagues, because in these the wrath of God was completed, 
and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who gain the victory over the beast, and his image, and his mark, and the number of his name, standing by the sea of the glass, having harps of God, 
and they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and wonderful are Your works, O LORD God, the Almighty, righteous and true are Your ways, O King of holy ones! 
Who may not fear You, O LORD, and glorify Your Name? Because You alone are holy, because all the nations will come and worship before You, because Your righteous acts were revealed.” 
And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the Dwelling Place of the Testimony was opened in Heaven; 
and the seven messengers having the seven plagues came forth out of the temple, clothed in linen, pure and radiant, and girded around the breasts with golden girdles: 
and one of the four living creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden bowls, full of the wrath of God, who is living through the ages of the ages; 
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be completed.
