Isaiah.
Chapter 9.
For there will be no gloom on her who is distressed as at the former time. The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, || So the latter has honored the way of the sea, || Beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 
The people who are walking in darkness || Have seen a great light, || Dwellers in a land of death-shade, || Light has shone on them. 
You have multiplied the nation, || You have made its joy great, || They have rejoiced before You as the joy in harvest, || As men rejoice in their apportioning spoil. 
Because the yoke of its burden, || And the staff of its shoulder, the rod of its exactor, || You have broken as in the day of Midian. 
For every battle of a warrior is with rushing, and raiment rolled in blood, || And it has been for burning—fuel of fire. 
For a Child has been born to us, || A Son has been given to us, || And the dominion is on His shoulder, || And He calls His Name || Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, || Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. 
Of the increase of His dominion, || And of peace, there is no end, || On the throne of David, and on His kingdom, || To establish it, and to support it, || In judgment and in righteousness, || From now on, even for all time, || The zeal of YHWH of Hosts does this. 
The Lord has sent a word into Jacob, || And it has fallen in Israel. 
And the people have known—all of it, Ephraim, and the inhabitant of Samaria, || In pride and in greatness of heart, saying, 
“Bricks have fallen, and we build hewn work, || Sycamores have been cut down, and we renew cedars.” 
And YHWH sets the adversaries of Rezin on high above him, || And he joins his enemies together, 
Aram from before, and Philistia from behind, || And they devour Israel with the whole mouth. With all this His anger has not turned back, || And His hand is still stretched out. 
And the people has not turned back to Him who is striking it, || And they have not sought YHWH of Hosts. 
And YHWH cuts off head and tail from Israel, || Branch and reed—the same day. 
Elderly and accepted of faces—he is the head, || And prophet teaching falsehood—he is the tail. 
And the eulogists of this people are causing to err, || And its eulogized ones are consumed. 
Therefore, the Lord does not rejoice over its young men, || And He does not pity its orphans and its widows, || For everyone is profane, and an evildoer, || And every mouth is speaking folly. With all this His anger has not turned back, || And His hand is still stretched out. 
For wickedness has burned as a fire, || It devours brier and thorn, || And it kindles in thickets of the forest, || And they lift themselves up, an exaltation of smoke! 
In the wrath of YHWH of Hosts || The land has been consumed, || And the people is as fuel of fire; A man has no pity on his brother, 
And cuts down on the right, and has been hungry, || And he devours on the left, || And they have not been satisfied, || They each devour the flesh of his own arm. 
Manasseh—Ephraim, and Ephraim—Manasseh, || Together they are against Judah, || With all this His anger has not turned back. And His hand is still stretched out!
