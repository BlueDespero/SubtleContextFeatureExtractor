Proverbs.
Chapter 20.
Wine is a scorner—strong drink is noisy, || And any going astray in it is not wise. 
The fear of a king is a growl as of a young lion, || He who is causing him to be angry is wronging his soul. 
Cessation from strife is an honor to a man, || And every fool interferes. 
The slothful does not plow because of winter, || He asks in harvest, and there is nothing. 
Counsel in the heart of a man is deep water, || And a man of understanding draws it up. 
A multitude of men each proclaim his kindness, || And a man of steadfastness who finds? 
The righteous is habitually walking in his integrity, || O the blessedness of his sons after him! 
A king sitting on a throne of judgment, || Is scattering all evil with his eyes, 
Who says, “I have purified my heart, || I have been cleansed from my sin?” 
A stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah, || Even both of them are an abomination to YHWH. 
Even by his actions a youth makes himself known, || Whether his work is pure or upright. 
A hearing ear, and a seeing eye—YHWH has even made both of them. 
Do not love sleep, lest you become poor, || Open your eyes—be satisfied with bread. 
“Bad, bad,” says the buyer, || And then he boasts himself going his way. 
Substance, gold, and a multitude of rubies, || Indeed, a precious vessel, are lips of knowledge. 
When a stranger has been guarantor, take his garment, || And pledge it for strangers. 
The bread of falsehood is sweet to a man, || And afterward his mouth is filled with gravel. 
You establish purposes by counsel, || And with plans you make war. 
The busybody is a revealer of secret counsels, || And do not make yourself guarantor for a deceiver with his lips. 
Whoever is vilifying his father and his mother, his lamp is extinguished in blackness of darkness. 
An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, || Even its latter end is not blessed. 
Do not say, “I repay evil,” || Wait for YHWH, and He delivers you. 
A stone and a stone are an abomination to YHWH, || And balances of deceit are not good. 
The steps of a man are from YHWH, || And man—how does he understand his way? 
A snare to a man that he has swallowed a holy thing, || And to make inquiry after vows. 
A wise king is scattering the wicked, || And turns the wheel back on them. 
The breath of man is a lamp of YHWH, || Searching all the inner parts of the heart. 
Kindness and truth keep a king, || And he has supported his throne by kindness. 
The beauty of young men is their strength, || And the honor of old men is grey hairs. 
Blows that wound cleanse away evil, || Also the scourges of the inner parts of the heart!
