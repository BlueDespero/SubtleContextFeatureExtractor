The Book of Hosea.
Chapter 1.
A word of YHWH that has been to Hosea, son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel: 
The commencement of YHWH’s speaking by Hosea. And YHWH says to Hosea, “Go, take a woman of whoredoms for yourself, and children of whoredoms, for the land goes utterly whoring from after YHWH.” 
And he goes and takes Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceives and bears a son to him; 
and YHWH says to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little, and I have charged the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and have caused the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease; 
and it has come to pass in that day that I have broken the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.” 
And she conceives again, and bears a daughter, and He says to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah (Not Loved), for I no longer pity the house of Israel, for I utterly take them away; 
and I pity the house of Judah, and have saved them by their God YHWH, and do not save them by bow, and by sword, and by battle, by horses, and by horsemen.” 
And she weans Lo-Ruhamah, and conceives, and bears a son; 
and He says, “Call his name Lo-Ammi (Not My People), for you are not My people, and I am not for you; 
and the number of the sons of Israel has been as the sand of the sea that is not measured nor numbered, and it has come to pass in the place where it is said to them, You are not My people, it is said to them, Sons of the Living God; 
and the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel have been gathered together, and they have appointed one head for themselves, and have gone up from the land, for great is the day of Jezreel.”
