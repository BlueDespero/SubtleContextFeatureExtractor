Psalms.
Chapter 87.
A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. A SONG. His foundation is in holy mountains. 
YHWH is loving the gates of Zion || Above all the dwelling places of Jacob. 
Honorable things are spoken in You, || O city of God. Selah. 
I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, || Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This one was born there. 
And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, || And He, the Most High, establishes her. 
YHWH recounts in the describing of the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah. 
Also singers as players on instruments, || All my fountains are in You!
