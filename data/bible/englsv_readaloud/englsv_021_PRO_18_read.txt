Proverbs.
Chapter 18.
He who is separated seeks his own desire, || He interferes with all wisdom. 
A fool does not delight in understanding, || But in uncovering his heart. 
Contempt has also come with the coming of the wicked, || And with shame—reproach. 
The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters, || The fountain of wisdom is a flowing brook. 
Favoring of the face of the wicked is not good, || To turn aside the righteous in judgment. 
The lips of a fool enter into strife, || And his mouth calls for stripes. 
The mouth of a fool is ruin to him, || And his lips are the snare of his soul. 
The words of a tale-bearer are as self-inflicted wounds, || And they have gone down to the inner parts of the heart. 
He also that is remiss in his work, || He is a brother to a destroyer. 
The Name of YHWH is a tower of strength, || The righteous runs into it, and is set on high. 
The wealth of the rich is the city of his strength, || And as a wall set on high in his own imagination. 
The heart of man is high before destruction, || And humility is before honor. 
Whoever is answering a matter before he hears, || It is folly to him—and shame. 
The spirit of a man sustains his sickness, || And who bears a struck spirit? 
The heart of the intelligent gets knowledge, || And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 
The gift of a man makes room for him, || And it leads him before the great. 
The first in his own cause seems righteous, || But his neighbor comes and has searched him. 
The lot causes contentions to cease, || And it separates between the mighty. 
A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, || And contentions as the bar of a palace. 
From the fruit of a man’s mouth is his belly satisfied, || From the increase of his lips he is satisfied. 
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, || And those loving it eat its fruit. 
Whoever has found a wife has found good, || And brings out goodwill from YHWH. 
The poor speaks with supplications, || And the rich answers fierce things. 
A man with friends—to show himself friendly, || And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
