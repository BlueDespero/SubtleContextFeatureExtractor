Psalms.
Chapter 19.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. The heavens are recounting the glory of God, || And the expanse is declaring the work of His hands. 
Day to day utters speech, || And night to night shows knowledge. 
There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice has not been heard. 
Their line has gone forth into all the earth, || And their sayings to the end of the world, || In them He placed a tent for the sun, 
And he, as a bridegroom, goes out from his covering, || He rejoices as a mighty one || To run the path. 
From the end of the heavens is his going out, || And his revolution is to their ends, || And nothing is hid from his heat. 
The law of YHWH is perfect, refreshing the soul, || The testimonies of YHWH are steadfast, || Making the simple wise, 
The precepts of YHWH are upright, || Rejoicing the heart, || The command of YHWH is pure, enlightening the eyes, 
The fear of YHWH is clean, standing for all time, || The judgments of YHWH are true, || They have been righteous—together. 
They are more desirable than gold, || Indeed, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, || Even liquid honey of the comb. 
Also—Your servant is warned by them, “In keeping them is a great reward.” 
His errors—who understands? Declare me innocent from hidden ones, 
Also—keep back Your servant from presumptuous ones, || Do not let them rule over me, || Then I am perfect, || And declared innocent of much transgression. 
Let the sayings of my mouth, || And the meditation of my heart, || Be for a pleasing thing before You, O YHWH, my rock, and my redeemer!
