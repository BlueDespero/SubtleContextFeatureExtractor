Zechariah.
Chapter 13.
“In that day there is a fountain opened || To the house of David || And to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, || For sin and for impurity. 
And it has come to pass in that day,” || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || “I cut off the names of the idols from the land, || And they are not remembered anymore, || And also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness || I cause to pass away from the land. 
And it has been, when one prophesies again, || That his parents, his father and his mother, || Have said to him, You do not live, || For you have spoken falsehood in the Name of YHWH, || And his father and his mother, his parents, || Have pierced him through in his prophesying. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || The prophets are ashamed, each of his vision, in his prophesying, || And they do not put on a hairy robe to deceive. 
And one has said, I am not a prophet, || A man—I am a tiller of ground, || For ground is my possession from my youth. 
And one has said to him, || What are these wounds in your hands? And he has said, Because I was struck at home by my lovers. 
Sword, awake against My Shepherd, || And against a hero—My Fellow,” || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts. “Strike the Shepherd, and the flock is scattered, || And I have put back My hand on the little ones. 
And it has come to pass, || In all the land,” a declaration of YHWH, || “Two parts in it are cut off—they expire, || And the third is left in it. 
And I have brought the third into fire, || And refined them like a refining of silver, || And have tried them like a trying of gold, || It calls in My Name, and I answer it, || I have said, It is My people, || And it says, YHWH is my God!”
