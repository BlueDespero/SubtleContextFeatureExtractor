Psalms.
Chapter 33.
Sing, you righteous, in YHWH, || For praise from upright ones is lovely. 
Give thanks to YHWH with a harp, || With stringed instrument of ten strings sing praise to Him, 
Sing to Him a new song, || Play skillfully with shouting. 
For the word of YHWH is upright, || And all His work is in faithfulness. 
Loving righteousness and judgment, || The earth is full of the kindness of YHWH. 
By the word of YHWH || The heavens have been made, || And all their host by the breath of His mouth. 
Gathering the waters of the sea as a heap, || Putting the depths in treasuries. 
All the earth is afraid of YHWH, || All the inhabitants of the world are afraid of Him. 
For He has spoken, and it is, || He has commanded, and it stands. 
YHWH made void the counsel of nations, || He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples. 
The counsel of YHWH stands for all time, || The thoughts of His heart from generation to generation. 
O the blessedness of the nation whose God is YHWH, || Of the people He chose, || For an inheritance to Him. 
YHWH has looked from the heavens, || He has seen all the sons of men. 
From the fixed place of His dwelling, || He looked to all inhabitants of the earth; 
Who is forming their hearts together, || Who is attending to all their works. 
The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, || By abundance of power. 
A false thing is the horse for safety, || And he does not deliver || By the abundance of his strength. 
Behold, the eye of YHWH is to those fearing Him, || To those waiting for His kindness, 
To deliver their soul from death, || And to keep them alive in famine. 
Our soul has waited for YHWH, || He is our help and our shield, 
For our heart rejoices in Him, || For we have trusted in His Holy Name. 
Let Your kindness, O YHWH, be on us, || As we have waited for You!
