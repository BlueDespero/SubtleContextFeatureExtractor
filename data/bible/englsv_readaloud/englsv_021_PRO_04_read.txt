Proverbs.
Chapter 4.
Hear, you sons, the instruction of a father, || And give attention to know understanding. 
For I have given to you good learning, do not forsake my law. 
For I have been a son to my father—tender, || And an only one before my mother. 
And he directs me, and he says to me: “Let your heart retain my words, || Keep my commands, and live. 
Get wisdom, get understanding, || Do not forget, nor turn away || From the sayings of my mouth. 
Do not forsake her, and she preserves you, || Love her, and she keeps you. 
The first thing is wisdom—get wisdom, || And with all your getting get understanding. 
Exalt her and she lifts you up, || She honors you when you embrace her. 
She gives a wreath of grace to your head, || She gives you a crown of beauty freely.” 
Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, || And years of life are multiplied to you. 
I have directed you in a way of wisdom, || I have caused you to tread in paths of uprightness. 
In your walking your step is not restricted, || And if you run, you do not stumble. 
Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, || Keep her, for she is your life. 
Do not enter into the path of the wicked, || And do not be blessed in a way of evildoers. 
Avoid it, do not pass over into it, || Turn aside from it, and pass on. 
For they do not sleep if they do no evil, || And their sleep has been taken away violently, || If they do not cause some to stumble. 
For they have eaten bread of wickedness, || And they drink wine of violence. 
And the path of the righteous is as a shining light, || Going and brightening until the day is established, 
The way of the wicked is as darkness, || They have not known at what they stumble. 
My son, give attention to my words, || Incline your ear to my sayings, 
Do not let them turn aside from your eyes, || Preserve them in the midst of your heart. 
For they are life to those finding them, || And healing to all their flesh. 
Above every charge keep your heart, || For out of it are the outgoings of life. 
Turn aside a contrary mouth from you, || And put perverse lips far from you, 
Your eyes look straightforward, || And your eyelids look straight before you. 
Ponder the path of your feet, || And all your ways are established. 
Do not incline to the right or to the left, || Turn aside your foot from evil!
