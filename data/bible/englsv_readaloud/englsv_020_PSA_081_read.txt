Psalms.
Chapter 81.
TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE GITTITH. BY ASAPH. Cry aloud to God our strength, || Shout to the God of Jacob. 
Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, || A pleasant harp with stringed instrument. 
Blow a horn in the month, || In the new moon, at the day of our festival, 
For it is a statute to Israel, || An ordinance of the God of Jacob. 
He has placed it—a testimony on Joseph, || In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known—I hear. 
I turned aside his shoulder from the burden, || His hands pass over from the basket. 
In distress you have called and I deliver you, || I answer you in the secret place of thunder, || I try you by the waters of Meribah. Selah. 
Hear, O My people, and I testify to you, || O Israel, if you listen to me: 
There is not in you a strange god, || And you do not bow yourself to a strange god. 
I am your God YHWH, || Who brings you up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge your mouth, and I fill it. 
But My people did not listen to My voice, || And Israel has not consented to Me. 
And I send them away in the enmity of their heart, || They walk in their own counsels. 
O that My people were listening to Me, || Israel would walk in My ways. 
As a little thing I cause their enemies to bow, || And I turn back My hand against their adversaries, 
Those hating YHWH should have feigned obedience to Him, || And their time would last for all time. 
He causes him to eat of the fat of wheat, || And I satisfy you with honey from a rock!
