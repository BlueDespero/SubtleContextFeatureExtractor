Psalms.
Chapter 63.
A PSALM OF DAVID, IN HIS BEING IN THE WILDERNESS OF JUDAH. O God, You are my God, earnestly I seek You, || My soul has thirsted for You, || My flesh has longed for You, || In a dry and weary land, without waters. 
So I have seen You in the sanctuary, || To behold Your strength and Your glory. 
Because better is Your kindness than life, || My lips praise You. 
So I bless You in my life, || I lift up my hands in Your Name. 
As with milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, || And with singing lips my mouth praises. 
If I have remembered You on my bed, || I meditate on You in the watches. 
For You have been a help to me, || And I sing in the shadow of Your wings. 
My soul has cleaved after You, || Your right hand has taken hold on me. 
And they who seek my soul for desolation, || Go into the lower parts of the earth. 
They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, || They are a portion for foxes. 
And the king rejoices in God, || Everyone swearing by Him boasts, || But the mouth of those speaking lies is stopped!
