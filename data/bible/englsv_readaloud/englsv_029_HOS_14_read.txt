Hosea.
Chapter 14.
“Turn back, O Israel, to your God YHWH, || For you have stumbled by your iniquity. 
Take words with you, and turn to YHWH, || Say to Him, Take away all iniquity, and give good, || And we render the fruit of our lips. 
Asshur does not save us, we do not ride on a horse, || Nor do we say anymore, Our god, to the work of our hands, || For in You the fatherless find mercy. 
I heal their backsliding, I love them freely, || For My anger has turned back from him. 
I am as dew to Israel, he flourishes as a lily, || And he strikes forth his roots as Lebanon. 
His shoots go on, || And his splendor is as an olive, || And he has fragrance as Lebanon. 
The dwellers return under his shadow, || They revive as grain, and flourish as a vine, || His memorial is as wine of Lebanon. 
O Ephraim, what have I anymore to do with idols? I have answered, and I look after him: I am as a green fir-tree, || Your fruit is found from Me. 
Who is wise, and understands these? Prudent, and knows them? For upright are the ways of YHWH, || And the righteous go on in them, || And the transgressors stumble therein!”
