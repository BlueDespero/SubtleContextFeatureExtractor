Psalms.
Chapter 90.
A PRAYER OF MOSES, THE MAN OF GOD. Lord, You have been a habitation, || To us—in generation and generation, 
Before mountains were brought forth, || And You form the earth and the world, || Even from age to age You are God. 
You turn man to a bruised thing, || And say, Return, you sons of men. 
For one thousand years in Your eyes are as yesterday, || For it passes on, indeed, as a watch by night. 
You have inundated them, they are asleep, || In the morning he changes as grass. 
In the morning it flourishes, and has changed, || At evening it is cut down, and has withered. 
For we were consumed in Your anger, || And we have been troubled in Your fury. 
You have set our iniquities before You, || Our hidden things at the light of Your face, 
For all our days pined away in Your wrath, || We consumed our years as a meditation. 
The days of our years, in them are seventy years, || And if, by reason of might, eighty years, || Yet their enlargement is labor and vanity, || For it has been cut off quickly, and we fly away. 
Who knows the power of Your anger? And according to Your fear—Your wrath? 
Let us know to number our days correctly, || And we bring the heart to wisdom. 
Turn back, O YHWH, until when? And regret concerning Your servants. 
Satisfy us at morning with Your kindness, || And we sing and rejoice all our days. 
Cause us to rejoice according to the days || Wherein You have afflicted us, || The years we have seen evil. 
Let Your work appear to Your servants, || And Your honor on their sons. 
And let the pleasantness of our God YHWH be on us, || And establish on us the work of our hands, || Indeed, establish the work of our hands!
