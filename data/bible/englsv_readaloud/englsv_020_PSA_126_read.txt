Psalms.
Chapter 126.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. In YHWH’s turning back to the captivity of Zion, || We have been as dreamers. 
Then our mouth is filled with laughter, || And our tongue with singing, || Then they say among nations, “YHWH did great things with these.” 
YHWH did great things with us, || We have been joyful. 
Turn again, O YHWH, to our captivity, || As streams in the south. 
Those sowing in tears, reap with singing, 
Whoever goes on and weeps, || Carrying the basket of seed, || Surely comes in with singing, carrying his sheaves!
