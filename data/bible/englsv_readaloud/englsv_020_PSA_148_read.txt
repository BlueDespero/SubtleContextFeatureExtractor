Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Praise YAH! Praise YHWH from the heavens, || Praise Him in high places. 
Praise Him, all His messengers, || Praise Him, all His hosts. 
Praise Him, sun and moon, || Praise Him, all stars of light. 
Praise Him, heavens of heavens, || And you waters that are above the heavens. 
They praise the Name of YHWH, || For He commanded, and they were created. 
And He establishes them forever and for all time, || He gave a statute, and they do not pass over. 
Praise YHWH from the earth, || Dragons and all deeps, 
Fire and hail, snow and vapor, || Whirlwind doing His word; 
The mountains and all heights, || Fruit tree, and all cedars, 
The wild beast, and all livestock, || Creeping thing, and winged bird, 
Kings of earth, and all peoples, || Chiefs, and all judges of earth, 
Young men, and also maidens, || Aged men, with youths, 
They praise the Name of YHWH, || For His Name alone has been set on high, || His splendor is above earth and heavens. 
And He exalts the horn of His people, || The praise of all His saints, || Of the sons of Israel, || A people near Him. Praise YAH!
