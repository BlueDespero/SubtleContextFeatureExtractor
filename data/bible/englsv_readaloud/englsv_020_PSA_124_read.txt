Psalms.
Chapter 124.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. If YHWH had not been for us || (Pray, let Israel say), 
If YHWH had not been for us, || In the rising up of man against us, 
Then they had swallowed us alive, || In the burning of their anger against us, 
Then the waters had overflowed us, || The stream passed over our soul, 
Then proud waters had passed over our soul. 
Blessed is YHWH who has not given us, || As prey to their teeth. 
Our soul has escaped as a bird from a snare of fowlers, || The snare was broken, and we have escaped. 
Our help is in the Name of YHWH, || Maker of the heavens and earth!
