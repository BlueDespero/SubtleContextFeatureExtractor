Psalms.
Chapter 4.
TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM OF DAVID. In my calling answer me, || O God of my righteousness. In adversity You gave enlargement to me; Favor me, and hear my prayer. 
Sons of men! Until when is my glory for shame? You love a vain thing, you seek a lie. Selah. 
And know that YHWH || Has separated a saintly one to Himself. YHWH hears in my calling to Him. 
“Tremble, and do not sin”; Say thus in your heart on your bed, || And be silent. Selah. 
Sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness, || And trust in YHWH. 
Many are saying, “Who shows us good?” Lift on us the light of Your face, O YHWH, 
You have given joy in my heart, || From the time their grain and their wine || Have been multiplied. 
Together I lie down and sleep in peace, || For You, O YHWH, alone, || Cause me to dwell in confidence!
