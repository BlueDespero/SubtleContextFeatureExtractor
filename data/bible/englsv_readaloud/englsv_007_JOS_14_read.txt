Joshua.
Chapter 14.
And these are they of the sons of Israel who inherited in the land of Canaan, whom Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel, caused to inherit; 
their inheritance is by lot, as YHWH commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe; 
for Moses has given the inheritance of two of the tribes, and of half of the tribe, beyond the Jordan, and he has not given an inheritance to the Levites in their midst; 
for the sons of Joseph have been two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they have not given a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, and their outskirts for their livestock, and for their possessions; 
as YHWH commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel have done, and they apportion the land. 
And the sons of Judah come near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite says to him, “You have known the word that YHWH has spoken to Moses, the man of God, concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh-Barnea: 
I was a son of forty years in Moses, servant of YHWH, sending me from Kadesh-Barnea, to spy out the land, and I bring him back word as with my heart; 
and my brothers who have gone up with me have caused the heart of the people to melt, and I have been fully after my God YHWH; 
and Moses swears in that day, saying, Nevertheless—the land on which your foot has trodden, it is to you for an inheritance, and to your sons—for all time, for you have been fully after my God YHWH. 
And now, behold, YHWH has kept me alive, as He has spoken, these forty-five years, since YHWH spoke this word to Moses when Israel went in the wilderness; and now, behold, I am a son of eighty-five years today; 
yet today I am strong as in the day of Moses’ sending me; as my power was then, so is my power now, for battle, and to go out, and to come in. 
And now, give this hill-country to me, of which YHWH spoke in that day, for you heard in that day, for Anakim are there, and great, fortified cities; if it so be that YHWH is with me, then I have dispossessed them, as YHWH has spoken.” 
And Joshua blesses him, and gives Hebron to Caleb son of Jephunneh for an inheritance, 
therefore Hebron has been to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenezzite for an inheritance to this day, because that he was fully after YHWH, God of Israel; 
and the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath-Arba (the man was the greatest among the Anakim); and the land has rest from war.
