Isaiah.
Chapter 55.
“Behold, every thirsty one, || Come to the waters, || And he who has no money, || Come, buy and eat, || Indeed, come, buy wine and milk || Without money and without price. 
Why do you weigh money for that which is not bread? And your labor for that which is not for satiety? Listen diligently to Me, and eat good, || And your soul delights itself in fatness. 
Incline your ear, and come to Me, || Hear, and your soul lives, || And I make a perpetual covenant for you, || The kind blessings of David that are steadfast. 
Behold, I have given him as a witness to peoples, || A leader and commander to peoples. 
Behold, a nation you do not know, you call, || And a nation who does not know you runs to you, || For the sake of your God YHWH, || And for the Holy One of Israel, || Because He has beautified you.” 
Seek YHWH while He may be found, || Call Him while He is near, 
Let the wicked forsake his way, || And the man of iniquity his thoughts, || And he returns to YHWH, || And He pities him, || And to our God, || For He multiplies to pardon. 
“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, || Nor your ways My ways,” || A declaration of YHWH, 
“For as high as the heavens have been above the earth, || So high have been My ways above your ways, || And My thoughts above your thoughts. 
For as the shower comes down, || And the snow from the heavens, || And does not return there, || But has watered the earth, || And has caused it to yield, and to spring up, || And has given seed to the sower, and bread to the eater, 
So is My word that goes out of My mouth, || It does not return to Me empty, || But has done that which I desired, || And prosperously effected that for which I sent it. 
For you go forth with joy, || And you are brought in with peace, || The mountains and the hills || Break forth before you with singing, || And all trees of the field clap the hand. 
Instead of the thorn comes up fir, || Instead of the brier comes up myrtle, || And it has been to YHWH for a name, || For a perpetual sign—it is not cut off!”
