Psalms.
Chapter 21.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, the king is joyful in Your strength, || How greatly he rejoices in Your salvation. 
You gave the desire of his heart to him, || And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah. 
For You put blessings of goodness before him, || You set a crown of fine gold on his head. 
He has asked for life from You, || You have given length of days to him, || For all time and forever. 
Great is his glory in Your salvation, || You place splendor and majesty on him. 
For You make him blessings forever, || You cause him to rejoice with joy, || By Your countenance. 
For the king is trusting in YHWH, || And in the kindness of the Most High he is not moved. 
Your hand comes to all Your enemies, || Your right hand finds Your haters. 
You make them as a furnace of fire, || At the time of Your presence. YHWH swallows them in His anger, || And fire devours them. 
You destroy their fruit from earth, || And their seed from the sons of men. 
For they stretched out evil against You, || They devised a wicked scheme, they do not prevail, 
For You make them turn their back, || When You prepare Your strings against their faces. 
Be exalted, O YHWH, in Your strength, || We sing and we praise Your might!
