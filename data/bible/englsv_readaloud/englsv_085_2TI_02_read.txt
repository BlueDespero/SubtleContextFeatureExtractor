2 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 
and the things that you heard from me through many witnesses, be committing these things to steadfast men, who will also be sufficient to teach others; 
you, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ; 
no one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who enlisted him; 
and if anyone also may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully; 
it is first necessary for the laboring farmer to partake of the fruits; 
be considering what things I say, for the LORD gives to you understanding in all things. 
Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news, 
in which I suffer evil—to bonds, as an evildoer, but the word of God has not been bound; 
because of this I endure all things, because of the chosen ones, that they also may obtain salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with perpetual glory. 
The word is steadfast: For if we died together—we will also live together; 
if we endure together—we will also reign together; if we deny Him, He will also deny us; 
if we are not steadfast, He remains steadfast; He is not able to deny Himself. 
Remind them of these things, testifying fully before the LORD—not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing; 
be diligent to present yourself approved to God—a workman not ashamed, straightly cutting the word of truth; 
and stand aloof from the profane vain talkings, for they will advance to more impiety, 
and their word will have pasture as a gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
who swerved concerning the truth, saying the resurrection to have already been, and overthrows the faith of some; 
sure, nevertheless, the foundation of God has stood, having this seal: “The LORD has known those who are His,” and, “Let him depart from unrighteousness—everyone who is naming the Name of Christ.” 
And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor, and some to dishonor: 
if, then, anyone may cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified and profitable to the master—having been prepared to every good work; 
and flee the youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling on the LORD out of a pure heart; 
and be avoiding the foolish and uninstructed questions, having known that they beget strife, 
and a servant of the LORD must not quarrel, but to be gentle to all, apt to teach, patient under evil, 
instructing those opposing in meekness—if perhaps God may give to them conversion to an acknowledging of the truth, 
and they may awake out of the Devil’s snare, having been caught by him at his will.
