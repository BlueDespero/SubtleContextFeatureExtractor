The Book of Nahum.
Chapter 1.
Burden of Nineveh. The Scroll of the Vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
A God zealous and avenging is YHWH, || An avenger is YHWH, and possessing fury. An avenger is YHWH on His adversaries, || And He is watching for His enemies. 
YHWH is slow to anger, and great in power, || And YHWH does not entirely acquit, || In a windstorm and in a storm is His way, || And a cloud is the dust of His feet. 
He is pushing against a sea, and dries it up, || Indeed, He has made all the floods dry, || Bashan and Carmel are languishing, || Indeed, the flower of Lebanon is languishing. 
Mountains have shaken because of Him, || And the hills have been melted; And the earth is lifted up at His presence, || And the world and all dwelling in it. 
Who stands before His indignation? And who rises up in the heat of His anger? His fury has been poured out like fire, || And the rocks have been broken by Him. 
Good is YHWH for a strong place in a day of distress. And He knows those trusting in Him. 
And with a flood passing over, || An end He makes of its place, || And darkness pursues His enemies. 
What do we devise against YHWH? He is making an end, distress does not arise twice. 
For while princes are perplexed, || And with their drink are drunken, || They have been consumed as stubble fully dried. 
From you has come forth a deviser of evil || Against YHWH—a worthless counselor. 
Thus said YHWH: “Though complete, and thus many, || Yet thus they have been cut off, || And he has passed away. Though I afflicted you, I afflict you no longer. 
And now I break his rod from off you, || And your bands I draw away.” 
And YHWH has commanded concerning you, || “No more of your name spreads abroad, || I cut off carved and molten image from the house of your gods, || I appoint your grave, for you have been vile.” 
Behold, on the mountains the feet of one proclaiming tidings, sounding peace! Celebrate, O Judah, your festivals, complete your vows, || For the worthless no longer pass over into you, || He has been completely cut off!
