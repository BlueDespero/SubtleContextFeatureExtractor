Psalms.
Chapter 108.
A SONG. A PSALM OF DAVID. My heart is prepared, O God, || I sing, indeed, I sing praise, also my glory. 
Awake, stringed instrument and harp, || I awake the dawn. 
I thank You among peoples, O YHWH, || And I praise You among the nations. 
For Your kindness is great above the heavens, || And Your truth to the clouds. 
Be exalted above the heavens, O God, || And Your glory above all the earth. 
That Your beloved ones may be delivered, || Save with Your right hand, and answer us. 
God has spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, || And I measure the Valley of Succoth, 
Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine, || And Ephraim is the strength of My head, || Judah is My lawgiver, 
Moab is a pot for My washing, || On Edom I cast My shoe, || Over Philistia I habitually shout. 
Who brings me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom? 
Have You not, O God, cast us off? And You do not go out, O God, with our hosts! 
Give to us help from adversity, || And the salvation of man is vain. 
We do mightily in God, || And He treads down our adversaries!
