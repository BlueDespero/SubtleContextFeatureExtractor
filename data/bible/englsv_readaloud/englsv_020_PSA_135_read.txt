Psalms.
Chapter 135.
Praise YAH! Praise the Name of YHWH, || Praise, you servants of YHWH, 
Who are standing in the house of YHWH, || In the courts of the house of our God. 
Praise YAH! For YHWH is good, || Sing praise to His Name, for it is pleasant. 
For YAH has chosen Jacob for Himself, || Israel for His peculiar treasure. 
For I have known that YHWH is great, || Indeed, our Lord is above all gods. 
All that YHWH pleased He has done, || In the heavens and in earth, || In the seas and all deep places, 
Causing vapors to ascend from the end of the earth, || He has made lightnings for the rain, || Bringing forth wind from His treasures. 
Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, || From man to beast. 
He sent tokens and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, || On Pharaoh and on all his servants. 
Who struck many nations, and slew strong kings, 
Even Sihon king of the Amorite, || And Og king of Bashan, || And all kingdoms of Canaan. 
And He gave their land an inheritance, || An inheritance to His people Israel, 
O YHWH, Your Name is for all time, || O YHWH, Your memorial from generation to generation. 
For YHWH judges His people, || And comforts Himself for His servants. 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, || Work of the hands of man. 
They have a mouth, and they do not speak, || They have eyes, and they do not see, 
They have ears, and they do not give ear, || Nose—there is no breath in their mouth! 
Their makers are like them, || Everyone who is trusting in them. 
O house of Israel, bless YHWH, || O house of Aaron, bless YHWH, 
O house of Levi, bless YHWH, || Those fearing YHWH, bless YHWH. 
Blessed is YHWH from Zion, || Inhabiting Jerusalem—praise YAH!
