Job.
Chapter 36.
And Elihu adds and says: 
“Honor me a little, and I show you, || That yet for God are words. 
I lift up my knowledge from afar, || And I ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
For my words are truly not false, || The perfect in knowledge is with you. 
Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise, || Mighty in power and heart. 
He does not revive the wicked, || And appoints the judgment of the poor; 
He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous, || And from kings on the throne, || And causes them to sit forever, and they are high, 
And if prisoners in chains || They are captured with cords of affliction, 
Then He declares to them their work, || And their transgressions, || Because they have become mighty, 
And He uncovers their ear for instruction, || And commands that they turn back from iniquity. 
If they hear and serve, || They complete their days in good, || And their years in pleasantness. 
And if they do not listen, || They pass away by the dart, || And expire without knowledge. 
And the profane in heart set the face, || They do not cry when He has bound them. 
Their soul dies in youth, || And their life among the defiled. 
He draws out the afflicted in his affliction, || And uncovers their ear in oppression. 
And He also moved you from a narrow place || To a broad place—no constriction under it, || And the sitting beyond of your table has been full of fatness. 
And you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked, || Judgment and justice are upheld because of fury, 
Lest He move you with a stroke, || And the abundance of an atonement not turn you aside. 
Does He value your riches? He has gold, and all the forces of power. 
Do not desire the night, || For the going up of peoples in their stead. 
Take heed—do not turn to iniquity, || For you have fixed on this || Rather than on affliction. 
Behold, God sits on high by His power, || Who is like Him—a teacher? 
Who has appointed to Him His way? And who said, You have done iniquity? 
Remember that you magnify His work || That men have beheld. 
All men have looked on it, || Man looks attentively from afar. 
Behold, God is high, || And we do not know the number of His years, || Indeed, there is no searching. 
When He diminishes droppings of the waters, || They refine rain according to its vapor, 
Which clouds drop, || They distill on man abundantly. 
Indeed, do any understand || The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His dwelling place? 
Behold, He has spread His light over it, || And He has covered the roots of the sea, 
For He judges peoples by them, || He gives food in abundance. 
By two palms He has covered the light, || And lays a charge over it in meeting, 
His shout shows it, || The livestock also, the rising storm.”
