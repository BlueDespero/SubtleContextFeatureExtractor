Psalms.
Chapter 20.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH answers you, || In a day of adversity, || The Name of the God of Jacob sets you on high, 
He sends your help from the sanctuary, || And supports you from Zion, 
He remembers all your presents, || And reduces your burnt-offering to ashes. Selah. 
He gives to you according to your heart, || And fulfills all your counsel. 
We sing of Your salvation, || And in the Name of our God set up a banner. YHWH fulfills all your requests. 
Now I have known || That YHWH has saved His anointed, || He answers him from His holy heavens, || With the saving might of His right hand. 
Some of chariots, and some of horses, || And we of the Name of our God YHWH || Make mention. 
They have bowed and have fallen, || And we have risen and station ourselves upright. 
O YHWH, save the king, || He answers us in the day we call!
