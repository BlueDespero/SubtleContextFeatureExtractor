Jeremiah.
Chapter 25.
The word that has been to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah—it is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon— 
Which Jeremiah the prophet has spoken concerning all the people of Judah, even to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, and to this day—this twenty-third year—the word of YHWH has been to me, and I speak to you, rising early and speaking, and you have not listened; 
and YHWH has sent all His servants to you, the prophets, rising early and sending, and you have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear, saying, 
Please turn back, each from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell on the ground that YHWH has given to you and to your fathers from age to age, 
and you do not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow yourselves to them, nor do you provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I do no evil to you; 
and you have not listened to Me,” a declaration of YHWH, “so as to provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands for evil to you. 
Therefore, thus said YHWH of Hosts: Because that you have not obeyed My words, 
behold, I am sending, and have taken all the families of the north—a declaration of YHWH—even to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and have brought them in against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations, and have devoted them, and appointed them for an astonishment, and for a hissing, and for continuous ruins. 
And I have destroyed from them the voice of rejoicing, and the voice of joy, voice of bridegroom and voice of bride, noise of millstones, and the light of lamps. 
And all this land has been for a desolation, for an astonishment, and these nations have served the king of Babylon seventy years. 
And it has come to pass, at the fullness of seventy years, I charge against the king of Babylon, and against that nation,” a declaration of YHWH, “their iniquity, and against the land of the Chaldeans, and have appointed it for continuous desolations. 
And I have brought in on that land all My words that I have spoken against it, all that is written in this scroll, that Jeremiah has prophesied concerning all the nations. 
For laid service on them—also them—have many nations and great kings, and I have given repayment to them according to their doing, and according to the work of their hands.” 
For thus said YHWH, God of Israel, to me: “Take the wine cup of this fury out of My hand, and you have caused all the nations to drink it to whom I am sending you; 
and they have drunk, and shaken themselves and shown themselves to be foolish, because of the sword that I am sending among them.” 
And I take the cup out of the hand of YHWH, and cause all the nations to drink to whom YHWH sent me: 
Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, || And its kings, its heads, || To give them to ruin, to astonishment, || To hissing, and to reviling, as at this day; 
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, || And his heads, and all his people, 
And all the mixed people, || And all the kings of the land of Uz, || And all the kings of the land of the Philistines, || And Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, || And the remnant of Ashdod, 
Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon, 
And all the kings of Tyre, || And all the kings of Sidon, || And the kings of the island that is beyond the sea, 
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, || And all cutting the corners of the beard, 
And all the kings of Arabia, || And all the kings of the mixed people, || Who are dwelling in the wilderness, 
And all the kings of Zimri, || And all the kings of Elam, || And all the kings of Media, 
And all the kings of the north, || The near and the far off to one another, || And all the kingdoms of the earth, || That are on the face of the ground, || And King Sheshach drinks after them. 
“And you have said to them, Thus said YHWH of Hosts, God of Israel: Drink, indeed drink abundantly, || And vomit, and fall, and do not rise, || Because of the sword that I am sending among you. 
And it has come to pass, || When they refuse to receive the cup out of your hand to drink, || That you have said to them, Thus said YHWH of Hosts: You certainly drink. 
For behold, in the city over which My Name is called, || I am beginning to bring ruin, || And are you entirely acquitted? You are not acquitted, for I am proclaiming a sword, || For all inhabitants of the land,” || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts. 
“And you, you prophesy all these words to them, and have said to them: YHWH roars from the high place, || And gives forth His voice from His holy habitation, || He surely roars for His habitation, || A shout as those treading the grapes, || God answers all the inhabitants of the land, 
A rumbling has come to the end of the earth, || For YHWH has a controversy with nations, || He has executed judgment for all flesh, || He has given the wicked to the sword,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
Thus said YHWH of Hosts: “Behold, evil is going out from nation to nation, || And a great whirlwind is stirred up from the sides of the earth. 
And the pierced of YHWH have been in that day, || From the end of the earth even to the end of the earth, || They are not lamented, nor gathered, nor buried, || For they are dung on the face of the ground. 
Howl, you shepherds, and cry, || And roll yourselves, you majestic of the flock, || For your days have been full || For slaughtering, and for your scatterings, || And you have fallen as a desirable vessel. 
And refuge has perished from the shepherds, || And escape from the majestic of the flock. 
A voice of the cry of the shepherds, || And a howling of the majestic of the flock, || For YHWH is spoiling their pasture. 
And the peaceable habitations have been cut down, || Because of the fierceness of the anger of YHWH. 
He has forsaken His covert as a young lion, || Surely their land has become a desolation, || Because of the oppressing fierceness, || And because of the fierceness of His anger!”
