2 Samuel.
Chapter 8.
And it comes to pass afterward that David strikes the Philistines, and humbles them, and David takes the bridle of the metropolis out of the hand of the Philistines. 
And he strikes Moab, and measures them with a line, causing them to lie down on the earth, and he measures two lines to put to death, and the fullness of the line to keep alive, and the Moabites are for servants to David, bearers of a present. 
And David strikes Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, in his going to bring back his power by the River Euphrates; 
and David captures from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David utterly destroys the whole of the charioteers; he leaves only one hundred of their charioteers. 
And Aram of Damascus comes to give help to Hadadezer king of Zobah, and David strikes twenty-two thousand men of Aram; 
and David puts garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and Aram is for a servant to David, carrying a present; and YHWH saves David wherever he has gone; 
and David takes the shields of gold which were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brings them to Jerusalem; 
and from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David has taken very much bronze. 
And Toi king of Hamath hears that David has struck all the force of Hadadezer, 
and Toi sends his son Joram to King David to ask of him of welfare, and to bless him (because that he has fought against Hadadezer, and strikes him, for Hadadezer had been a man of wars with Toi), and in his hand have been vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze, 
also King David sanctified them to YHWH, with the silver and the gold which he sanctified of all the nations which he subdued: 
of Aram, and of Moab, and of the sons of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah. 
And David makes a name in his turning back from his striking Aram in the Valley of Salt—eighteen thousand; 
and he puts garrisons in Edom—he has put garrisons in all of Edom, and all Edom are servants to David; and YHWH saves David wherever he has gone. 
And David reigns over all Israel, and David is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people, 
and Joab son of Zeruiah is over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud is remembrancer, 
and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech son of Abiathar, are priests, and Seraiah is scribe, 
and Benaiah son of Jehoiada is over both the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the sons of David have been ministers.
