Psalms.
Chapter 119.
ALEPH O the blessedness of those perfect in the way, || They are walking in the Law of YHWH, 
O the blessedness of those keeping His testimonies, || They seek Him with the whole heart. 
Indeed, they have not done iniquity, || They have walked in His ways. 
You have commanded us to diligently keep Your precepts, 
O that my ways were prepared to keep Your statutes, 
Then I am not ashamed || In my looking to all Your commands. 
I confess You with uprightness of heart, || In my learning the judgments of Your righteousness. 
I keep Your statutes, do not utterly leave me! 
BETH With what does a young man purify his path? To observe—according to Your word. 
I have sought You with all my heart, || Do not let me err from Your commands. 
I have hid Your saying in my heart, || That I do not sin before You. 
Blessed are You, O YHWH, teach me Your statutes. 
With my lips I have recounted || All the judgments of Your mouth. 
I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, || As over all wealth. 
I meditate on Your precepts, || And I attentively behold Your paths. 
I delight myself in Your statutes, || I do not forget Your word. 
GIMEL Confer benefits on Your servant, || I live, and I keep Your word. 
Uncover my eyes, and I behold wonders out of Your law. 
I am a sojourner on earth, || Do not hide Your commands from me. 
My soul has broken for desire || To Your judgments at all times. 
You have rebuked the cursed proud, || Who are erring from Your commands. 
Remove reproach and contempt from me, || For I have kept Your testimonies. 
Princes also sat—they spoke against me, || Your servant meditates on Your statutes, 
Your testimonies are also my delight, || The men of my counsel! 
DALETH My soul has cleaved to the dust, || Quicken me according to Your word. 
I have recounted my ways, || And You answer me, teach me Your statutes, 
Cause me to understand the way of Your precepts, || And I meditate on Your wonders. 
My soul has dropped from affliction, || Establish me according to Your word. 
Turn aside the way of falsehood from me || And favor me with Your law. 
I have chosen the way of faithfulness, || I have compared Your judgments, 
I have adhered to Your testimonies, || O YHWH, do not put me to shame. 
I run the way of Your commands, || For You enlarge my heart! 
HE Show me, O YHWH, the way of Your statutes, || And I keep it—to the end. 
Cause me to understand, and I keep Your law, || And observe it with the whole heart. 
Cause me to tread in the path of Your commands, || For I have delighted in it. 
Incline my heart to Your testimonies, || And not to dishonest gain. 
Remove my eyes from seeing vanity, || Quicken me in Your way. 
Establish Your saying to Your servant, || That is concerning Your fear. 
Remove my reproach that I have feared, || For Your judgments are good. 
Behold, I have longed for Your precepts, || Quicken me in Your righteousness, 
WAW And Your kindness meets me, O YHWH, || Your salvation according to Your saying. 
And I answer him who is reproaching me a word, || For I have trusted in Your word. 
And You do not utterly take away || The word of truth from my mouth, || Because I have hoped for Your judgment. 
And I keep Your law continually, || For all time and forever. 
And I habitually walk in a broad place, || For I have sought Your precepts. 
And I speak of Your testimonies before kings, || And I am not ashamed. 
And I delight myself in Your commands, || That I have loved, 
And I lift up my hands to Your commands, || That I have loved, || And I meditate on Your statutes! 
ZAYIN Remember the word to Your servant, || On which You have caused me to hope. 
This is my comfort in my affliction, || That Your saying has quickened me. 
The proud have utterly scorned me, || I have not turned aside from Your law. 
I remembered Your judgments of old, O YHWH, || And I comfort myself. 
Horror has seized me, || Because of the wicked forsaking Your law. 
Your statutes have been songs to me, || In the house of my sojournings. 
I have remembered Your Name in the night, O YHWH, || And I keep Your law. 
This has been to me, || That I have kept Your precepts! 
HETH YHWH is my portion; I have said I would keep Your words, 
I appeased Your face with the whole heart, || Favor me according to Your saying. 
I have reckoned my ways, || And turn back my feet to Your testimonies. 
I have made haste, || And did not delay, to keep Your commands. 
Cords of the wicked have surrounded me, || I have not forgotten Your law. 
At midnight I rise to give thanks to You, || For the judgments of Your righteousness. 
I am a companion to all who fear You, || And to those keeping Your precepts. 
Of Your kindness, O YHWH, the earth is full, || Teach me Your statutes! 
TETH You did good with Your servant, O YHWH, || According to Your word. 
Teach me the goodness of reason and knowledge, || For I have believed in Your commands. 
Before I am afflicted, I am erring, || And now I have kept Your saying. 
You are good, and doing good, || Teach me Your statutes. 
The proud have forged falsehood against me, || I keep Your precepts with the whole heart. 
Their heart has been thick as fat, || I have delighted in Your law. 
It is good for me that I have been afflicted, || That I might learn Your statutes. 
The Law of Your mouth is better to me || Than thousands of gold and silver! 
YOD Your hands made me and establish me, || Cause me to understand, and I learn Your commands. 
Those fearing You see me and rejoice, || Because I have hoped for Your word. 
I have known, O YHWH, || That Your judgments are righteous, || And in faithfulness You have afflicted me. 
Please let Your kindness be to comfort me, || According to Your saying to Your servant. 
Your mercies meet me, and I live, || For Your law is my delight. 
The proud are ashamed, || For with falsehood they dealt perversely with me. I meditate on Your precepts. 
Those fearing You turn back to me, || And those knowing Your testimonies. 
My heart is perfect in Your statutes, || So that I am not ashamed. 
KAPH My soul has been consumed for Your salvation, || I have hoped for Your word. 
My eyes have been consumed for Your word, || Saying, “When does it comfort me?” 
For I have been as a bottle in smoke, || I have not forgotten Your statutes. 
How many are the days of Your servant? When do You execute judgment || Against my pursuers? 
The proud have dug pits for me, || That are not according to Your law. 
All Your commands are faithfulness, || They have pursued me with falsehood, || Help me. 
They have almost consumed me on earth, || And I have not forsaken Your precepts. 
Quicken me according to Your kindness, || And I keep the Testimony of Your mouth! 
LAMED For all time, O YHWH, Your word is set up in the heavens. 
Your faithfulness from generation to generation, || You established earth, and it stands. 
According to Your ordinances || They have stood this day, for the whole—Your servants. 
Unless Your law were my delights, || Then had I perished in my affliction. 
I do not forget Your precepts for all time, || For You have quickened me by them. 
I am Yours, save me, for I have sought Your precepts. 
Your wicked waited for me to destroy me, || I understand Your testimonies.
