Job.
Chapter 35.
And Elihu answers and says: 
“Have you reckoned this for judgment when you have said, || My righteousness is more than God’s? 
For you say, What does it profit You? What do I profit from my sin? 
I return words, and your friends with you, 
Behold attentively the heavens—and see, || And behold the clouds, || They have been higher than you. 
If you have sinned, what do you do against Him? And your transgressions have been multiplied, || What do you do to Him? 
If you have been righteous, || What do you give to Him? Or what does He receive from your hand? 
For a man like yourself is your wickedness, || And for a son of man your righteousness. 
Because of the multitude of oppressions || They cause to cry out, || They cry because of the arm of the mighty. 
And none said, Where is God my Maker? Giving songs in the night, 
Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, || Indeed, He makes us wiser than the bird of the heavens. 
There they cry, and He does not answer, || Because of the pride of evildoers. 
Surely God does not hear vanity, || And the Mighty does not behold it. 
Indeed, though you say you do not behold Him, || Judgment is before Him, and stays for Him. 
And now, because there is not, || He has appointed His anger, || And He has not known in great extremity. 
And Job opens his mouth with vanity, || He multiplies words without knowledge.”
