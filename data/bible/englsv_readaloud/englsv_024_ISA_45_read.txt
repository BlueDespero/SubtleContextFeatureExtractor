Isaiah.
Chapter 45.
Thus said YHWH, || To His anointed, to Cyrus, || Whose right hand I have laid hold on, || To subdue nations before him, || Indeed, I loose loins of kings, || To open double doors before him, || Indeed, gates are not shut: 
“I go before you, and make crooked places straight, || I shatter doors of bronze, || And I cut bars of iron apart, 
And have given to you treasures of darkness, || Even treasures of secret places, || So that you know that I, YHWH, || Who am calling on your name—am the God of Israel. 
For the sake of My servant Jacob, || And of Israel My chosen, || I also call you by your name, I surname you, || And you have not known Me. 
I am YHWH, and there is none else, || There is no God except Me, || I gird you, and you have not known Me. 
So that they know from the rising of the sun, || And from the west, that there is none besides Me, || I am YHWH, and there is none else, 
Forming light, and creating darkness, || Making peace, and creating calamity, || I am YHWH, doing all these things. 
Drop, you heavens, from above, || And clouds cause righteousness to flow, || Earth opens, and they are fruitful, || Salvation and righteousness spring up together, || I, YHWH, have created it. 
Woe to him who is striving with his Former || (A potsherd with potsherds of the ground!) Does clay say to its Framer, What are you doing? And your work, He has no hands? 
Woe to him who is saying to a father, What do you beget? Or to a wife, What do you bring forth?” 
Thus said YHWH, The Holy One of Israel, and his Former: “Ask Me of the things coming concerning My sons, || Indeed, concerning the work of My hands, you command Me. 
I made earth, and created man on it, || My hands stretched out the heavens, || And I have commanded all their host. 
I have stirred him up in righteousness, || And I make all his ways straight, || He builds My city, and sends out My captivity, || Not for price, nor for bribe,” said YHWH of Hosts. 
Thus said YHWH: “The labor of Egypt, || And the merchandise of Cush, || And of the Sebaim—men of measure, || Pass over to you, and they are yours, || They go after you, they pass over in chains, || And they bow themselves to you, || They pray to you: Surely God is in you, || And there is none else, no other God.” 
Surely You are a God hiding Yourself, God of Israel—Savior! 
They have been ashamed, || And they have even blushed—all of them, || Those carving images have gone together in confusion. 
Israel has been saved in YHWH, || A perpetual salvation! You are not ashamed nor confounded || For all ages of eternity! 
For thus said YHWH, Creator of the heavens, || He is God, || Former of earth, and its Maker, || He established it—He did not create it empty, || For He formed it to be inhabited: “I am YHWH, and there is none else. 
I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth, || I have not said to the seed of Jacob, || Seek Me in vain, || I am YHWH, speaking righteousness, || Declaring uprightness. 
Be gathered, and come in, || Come near together, you escaped of the nations, || They have not known, || Who are lifting up the wood of their carved image, || And praying to a god that does not save. 
Declare, and bring near, || Indeed, they take counsel together, || Who has proclaimed this from of old? Who has declared it from that time? Is it not I—YHWH? And there is no other god besides Me, || A God righteous and saving, there is none except Me. 
Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth, || For I am God, and there is none else. 
I have sworn by Myself, || A word has gone out from My mouth in righteousness, || And it does not return, || That to Me, every knee bows, every tongue swears. 
Only in YHWH, one has said, || Do I have righteousness and strength, || He comes to Him, || And all those displeased with Him are ashamed. 
In YHWH are all the seed of Israel justified, || And they boast themselves.”
