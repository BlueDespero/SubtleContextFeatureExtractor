Psalms.
Chapter 83.
A SONG. A PSALM OF ASAPH. O God, let there be no silence to You, || Do not be silent, nor be quiet, O God. 
For behold, Your enemies roar, || And those hating You have lifted up the head, 
They take crafty counsel against Your people, || And consult against Your hidden ones. 
They have said, “Come, and we cut them off from being a nation, || And the name of Israel is not remembered anymore.” 
For they consulted in heart together, || They make a covenant against You, 
Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes, 
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre, 
Asshur is also joined with them, || They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah. 
Do to them as Midian, || As Sisera, as Jabin, at the Brook of Kishon. 
They were destroyed at Endor, || They were dung for the ground! 
Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, || And as Zebah and Zalmunna—all their princes, 
Who have said, “Let us occupy the pastures of God for ourselves.” 
O my God, make them as a rolling thing, || As stubble before wind. 
As a fire burns a forest, || And as a flame sets hills on fire, 
So You pursue them with Your whirlwind, || And trouble them with Your windstorm. 
Fill their faces with shame, || And they seek Your Name, O YHWH. 
They are ashamed and troubled forever, || Indeed, they are confounded and lost. 
And they know that You—Your Name is YHWH—By Yourself are the Most High over all the earth!
