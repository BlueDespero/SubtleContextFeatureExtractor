Amos.
Chapter 4.
Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, || Who are on the mountain of Samaria, || Who are oppressing the poor, || Who are bruising the needy, || Who are saying to their lords: “Bring in, and we drink.” 
Lord YHWH has sworn by His holiness, || “Behold, days are coming on you, || And He has taken you away with hooks, || And your posterity with fish-hooks. 
And by breaches you go forth, || A woman before her, || And you have cast down the high place,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“Enter Beth-El, and transgress, || At Gilgal multiply transgression, || And bring in your sacrifices every morning, || Your tithes every third year. 
And burn a thank-offering with leaven as incense, || And proclaim willing gifts, sound! For so you have loved, O sons of Israel,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
“And I also—I have given to you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, || And lack of bread in all your places, || And you have not turned back to Me,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“And I also—I have withheld from you the rain, || While yet three months to harvest, || And I have sent rain on one city, || And on another city I do not send rain, || One portion is rained on, || And the portion on which it does not rain withers. 
And two or three cities have wandered, || To the same city to drink water, || And they are not satisfied, || And you have not turned back to Me,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“I have struck you with blasting and with mildew, || The abundance of your gardens and of your vineyards, || And of your figs, and of your olives, || The palmer-worm eats, || And you have not turned back to Me,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“I have sent among you pestilence by the way of Egypt, || I have slain your choice ones by sword, || With your captive horses, || And I cause the stink of your camps to come up—Even into your nostrils, || And you have not turned back to Me,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“I have overturned among you, || Like the overturn by God of Sodom and Gomorrah, || And you are as a brand delivered from a burning, || And you have not turned back to Me,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“Therefore, thus I do to you, O Israel, at last, || Because this I do to you, || Prepare to meet your God, O Israel.” 
For behold, the Former of mountains, and Creator of wind, || And the Declarer to man what is His thought, || He is making dawn obscurity, || And is treading on high places of earth, || YHWH, God of Hosts, is His Name!
