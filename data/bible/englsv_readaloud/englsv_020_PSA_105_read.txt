Psalms.
Chapter 105.
Give thanks to YHWH—call on His Name, || Make His acts known among the peoples. 
Sing to Him—sing praise to Him, || Meditate on all His wonders. 
Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, || The heart of those seeking YHWH rejoices. 
Seek YHWH and His strength, || Seek His face continually. 
Remember His wonders that He did, || His signs and the judgments of His mouth. 
O seed of Abraham, His servant, || O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones. 
He is our God YHWH, || His judgments are in all the earth. 
He has remembered His covenant for all time, || The word He commanded to one thousand generations, 
That He has made with Abraham, || And His oath to Isaac, 
And establishes it to Jacob for a statute, || To Israel—a perpetual covenant, 
Saying, “I give the land of Canaan to you, || The portion of your inheritance,” 
In their being few in number, || But a few, and sojourners in it. 
And they go up and down, from nation to nation, || From a kingdom to another people. 
He has not permitted any to oppress them || And He reproves kings for their sakes. 
“Do not strike against My anointed, || And do no evil to My prophets.” 
And He calls a famine on the land, || He has broken the whole staff of bread. 
He has sent a man before them, || Joseph has been sold for a servant. 
They have afflicted his feet with chains, || Iron has entered his soul, 
Until the time of the coming of His word || The saying of YHWH has tried him. 
The king has sent, and looses him, || The ruler of the peoples, and draws him out. 
He has made him lord of his house, || And ruler over all his possessions. 
To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, || And he makes his elderly wise. 
And Israel comes into Egypt, || And Jacob has sojourned in the land of Ham. 
And He makes His people very fruitful, || And makes it mightier than its adversaries. 
He turned their heart to hate His people, || To conspire against His servants. 
He has sent His servant Moses, || Aaron whom He had fixed on. 
They have set among them the matters of His signs, || And wonders in the land of Ham. 
He has sent darkness, and it is dark, || And they have not provoked His word. 
He has turned their waters to blood, || And puts their fish to death. 
Their land has teemed with frogs, || In the inner chambers of their kings. 
He has commanded, and the beetle comes, || Lice into all their border. 
He has made their showers hail, || A flaming fire is in their land. 
And He strikes their vine and their fig, || And shatters the trees of their border. 
He has commanded, and the locust comes, || And the cankerworm—innumerable, 
And it consumes every herb in their land, || And it consumes the fruit of their ground. 
And He strikes every firstborn in their land, || The first-fruit of all their strength, 
And brings them out with silver and gold, || And there is not a feeble one in its tribes. 
Egypt has rejoiced in their going forth, || For their fear had fallen on them. 
He has spread a cloud for a covering, || And fire to enlighten the night. 
They have asked, and He brings quails, || And satisfies them with bread of the heavens. 
He has opened a rock, and waters flow, || They have gone on in dry places—a river. 
For He has remembered His holy word, || With His servant Abraham, 
And He brings forth His people with joy, || His chosen ones with singing. 
And He gives to them the lands of nations, || And they possess the labor of peoples, 
That they may observe His statutes, || And may keep His laws. Praise YAH!
