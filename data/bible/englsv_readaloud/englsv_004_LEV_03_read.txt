Leviticus.
Chapter 3.
“And if his offering is a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if he is bringing near out of the herd, whether male or female, he brings a perfect one near before YHWH, 
and he has laid his hand on the head of his offering, and has slaughtered it at the opening of the Tent of Meeting, and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood around the altar. 
And he has brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to YHWH, the fat which is covering the innards, and all the fat which is on the innards, 
and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance on the liver above the kidneys—he turns it aside, 
and sons of Aaron have made it an incense on the altar, on the burnt-offering which is on the wood, which is on the fire, as a fire-offering of refreshing fragrance to YHWH. 
And if his offering is out of the flock for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to YHWH, male or female, he brings a perfect one near; 
if he is bringing a sheep near for his offering, then he has brought it near before YHWH, 
and has laid his hand on the head of his offering, and has slaughtered it before the Tent of Meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood around the altar. 
And he has brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to YHWH, its fat, the whole fat tail close by the bone—he turns it aside, and the fat which is covering the innards, and all the fat which is on the innards, 
and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance on the liver above the kidneys—he turns it aside, 
and the priest has made it an incense on the altar as bread of a fire-offering to YHWH. 
And if his offering is a goat, then he has brought it near before YHWH, 
and has laid his hand on its head, and has slaughtered it before the Tent of Meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood around the altar; 
and he has brought his offering near from it, a fire-offering to YHWH, the fat which is covering the innards, and all the fat which is on the innards, 
and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance on the liver above the kidneys—he turns it aside, 
and the priest has made them an incense on the altar as bread of a fire-offering, for refreshing fragrance; all the fat is YHWH’s. 
This is a continuous statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you do not eat any fat or any blood.”
