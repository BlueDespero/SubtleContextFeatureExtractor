Psalms.
Chapter 136.
Give thanks to YHWH, || For He is good, for His kindness is for all time. 
Give thanks to the God of gods, || For His kindness is for all time. 
Give thanks to the Lord of lords, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him doing great wonders by Himself alone, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him making the heavens by understanding, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him spreading the earth over the waters, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him making great lights, || For His kindness is for all time. 
The sun to rule by day, || For His kindness is for all time. 
The moon and stars to rule by night, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him striking Egypt in their firstborn, || For His kindness is for all time. 
And bringing forth Israel from their midst, || For His kindness is for all time. 
By a strong hand and an outstretched-arm, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him cutting the Sea of Suph into parts, || For His kindness is for all time, 
And caused Israel to pass through its midst, || For His kindness is for all time, 
And shook out Pharaoh and his force in the Sea of Suph, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him leading His people in a wilderness, || For His kindness is for all time. 
To Him striking great kings, || For His kindness is for all time. 
Indeed, He slays majestic kings, || For His kindness is for all time. 
Even Sihon king of the Amorite, || For His kindness is for all time. 
And Og king of Bashan, || For His kindness is for all time. 
And He gave their land for inheritance, || For His kindness is for all time. 
An inheritance to Israel His servant, || For His kindness is for all time. 
Who has remembered us in our lowliness, || For His kindness is for all time. 
And He delivers us from our adversaries, || For His kindness is for all time. 
Giving food to all flesh, || For His kindness is for all time. 
Give thanks to the God of the heavens, || For His kindness is for all time!
