Zechariah.
Chapter 12.
The burden of a word of YHWH on Israel. A declaration of YHWH, || Stretching out the heavens, and founding earth, || And forming the spirit of man in his midst: 
“Behold, I am making Jerusalem a cup of reeling || To all the surrounding peoples, || And it is also against Judah, || In the siege against Jerusalem. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all the peoples, || All loading it are completely pressed down, || And gathered against it have been all nations of the earth. 
In that day,” a declaration of YHWH, || “I strike every horse with astonishment, || And its rider with madness, || And on the house of Judah I open My eyes, || And every horse of the peoples I strike with blindness. 
And leaders of Judah have said in their heart, || The inhabitants of Jerusalem are strength to me, || In YHWH of Hosts their God. 
In that day I make the leaders of Judah || As a hearth of fire among trees, || And as a torch of fire in a sheaf, || And they have consumed—on the right and on the left—all the surrounding peoples, || And Jerusalem has again inhabited her place in Jerusalem. 
And YHWH has saved the tents of Judah first, || So that the beauty of the house of David does not become great against Judah, || And the beauty of the inhabitant of Jerusalem. 
In that day YHWH covers over the inhabitant of Jerusalem, || And the stumbling among them has been in that day as David, || And the house of David as God—As the Messenger of YHWH—before them. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || I seek to destroy all the nations || Who are coming in against Jerusalem, 
And I have poured on the house of David, || And on the inhabitant of Jerusalem, || The Spirit of grace and supplications, || And they have looked to Me whom they pierced, || And they have mourned over Him, || Like a mourning over the only one, || And they have been in bitterness for Him, || Like a bitterness over the firstborn. 
In that day, great is the mourning of Jerusalem, || As the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddon, 
And the land has mourned—every family apart, || The family of the house of David apart, || And their women apart; The family of the house of Nathan apart, || And their women apart; 
The family of the house of Levi apart, || And their women apart; The family of Shimei apart, || And their women apart, 
All the families that are left, || Every family apart, and their women apart!”
