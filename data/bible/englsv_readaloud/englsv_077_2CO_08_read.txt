2 Corinthians.
Chapter 8.
And we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God, that has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia, 
because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality; 
because, according to their power, I testify, and above their power, they were willing of themselves, 
with much plea calling on us to receive the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the holy ones, 
and not according as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the LORD, and to us, through the will of God, 
so that we exhorted Titus, that, according as he began before, so also he may also finish this favor to you, 
but even as in everything you abound, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, that also in this grace you may abound; 
I do not speak according to command, but because of the diligence of others, and proving the genuineness of your love, 
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that because of you He became poor—being rich, that you may become rich by that poverty. 
And I give an opinion in this: for this is expedient to you, who not only to do, but also to will, began before—a year ago, 
and now also finish doing it, that even as there is the readiness of the will, so also the finishing, out of that which you have, 
for if the willing mind is present, it is well-accepted according to that which anyone may have, not according to that which he does not have; 
for I do not speak that for others to be released, and you pressured, 
but by equality, at the present time your abundance—for their want, that also their abundance may be for your want, that there may be equality, 
according as it has been written: “He who gathered much, had nothing over; and he who gathered little, had no lack.” 
And thanks to God, who is putting the same diligence for you in the heart of Titus, 
because he indeed accepted the exhortation, and being more diligent, he went forth to you of his own accord, 
and we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the good news is through all the assemblies, 
and not only so, but who was also appointed by vote by the assemblies, our fellow-traveler, with this favor that is ministered by us, to the glory of the same Lord, and your willing mind; 
avoiding this, lest anyone may blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us, 
providing right things, not only before the LORD, but also before men; 
and we sent our brother with them, whom we proved being diligent many times in many things, and now much more diligent, by the great confidence that is toward you, 
whether—about Titus—my partner and fellow-worker toward you, whether—our brothers, apostles of assemblies—glory of Christ; 
the showing therefore of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf, show to them, even in the face of the assemblies.
