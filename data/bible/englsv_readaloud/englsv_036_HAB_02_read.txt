Habakkuk.
Chapter 2.
On my charge I stand, and I station myself on a bulwark, and I watch to see what He speaks against me, and what I reply to my reproof. 
And YHWH answers me and says: “Write a vision, and explain on the tablets, || That he may run who is reading it. 
For yet the vision is for a season, || And it breathes for the end, and does not lie, || If it lingers, wait for it, || For surely it comes, it is not late. 
Behold, a presumptuous one! His soul is not upright within him, || And the righteous lives by his faith. 
And also, because the wine is treacherous, || A man is haughty, and does not remain at home, || Who has enlarged his soul as Sheol, || And is as death that is not satisfied, || And gathers to itself all the nations, || And assembles to itself all the peoples, 
Are these not—all of them—an allegory taken up against him, || And a moral of acute sayings for him, || And say, Woe to him who is multiplying what is not his? Until when also is he multiplying to himself heavy pledges? 
Do your usurers not instantly rise up, || And those shaking you awake, || And you have been a spoil to them? 
Because you have spoiled many nations, || All the remnant of the peoples spoil you, || Because of man’s blood, and of violence to the land, || To the city, and to all dwelling in it. 
Woe to him who is gaining evil gain for his house, || To set his nest on high, || To be delivered from the hand of evil, 
You have counseled a shameful thing to your house, || To cut off many peoples, and your soul is sinful. 
For a stone cries out from the wall, || And a beam from the wood answers it. 
Woe to him who is building a city by blood, || And establishing a city by iniquity. 
Behold, is it not from YHWH of Hosts || And peoples are fatigued for fire, || And nations for vanity are weary? 
For the earth is full of the knowledge of the glory of YHWH, || As the waters cover over a sea. 
Woe to him who is giving drink to his neighbor, || Pouring out your bottle, and also making drunk, || In order to look on their nakedness. 
You have been filled—shame without honor, || Drink also, and be uncircumcised, || Turn around to you does the cup of the right hand of YHWH, || And shameful spewing is on your glory. 
For violence done to Lebanon covers you, || And spoil of beasts frightens them, || Because of man’s blood, and of violence to the land, || To the city, and to all dwelling in it. 
What profit has a carved image given || That its former has hewn it? A molten image and teacher of falsehood, || That the former has trusted on his own formation—to make mute idols? 
Woe to him who is saying to wood, Awake, || To a mute stone, Stir up, || It is a teacher! Behold, it is overlaid—gold and silver, || And there is no spirit in its midst. 
And YHWH is in His holy temple, || Be silent before Him, all the earth!”
