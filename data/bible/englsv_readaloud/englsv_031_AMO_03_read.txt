Amos.
Chapter 3.
Hear this word that YHWH has spoken concerning you, O sons of Israel, concerning all the family that I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, 
“Only you have I known of all families of the earth, || Therefore I charge on you all your iniquities.” 
Do two walk together if they have not met? 
Does a lion roar in a forest and he has no prey? Does a young lion give out his voice from his habitation, || If he has not caught? 
Does a bird fall into a snare of the earth, || And there is no trap for it? Does a snare go up from the ground, || And it does not capture prey? 
Is a horn blown in a city, || And do people not tremble? Is there affliction in a city, || And YHWH has not done it? 
For Lord YHWH does nothing, || Except He has revealed His counsel to His servants the prophets. 
A lion has roared—who does not fear? Lord YHWH has spoken—who does not prophesy? 
“Sound to palaces in Ashdod, || And to palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: Be gathered on mountains of Samaria, || And see many troubles within her, || And oppressed ones in her midst. 
And they have not known to act straightforwardly,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “Who are treasuring up violence and spoil in their palaces.” 
Therefore, thus said Lord YHWH: “An adversary—and surrounding the land, || And he has brought down your strength from you, || And your palaces have been spoiled.” 
Thus said YHWH: “As the shepherd delivers from the lion’s mouth || Two legs, or a piece of an ear, || So the sons of Israel are delivered, || Who are sitting in Samaria on the corner of a bed, || And in Damascus on that of a couch. 
Hear and testify to the house of Jacob,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH, God of Hosts. 
“For in the day of My charging the transgressions of Israel on him, I have laid a charge on the altars of Beth-El, || And the horns of the altar have been cut off, || And they have fallen to the earth. 
And I have struck the winter-house with the summer-house, || And houses of ivory have perished, || And many houses have been consumed,” || A declaration of YHWH!
