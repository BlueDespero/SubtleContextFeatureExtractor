Job.
Chapter 29.
And Job adds to lift up his allegory and says: 
“Who makes me as in months past, || As in the days of God’s preserving me? 
In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, || By His light I walk through darkness. 
As I have been in days of my maturity, || And the counsel of God on my tent. 
When yet the Mighty One is with me. Around me—my young ones, 
When washing my goings with butter, || And the firm rock is with me—streams of oil. 
When I go out to the gate by the city, || In a broad place I prepare my seat. 
Youths have seen me, and they have been hidden, || And the aged have risen—they stood up. 
Princes have kept in words, || And they place a hand on their mouth. 
The voice of leaders has been hidden, || And their tongue has cleaved to the palate. 
For the ear heard, and declares me blessed, || And the eye has seen, and testifies to me. 
For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, || And the fatherless who has no helper. 
The blessing of the perishing comes on me, || And I cause the heart of the widow to sing. 
I have put on righteousness, and it clothes me, || My justice as a robe and a crown. 
I have been eyes to the blind, || And I am feet to the lame. 
I am a father to the needy, || And the cause I have not known I search out. 
And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, || And from his teeth I cast away prey. 
And I say, I expire with my nest, || And I multiply days as the sand. 
My root is open to the waters, || And dew lodges on my branch. 
My glory is fresh with me, || And my bow is renewed in my hand. 
They have listened to me, || Indeed, they wait, and are silent for my counsel. 
After my word they do not change, || And my speech drops on them, 
And they wait for me as for rain, || And they have opened wide their mouth || As for the spring rain. 
I laugh at them—they give no credence, || And do not cause the light of my face to fall. 
I choose their way, and sit as head, || And I dwell as a king in a troop, || When he comforts mourners.”
