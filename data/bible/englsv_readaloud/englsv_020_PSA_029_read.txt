Psalms.
Chapter 29.
A PSALM OF DAVID. Ascribe to YHWH, you sons of the mighty, || Ascribe to YHWH glory and strength. 
Ascribe to YHWH the glory of His Name, || Bow yourselves to YHWH, || In the beauty of holiness. 
The voice of YHWH is on the waters, || The God of glory has thundered, || YHWH is on many waters. 
The voice of YHWH is with power, || The voice of YHWH is with majesty, 
The voice of YHWH is shattering cedars, || Indeed, YHWH shatters the cedars of Lebanon. 
And He causes them to skip as a calf, || Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems, 
The voice of YHWH is hewing fiery flames, 
The voice of YHWH pains a wilderness, || YHWH pains the wilderness of Kadesh. 
The voice of YHWH pains the oaks, || And makes bare the forests, || And in His temple everyone says, “Glory!” 
YHWH has sat on the flood, || And YHWH sits as king for all time, 
YHWH gives strength to His people, || YHWH blesses His people with peace!
