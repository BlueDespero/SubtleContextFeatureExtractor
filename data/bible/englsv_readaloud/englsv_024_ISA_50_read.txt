Isaiah.
Chapter 50.
Thus said YHWH: “Where is this—the bill of your mother’s divorce, || Whom I sent away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you have been sold for your iniquities, || And for your transgressions || Your mother has been sent away. 
Why have I come, and there is no one? I called, and there is none answering, || Has My hand been at all short of redemption? And is there not power in Me to deliver? Behold, by My rebuke I dry up a sea, || I make rivers a wilderness, || Their fish stink, for there is no water, || And die with thirst. 
I clothe the heavens with blackness, || And I make their covering sackcloth.” 
Lord YHWH has given to Me || The tongue of taught ones, || To know to aid the weary by a word, || He awakens Me morning by morning, || He awakens My ear to hear as taught ones. 
Lord YHWH opened My ear, || And I did not rebel—I did not move backward. 
I have given My back to those striking, || And My cheeks to those plucking out, || I did not hide My face from shame and spitting. 
And Lord YHWH gives help to Me, || Therefore I have not been ashamed, || Therefore I have set My face as a flint, || And I know that I am not ashamed. 
Near is He who is justifying Me, || Who contends with Me? We stand together, who is My opponent? Let him come near to Me. 
Behold, Lord YHWH gives help to Me, || Who is he that declares Me wicked? Behold, all of them wear out as a garment, || A moth eats them. 
“Who is among you, fearing YHWH, || Listening to the voice of His Servant, || That has walked in dark places, || And there is no brightness for him? Let him trust in the Name of YHWH, || And lean on his God. 
Behold, all you kindling a fire, girding on sparks, || Walk in the light of your fire, || And in the sparks you have caused to burn, || This has been to you from My hand, || You lie down in grief!”
