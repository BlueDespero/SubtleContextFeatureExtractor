Job.
Chapter 21.
And Job answers and says: 
“Hear my word diligently, || And this is your consolation. 
Bear with me, and I speak, || And after my speaking—you may deride. 
Is my complaint against man? And if so, why may my temper not become short? 
Turn to me, and be astonished, || And put hand to mouth. 
Indeed, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And my flesh has taken fright. 
Why do the wicked live? They have become old, || Indeed, they have been mighty in wealth. 
Their seed is established, || Before their face with them, || And their offspring before their eyes. 
Their houses are peace without fear, || Nor is a rod of God on them. 
His bullock breeds without fail. His cow brings forth safely, and does not miscarry. 
They send forth their sucklings as a flock, || And their children skip, 
They lift themselves up at timbrel and harp, || And rejoice at the sound of a pipe. 
They wear out their days in good, || And in a moment go down to Sheol. 
And they say to God, Turn aside from us, || And the knowledge of Your ways || We have not desired. 
What is the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him? 
Behold, their good is not in their hand || (The counsel of the wicked || Has been far from me). 
How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, || And their calamity comes on them? He apportions pangs in His anger. 
They are as straw before wind, || And as chaff a windstorm has stolen away, 
God lays up for his sons his sorrow, || He gives repayment to him—and he knows. 
His own eyes see his destruction, || And he drinks of the wrath of the Mighty. 
For what is his delight in his house after him, || And the number of his months cut off? 
Does one teach knowledge to God, || Since He judges those on high? 
This one dies in his perfect strength, || Wholly at ease and quiet. 
His breasts have been full of milk, || And marrow moistens his bones. 
And this one dies with a bitter soul, || And has not eaten with gladness. 
Together they lie down on the dust, || And the worm covers them over. 
Behold, I have known your thoughts, || And the schemes against me you do wrongfully. 
For you say, Where is the house of the noble? And where the tent—the dwelling places of the wicked? 
Have you not asked those passing by the way? And do you not know their signs? 
That the wicked is spared to a day of calamity. They are brought to a day of wrath. 
Who declares his way to his face? And for that which he has done, || Who gives repayment to him? 
And he is brought to the graves, || And a watch is kept over the heap. 
The clods of the valley have been sweet to him, || And he draws every man after him, || And there is no numbering before him. 
And how do you comfort me with vanity, || And trespass has been left in your answers?”
