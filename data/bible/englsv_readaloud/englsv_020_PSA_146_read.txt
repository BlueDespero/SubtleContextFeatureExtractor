Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Praise YAH! Praise, O my soul, YHWH. 
I praise YHWH during my life, || I sing praise to my God while I exist. 
Do not trust in princes—in a son of man, || For he has no deliverance. 
His spirit goes forth, he returns to his earth, || In that day his thoughts have perished. 
O the blessedness of him || Who has the God of Jacob for his help, || His hope is on his God YHWH, 
Making the heavens and earth, || The sea and all that is in them, || Who is keeping truth for all time, 
Doing judgment for the oppressed, || Giving bread to the hungry. 
YHWH is loosing the prisoners, || YHWH is opening (the eyes of) the blind, || YHWH is raising the bowed down, || YHWH is loving the righteous, 
YHWH is preserving the strangers, || He causes the fatherless and widow to stand, || And He turns the way of the wicked upside down. 
YHWH reigns for all time, || Your God, O Zion, to generation and generation, || Praise YAH!
