1 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
The word is steadfast: If anyone longs for overseership, he desires a right work; 
it is required, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, a husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, respectable, a friend of strangers, apt to teach, 
not given to wine, not a striker, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money, 
leading his own house well, having children in subjection with all dignity, 
(and if anyone has not known how to lead his own house, how will he take care of an assembly of God?) 
not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the Devil; 
and it is required of him also to have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil. 
Servants, in like manner, dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to shameful gain, 
having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience, 
and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable. 
Women, in like manner, dignified, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things. 
Servants—let them be husbands of one wife, leading the children well, and their own houses, 
for those who ministered well acquire a good step to themselves, and much boldness in faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
I write to you these things, hoping to come to you soon, 
and if I delay, that you may know how it is required to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God—a pillar and foundation of the truth, 
and confessedly, great is the secret of piety: who was revealed in flesh, declared righteous in the Spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!
