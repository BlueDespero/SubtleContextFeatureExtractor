Psalms.
Chapter 114.
In the going out of Israel from Egypt, || The house of Jacob from a strange people, 
Judah became His sanctuary, || Israel his dominion. 
The sea has seen, and flees, || The Jordan turns backward. 
The mountains have skipped as rams, || Heights as sons of a flock. 
What is ailing you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, you turn back! 
O mountains, you skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock! 
From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, || From before the God of Jacob, 
He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, || The flint to a fountain of waters!
