Jeremiah.
Chapter 45.
The word that Jeremiah the prophet has spoken to Baruch son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
“Thus said YHWH, God of Israel, concerning you, O Baruch: 
You have said, Woe to me, now, for YHWH has added sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and I have not found rest. 
Thus you say to him, Thus said YHWH: Behold, that which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself. 
And you seek for great things—do not seek, for behold, I am bringing calamity on all flesh—a declaration of YHWH—and I have given your life to you for a spoil, in all places to where you go.”
