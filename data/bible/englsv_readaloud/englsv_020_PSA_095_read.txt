Psalms.
Chapter 95.
Come, we sing to YHWH, || We shout to the rock of our salvation. 
We come before His face with thanksgiving, || We shout to Him with psalms. 
For YHWH is a great God, || And a great King over all gods. 
In whose hand are the deep places of earth, || And the strong places of hills are His. 
Whose is the sea, and He made it, || And His hands formed the dry land. 
Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, || We kneel before YHWH our Maker. 
For He is our God, and we the people of His pasture, || And the flock of His hand, || Today, if you listen to His voice, 
Do not harden your heart as in Meribah, || As in the day of Massah in the wilderness, 
Where your fathers have tried Me, || Have proved Me, indeed, have seen My work. 
Forty years I am weary of the generation, || And I say, “A people erring in heart—they! And they have not known My ways”: 
Where I swore in My anger, “If they come into My rest—!”
