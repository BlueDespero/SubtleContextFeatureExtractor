Jonah.
Chapter 3.
And there is a word of YHWH to Jonah a second time, saying, 
“Rise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the proclamation that I am speaking to you”; 
and Jonah rises, and he goes to Nineveh, according to the word of YHWH. And Nineveh has been a great city before God, a journey of three days. 
And Jonah begins to go into the city—a journey of one day—and proclaims and says, “Yet forty days and Nineveh is overturned!” 
And the men of Nineveh believe in God, and proclaim a fast, and put on sackcloth, from their greatest even to their least, 
seeing the word comes to the king of Nineveh, and he rises from his throne, and removes his honorable robe from off him, and spreads out sackcloth, and sits on the ashes, 
and he cries and says in Nineveh by a decree of the king and his great ones, saying, “Man and beast, herd and flock—do not let them taste anything, do not let them feed, do not even let them drink water; 
and let man and beast cover themselves with sackcloth, and let them call to God mightily, and let them each turn back from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 
Who knows? He turns back, and God has relented, and has turned back from the heat of His anger, and we do not perish.” 
And God sees their works, that they have turned back from their evil way, and God relents of the evil that He spoke of doing to them, and He has not done it.
