Psalms.
Chapter 138.
BY DAVID. I confess You with all my heart, || I praise You before the gods. 
I bow myself toward Your holy temple, || And I confess Your Name, || For Your kindness, and for Your truth, || For You have made Your saying great above all Your Name. 
In the day I called, when You answer me, || You strengthen me in my soul with strength. 
O YHWH, all kings of earth confess You, || When they have heard the sayings of Your mouth. 
And they sing in the ways of YHWH, || For the glory of YHWH is great. 
For YHWH is high, and He sees the lowly, || And He knows the haughty from afar. 
If I walk in the midst of distress You quicken me, || You send forth Your hand against the anger of my enemies, || And Your right hand saves me. 
YHWH perfects for me, || O YHWH, Your kindness is for all time, || Do not let the works of Your hands fall!
