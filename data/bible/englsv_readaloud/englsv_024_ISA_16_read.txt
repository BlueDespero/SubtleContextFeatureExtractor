Isaiah.
Chapter 16.
Send a lamb to the ruler of the land, || From Selah in the wilderness, || To the mountain of the daughter of Zion. 
And it has come to pass, || As a wandering bird, cast out of a nest, || Are daughters of Moab, at fords of Arnon. 
Bring in counsel, do judgment, || Make your shadow as night in the midst of noon, || Hide outcasts, do not reveal the wanderer. 
My outcasts sojourn in you, O Moab, || Be a secret hiding place for them, || From the face of a destroyer, || For the extortioner has ceased, || Devastation has been finished, || The tramplers are consumed out of the land. 
And the throne is established in kindness, || And One has sat on it in truth, in the tent of David, || Judging and seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness. 
We have heard of the pride of Moab—very proud, || His pride, and his arrogance, and his wrath—his boastings are not right. 
Therefore Moab howls for Moab, all of it howls, || It meditates for the grape-cakes of Kir-Hareseth, || They are surely struck. 
Because fields of Heshbon languish, || The vine of Sibmah, || Lords of nations beat her choice vines, || They have come to Jazer, || They have wandered in a wilderness, || Her plants have spread themselves, || They have passed over a sea. 
Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer, || The vine of Sibmah, || I water you with my tear, || O Heshbon and Elealeh, || For—for your summer fruits, and for your harvest, || The shouting has fallen. 
And gladness and joy have been removed from the fruitful field, || And they do not sing in vineyards, nor shout, || The treader does not tread wine in the presses, || I have caused shouting to cease. 
Therefore my bowels sound as a harp for Moab, || And my inward parts for Kir-Haresh. 
And it has come to pass, when it has been seen, || That Moab has been weary on the high place, || And he has come to his sanctuary to pray, || And is not able. 
This is the word that YHWH has spoken to Moab from that time, 
And now YHWH has spoken, saying, “In three years, as years of a hired worker, || The glory of Moab is lightly esteemed, || With all the great multitude, || And the remnant is little, small, not mighty!”
