Micah.
Chapter 4.
And it has come to pass, || In the latter end of the days, || The mountain of the house of YHWH || Is established above the top of the mountains, || And it has been lifted up above the hills, || And flowed to it have peoples. 
And gone have many nations and said, || “Come and we go up to the mountain of YHWH, || And to the house of the God of Jacob, || And He teaches us of His ways, || And we walk in His paths,” || For a law goes forth from Zion, || And a word of YHWH from Jerusalem. 
And He has judged between many peoples, || And given a decision to mighty nations far off, || They have beaten their swords to plowshares, || And their spears to pruning-hooks, || Nation does not lift up sword to nation, || Nor do they learn war anymore. 
And they have sat each under his vine, || And under his fig tree, || And there is none troubling, || For the mouth of YHWH of Hosts has spoken. 
For all the peoples walk, || Each in the name of its god—and we, || We walk in the Name of our God YHWH, || For all time and forever. 
“In that day,” a declaration of YHWH, || “I gather the halting one, || And the driven away one I bring together, || And she whom I have afflicted. 
And I have set the halting for a remnant, || And the far-off for a mighty nation, || And YHWH has reigned over them in Mount Zion, || From now on, and for all time. 
And you, O Tower of Eder, || Fort of the daughter of Zion, to you it comes, || Indeed, the former rule has come in, || The kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.” 
Now why do you shout aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counselor perished, || That pain as of a travailing woman has taken hold of you? 
Be pained, and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, || As a travailing woman, || For now you go forth from the city, || And you have dwelt in the field, || And you have gone to Babylon, || There you are delivered, || There YHWH redeems you from the hand of your enemies. 
And now, many nations have gathered against you, who are saying: “Let her be defiled, and our eyes look on Zion.” 
They have not known the thoughts of YHWH, || Nor have they understood His counsel, || For He has gathered them as a sheaf into a threshing-floor. 
Arise, and thresh, O daughter of Zion, || For I make your horn iron, || And I make your hooves bronze, || And you have beaten small many peoples, || And I have devoted to YHWH their gain, || And their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth!
