Chapter 29.
“And in the seventh month, on the first of the month, you have a holy convocation; you do no servile work; it is a day of shouting to you; 
and you have prepared a burnt-offering for refreshing fragrance to YHWH: one bullock, a son of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
and their present of flour mixed with oil: three-tenth parts for the bullock, two-tenth parts for the ram, 
and one-tenth part for one lamb, for the seven lambs; 
and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you; 
apart from the burnt-offering of the month and its present, and the continual burnt-offering and its present, and their drink-offerings, according to their ordinance, for refreshing fragrance, a fire-offering to YHWH. 
And on the tenth of this seventh month you have a holy convocation, and you have humbled your souls; you do no work; 
and you have brought a burnt-offering near to YHWH, a refreshing fragrance: one bullock, a son of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year; they are perfect ones for you; 
and their present of flour mixed with oil: three-tenth parts for the bullock, two-tenth parts for one ram, 
a tenth—a tenth part for one lamb, for the seven lambs, 
one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, apart from the sin-offering of the atonements, and the continual burnt-offering and its present, and their drink-offerings. 
And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you have a holy convocation; you do no servile work; and you have celebrated a festival to YHWH for seven days, 
and have brought a burnt-offering near, a fire-offering of refreshing fragrance, to YHWH: thirteen bullocks, sons of the herd, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year; they are perfect ones; 
and their present of flour mixed with oil: three-tenth parts for one bullock, for the thirteen bullocks, two-tenth parts for one ram, for the two rams, 
and a tenth—a tenth part for one lamb, for the fourteen lambs; 
and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, its present, and its drink-offering. 
And on the second day: twelve bullocks, sons of the herd, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
and their present and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the sheep, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, and its present, and their drink-offerings. 
And on the third day: eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
and their present and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one goat for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, and its present, and its drink-offering. 
And on the fourth day: ten bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
their present and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, its present, and its drink-offering. 
And on the fifth day: nine bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
and their present and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one goat for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, and its present, and its drink-offering. 
And on the sixth day: eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
and their present and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one goat for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, its present, and its drink-offering. 
And on the seventh day: seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
and their present and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one goat for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, its present, and its drink-offering. 
On the eighth day you have a restraint; you do no servile work; 
and you have brought a burnt-offering near, a fire-offering of refreshing fragrance, to YHWH: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones; 
their present and their drink-offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, in their number, according to the ordinance; 
and one goat for a sin-offering, apart from the continual burnt-offering, and its present, and its drink-offering. 
You prepare these to YHWH in your appointed times—apart from your vows and your free-will offerings—for your burnt-offerings, and for your presents, and for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings.” 
And Moses speaks to the sons of Israel according to all that YHWH has commanded Moses.
