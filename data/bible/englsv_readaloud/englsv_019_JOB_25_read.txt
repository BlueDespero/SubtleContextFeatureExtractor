Job.
Chapter 25.
And Bildad the Shuhite answers and says: 
“The rule and fear are with Him, || Making peace in His high places. 
Is their any number to His troops? And on whom does His light not arise? 
And what? Is man righteous with God? And what? Is he pure—born of a woman? 
Behold—to the moon, and it does not shine, || And stars have not been pure in His eyes. 
How much less man—a grub, || And the son of man—a worm!”
