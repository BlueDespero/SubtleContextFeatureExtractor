Isaiah.
Chapter 46.
Bel has bowed down, Nebo is stooping, || Their idols have been for the beast and for livestock, || Your burdens are loaded, a burden to the weary. 
They have stooped, they have bowed together, || They have not been able to deliver the burden, || And have gone into captivity themselves. 
“Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, || And all the remnant of Israel, || Who are borne from the belly, || Who are carried from the womb, 
Even to old age, I am He, and to grey hairs I carry, || I made, and I bear, indeed, I carry and deliver. 
To whom do you liken Me, and make equal? And compare Me, that we may be like? 
They are pouring out gold from a bag, || And they weigh silver on the beam, || They hire a refiner, and he makes it a god, || They fall down, indeed, they bow themselves. 
They lift him up on the shoulder, || They carry him, and cause him to rest in his place, || And he stands, he does not move from his place, || Indeed, one cries to him, and he does not answer, || He does not save him from his adversity. 
Remember this, and show yourselves men, || Turn it back, O transgressors, to the heart. 
Remember former things of old, || For I am Mighty, and there is none else, || God—and there is none like Me. 
Declaring the latter end from the beginning, || And from of old that which has not been done, || Saying, My counsel stands, || And all My delight I do. 
Calling a ravenous bird from the east, || The man of My counsel from a far land, || Indeed, I have spoken, indeed, I bring it in, || I have formed it, indeed, I do it. 
Listen to Me, you mighty in heart, || Who are far from righteousness. 
I have brought My righteousness near, || It is not far off, || And My salvation—it does not linger, || And I have given salvation in Zion, || For Israel My glory!”
