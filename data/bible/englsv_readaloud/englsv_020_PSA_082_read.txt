Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A PSALM OF ASAPH. God has stood in the congregation of God, || He judges among the gods. 
Until when do you judge perversely? And lift up the face of the wicked? Selah. 
Judge the weak and fatherless, || Declare the afflicted and the poor righteous. 
Let the weak and needy escape, || Deliver them from the hand of the wicked. 
They did not know, nor do they understand, || They habitually walk in darkness, || All the foundations of earth are moved. 
I have said, “You are gods, || And sons of the Most High—all of you, 
But you die as man, and you fall as one of the heads.” 
Rise, O God, judge the earth, || For You have inheritance among all the nations!
