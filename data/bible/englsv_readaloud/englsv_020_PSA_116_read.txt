Psalms.
Chapter 116.
I have loved, because YHWH hears My voice, my supplication, 
Because He has inclined His ear to me, || And during my days I call. 
Cords of death have surrounded me, || And straits of Sheol have found me, || I find distress and sorrow. 
And in the Name of YHWH I call: Ah, now, O YHWH, deliver my soul, 
YHWH is gracious, and righteous, || Indeed, our God is merciful, 
YHWH is a preserver of the simple, || I was low, and He gives salvation to me. 
Return, O my soul, to your rest, || For YHWH has conferred benefits on you. 
For You have delivered my soul from death, || My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing. 
I habitually walk before YHWH || In the lands of the living. 
I have believed, for I speak, || I have been greatly afflicted. 
I said in my haste, “Every man is a liar.” 
What do I return to YHWH? All His benefits are on me. 
I lift up the cup of salvation, || And in the Name of YHWH I call. 
Let me complete my vows to YHWH, || Now, before all His people. 
Precious in the eyes of YHWH is the death of His saints. 
Ah, now, O YHWH, for I am Your servant; I am Your servant, son of Your handmaid; You have opened my bonds. 
I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks to You, || And in the Name of YHWH I call. 
Let me complete my vows to YHWH, || Now, before all His people, 
In the courts of the house of YHWH, || In your midst, O Jerusalem, praise YAH!
