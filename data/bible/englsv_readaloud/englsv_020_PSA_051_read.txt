Chapter 51.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID, IN THE COMING OF NATHAN THE PROPHET TO HIM WHEN HE HAS GONE IN TO BATHSHEBA. Favor me, O God, according to Your kindness, || According to the abundance of Your mercies, || Blot out my transgressions. 
Thoroughly wash me from my iniquity, || And cleanse me from my sin, 
For I know my transgressions, || And my sin is continually before me. 
Against You, You only, I have sinned, || And done evil in Your eyes, || So that You are righteous in Your words, || You are pure in Your judging. 
Behold, I have been brought forth in iniquity, || And my mother conceives me in sin. 
Behold, You have desired truth in the inward parts, || And in the hidden part You cause me to know Wisdom. 
You cleanse me with hyssop and I am clean, || Wash me, and I am whiter than snow. 
You cause me to hear joy and gladness, || You make bones You have bruised joyful. 
Hide Your face from my sin. And blot out all my iniquities. 
Create for me a clean heart, O God, || And renew a right spirit within me. 
Do not cast me forth from Your presence, || And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. 
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, || And a willing spirit sustains me. 
I teach transgressors Your ways, || And sinners return to You. 
Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, || My tongue sings of Your righteousness. 
O Lord, you open my lips, || And my mouth declares Your praise. 
For You do not desire sacrifice, or I give it, || You do not accept burnt-offering. 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, || A heart broken and bruised, O God, || You do not despise. 
Do good in Your good pleasure with Zion, || You build the walls of Jerusalem. 
Then You desire sacrifices of righteousness, || Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, || Then they offer bullocks on your altar!
