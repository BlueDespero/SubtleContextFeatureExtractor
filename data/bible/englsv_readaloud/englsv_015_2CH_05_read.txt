2 Chronicles.
Chapter 5.
And all the work that Solomon made for the house of YHWH is finished, and Solomon brings in the sanctified things of his father David, and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he has put among the treasures of the house of God. 
Then Solomon assembles the elderly of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH from the City of David—it is Zion. 
And all the men of Israel are assembled to the king in the celebration—it is the seventh month; 
and all the elderly of Israel come in, and the Levites lift up the Ark, 
and they bring up the Ark, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that are in the tent; the priests, the Levites, have brought them up; 
and King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who are convened to him before the Ark are sacrificing sheep and oxen that are not counted nor numbered from multitude. 
And the priests bring in the Ark of the Covenant of YHWH to its place, to the oracle of the house, to the Holy of Holies, to the place of the wings of the cherubim; 
and the cherubim are spreading out wings over the place of the Ark, and the cherubim cover over the Ark, and over its poles, from above; 
and they lengthen the poles, and the heads of the poles are seen out of the Ark on the front of the oracle, and they are not seen outside; and it is there to this day. 
There is nothing in the Ark but the two tablets that Moses gave in Horeb, where YHWH covenanted with the sons of Israel, in their going out from Egypt. 
And it comes to pass, in the going out of the priests from the holy place—for all the priests who are present have sanctified themselves, there is none to watch by divisions, 
and the Levites, the singers, to all of them, to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brothers, clothed in white linen, with cymbals, and with psalteries, and harps, are standing on the east of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests blowing with trumpets— 
indeed, it comes to pass, trumpeters and singers are as one, to sound with one voice—to praise and to give thanks to YHWH, and at the lifting up of the sound with trumpets, and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and at giving praise to YHWH, saying, “For He is good, for His kindness is for all time,” that the house is filled with a cloud—the house of YHWH, 
and the priests have not been able to stand to minister from the presence of the cloud, for the glory of YHWH has filled the house of God.
