Psalms.
Chapter 75.
TO THE OVERSEER. “DO NOT DESTROY.” A PSALM OF ASAPH. A SONG. We have given thanks to You, O God, || We have given thanks, and Your Name is near, || They have recounted Your wonders. 
When I receive an appointment, I judge uprightly. 
The earth and all its inhabitants are melted, || I have pondered its pillars. Selah. 
I have said to the boastful, “Do not be boastful,” || And to the wicked, “Do not raise up a horn.” 
Do not raise up your horn on high || (You speak with a stiff neck). 
For not from the east, or from the west, || Nor from the wilderness—is elevation. 
But God is judging, || This He makes low—and this He lifts up. 
For a cup is in the hand of YHWH, || And the wine has foamed, || It is full of mixture, and He pours out of it, || Surely wring out its dregs, || And all the wicked of the earth drink, 
And I declare it for all time, || I sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
And I cut off all horns of the wicked, || The horns of the righteous are exalted!
