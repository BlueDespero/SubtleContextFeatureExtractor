Psalms.
Chapter 96.
Sing to YHWH a new song, || Sing to YHWH all the earth. 
Sing to YHWH, bless His Name, || Proclaim His salvation from day to day. 
Declare His glory among nations, || His wonders among all the peoples. 
For YHWH is great, and greatly praised, || He is fearful over all gods. 
For all the gods of the peoples are nothing, || And YHWH made the heavens. 
Splendor and majesty are before Him, || Strength and beauty in His sanctuary. 
Ascribe to YHWH, O families of the peoples, || Ascribe to YHWH glory and strength. 
Ascribe to YHWH the glory of His Name, || Lift up a present and come into His courts. 
Bow yourselves to YHWH, || In the honor of holiness, || Be afraid of His presence, all the earth. 
Say among nations, “YHWH has reigned, || Also—the world is established, unmoved, || He judges the peoples in uprightness.” 
The heavens rejoice, and the earth is joyful, || The sea and its fullness roar. 
The field exults, and all that is in it, || Then all trees of the forest sing, 
Before YHWH, for He has come, || For He has come to judge the earth. He judges the world in righteousness, || And the peoples in His faithfulness!
