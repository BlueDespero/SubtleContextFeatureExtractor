Romans.
Chapter 13.
Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God, 
so that he who is setting himself against the authority, has resisted against God’s ordinance; and those resisting will receive judgment to themselves. 
For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and do you wish to not be afraid of the authority? Be doing that which is good, and you will have praise from it, 
for it is a servant of God to you for good; and if you may do that which is evil, be fearing, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil. 
For this reason it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience, 
for because of this you also pay tribute; for they are servants of God, on this very thing attending continually; 
render, therefore, to all their dues; to whom tribute, the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the fear; to whom honor, the honor. 
To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other—he has fulfilled law, 
for, “You will not commit adultery, You will not murder, You will not steal, You will not bear false testimony, You will not covet”; and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: “You will love your neighbor as yourself”; 
the love to the neighbor works no ill; the love, therefore, is the fullness of law. 
And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already is to be aroused out of sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed; 
the night advanced, and the day came near; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armor of the light; 
as in daytime, let us walk properly; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in promiscuity and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy; 
but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and take no forethought for the flesh—for desires.
