1 Chronicles.
Chapter 13.
And David consults with the heads of the thousands and of the hundreds, and with every leader, 
and David says to all the assembly of Israel, “If it is good to you, and it has broken forth from our God YHWH—we send to our brothers, those left in all the lands of Israel, and the priests and the Levites with them in the cities of their outskirts, and they are gathered to us, 
and we bring around the Ark of our God to us, for we did not seek Him in the days of Saul.” 
And all the assembly says to do so, for the thing is right in the eyes of all the people. 
And David assembles all Israel from Shihor of Egypt even to the entering in of Hamath, to bring in the Ark of God from Kirjath-Jearim, 
and David goes up, and all Israel, to Ba‘alah, to Kirjath-Jearim that belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the Ark of God, YHWH, inhabiting the cherubim, where the Name is called on. 
And they place the Ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio are leading the cart, 
and David and all Israel are playing before God, with all strength, and with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
And they come to the threshing-floor of Chidon, and Uzza puts forth his hand to seize the Ark, for the oxen were released, 
and the anger of YHWH is kindled against Uzza, and He strikes him, because that he has put forth his hand on the Ark, and he dies there before God. 
And it is displeasing to David, because YHWH has made a breach on Uzza, and one calls that place “Breach of Uzza” to this day. 
And David fears God on that day, saying, “How do I bring the Ark of God to me?” 
And David has not turned aside the Ark to himself, to the City of David, and turns it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 
And the Ark of God dwells with the household of Obed-Edom, in his house, three months, and YHWH blesses the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he has.
