Isaiah.
Chapter 64.
Did You not tear the heavens? You came down, || Mountains flowed from Your presence, 
(As fire kindles stubble—Fire causes water to boil), || To make Your Name known to Your adversaries, || Nations tremble from Your presence. 
In Your doing fearful things that we do not expect, || You came down, || Mountains flowed from Your presence. 
Even from antiquity men have not heard, || They have not given ear, || Eye has not seen a God except You, || He works for those waiting for Him. 
You have met with the rejoicer || And the doer of righteousness, || In Your ways they remember You, || Behold, You have been angry when we sin, || By them is continuance, and we are saved. 
And we are as unclean—all of us, || And all our righteous acts are as garments of menstruation; And we fade as a leaf—all of us. And our iniquities take us away as wind. 
And there is none calling on Your Name, || Stirring himself up to lay hold on You, || For You have hid Your face from us, || And You melt us away by our iniquities. 
And now, O YHWH, You are our Father, || We are the clay, and You are our Framer, || And the work of Your hand—all of us. 
Do not be angry, O YHWH, very severely, || Nor remember iniquity forever, || Behold, look attentively, we implore You, || We are all Your people. 
Your holy cities have been a wilderness, || Zion has been a wilderness, || Jerusalem a desolation. 
Our holy and our beautiful house, || Where our fathers praised You, || Has become burned with fire, || And all our desirable things have become a ruin. 
Do You refrain Yourself for these, YHWH? You are silent, and afflict us very severely!
