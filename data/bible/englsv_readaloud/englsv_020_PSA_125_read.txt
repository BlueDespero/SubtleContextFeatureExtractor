Psalms.
Chapter 125.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Those trusting in YHWH are as Mount Zion, || It is not moved—it abides for all time. 
Jerusalem! Mountains are around her, || And YHWH is around His people, || From now on—even for all time. 
For the rod of wickedness does not rest on the lot of the righteous, || That the righteous do not put forth their hands on iniquity. 
Do good, O YHWH, to the good, || And to the upright in their hearts. 
As for those turning to their crooked ways, || YHWH causes them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!
