1 Chronicles.
Chapter 18.
And it comes to pass after this, that David strikes the Philistines, and humbles them, and takes Gath and its small towns out of the hand of the Philistines; 
and he strikes Moab, and the Moabites are servants to David, bringing a present. 
And David strikes Hadarezer king of Zobah, at Hamath, in his going to establish his power by the Euphrates River, 
and David captures from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David utterly destroys all the chariots, and leaves of them only one hundred chariots. 
And Aram of Damascus comes to give help to Hadarezer king of Zobah, and David strikes twenty-two thousand men in Aram, 
and David puts garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans are for servants to David, carrying a present, and YHWH gives salvation to David wherever he has gone. 
And David takes the shields of gold that have been on the servants of Hadarezer, and brings them to Jerusalem; 
and from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David has taken very much bronze; with it Solomon has made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of bronze. 
And Tou king of Hamath hears that David has struck the whole force of Hadarezer king of Zobah, 
and he sends his son Hadoram to King David, to ask of him of peace, and to bless him, because that he has fought against Hadarezer and strikes him (for Hadarezer had been a man of wars with Tou); and with him were all kinds of vessels, of gold, and silver, and bronze; 
King David has also sanctified them to YHWH with the silver and the gold that he has taken from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 
And Abishai son of Zeruiah has struck Edom in the Valley of Salt—eighteen thousand, 
and he puts garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites are servants to David; and YHWH saves David wherever he has gone. 
And David reigns over all Israel, and he is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people, 
and Joab son of Zeruiah is over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud is remembrancer, 
and Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar are priests, and Shavsha is scribe, 
and Benaiah son of Jehoiada is over the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the chief sons of David are at the hand of the king.
