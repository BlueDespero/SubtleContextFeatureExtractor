Psalms.
Chapter 8.
TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE GITTITH. A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH, our Lord, || How majestic is Your Name in all the earth, || Who have set Your splendor on the heavens! 
From the mouths of infants and sucklings || You have founded strength, || Because of Your adversaries, || To still an enemy and a self-avenger. 
For I see Your heavens, a work of Your fingers, || The moon and stars that You established. 
What is man that You remember him? The son of man that You inspect him? 
You make him a little lower than the gods or God, || And surround him with glory and majesty. 
You cause him to rule || Over the works of Your hands, || You have placed all under his feet. 
Sheep and oxen, all of them, || And also beasts of the field, 
Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, || Passing through the paths of the seas! 
YHWH, our Lord, || How majestic is Your Name in all the earth!
