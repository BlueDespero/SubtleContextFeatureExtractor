Amos.
Chapter 6.
Woe to those secure in Zion, || And those confident on the mountain of Samaria, || The marked of the chief of the nations, || And the house of Israel has come to them. 
Pass over to Calneh and see, || And go there to Hamath the great, || And go down to Gath of the Philistines, || Are they better than these kingdoms? Is their border greater than your border? 
Who are putting away the day of evil, || And you bring the seat of violence near, 
Who are lying down on beds of ivory, || And are spread out on their couches, || And are eating lambs from the flock, || And calves from the midst of the stall, 
Who are taking part according to the stringed instrument, || Like David they invented for themselves instruments of music; 
Who are drinking with bowls of wine, || And anoint themselves with chief perfumes, || And have not been pained for the breach of Joseph. 
Therefore they now go at the head of the captives, || And the mourning-feast of stretched-out ones is turned aside. 
Lord YHWH has sworn by Himself, || A declaration of YHWH, God of Hosts: “I am abominating the excellence of Jacob, || And his high places I have hated, || And I have delivered up the city and its fullness.” 
And if there are left ten persons in one house, || It has come to pass—that they have died. 
And his loved one has lifted him up, even his burner, || To bring forth the bones from the house, || And he said to him who is in the sides of the house, || “Is there any yet with you?” And he said, “None,” || Then he said, “Hush! We must not make mention of the Name of YHWH.” 
For behold, YHWH is commanding, || And He has struck the great house with breaches, || And the little house with clefts. 
Do horses run on a rock? Does one plow it with oxen? For you have turned judgment to gall, || And the fruit of righteousness to wormwood. 
O you who are rejoicing at nothing, || Who are saying, “Have we not taken to ourselves horns by our strength?” 
“Surely, behold, I am raising a nation against you, O house of Israel,” || A declaration of YHWH, God of Hosts, || “And they have oppressed you from the coming in to Hamath, || To the stream of the desert.”
