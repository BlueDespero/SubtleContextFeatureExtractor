Psalms.
Chapter 147.
Praise YAH! For it is good to praise our God, || For pleasant—lovely is praise. 
YHWH is building Jerusalem, || He gathers the driven away of Israel. 
Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, || And is binding up their griefs. 
Appointing the number of the stars, || He gives names to all of them. 
Our Lord is great, and abundant in power, || There is no narration of His understanding. 
YHWH is causing the meek to stand, || Making the wicked low to the earth. 
Answer to YHWH with thanksgiving, || Sing to our God with a harp. 
Who is covering the heavens with clouds, || Who is preparing rain for the earth, || Who is causing grass to spring up on mountains, 
Giving to the beast its food, || To the young of the ravens that call. 
He does not delight in the might of the horse, || He is not pleased in the legs of a man. 
YHWH is pleased with those fearing Him, || With those waiting for His kindness. 
Glorify, O Jerusalem, YHWH, || Praise your God, O Zion. 
For He strengthened the bars of your gates, || He has blessed your sons in your midst. 
Who is making your border peace, || He satisfies you with the fat of wheat. 
Who is sending forth His saying on earth, || His word runs very speedily. 
Who is giving snow like wool, || He scatters hoarfrost as ashes. 
Casting forth His ice like morsels, || Who stands before His cold? 
He sends forth His word and melts them, || He causes His wind to blow—the waters flow. 
Declaring His words to Jacob, || His statutes and His judgments to Israel. 
He has not done so to any nation, || As for judgments, they have not known them. Praise YAH!
