Psalms.
Chapter 123.
A song of ascents. I Lift up my eyes to you, who are throned in the heavens. 
As the eyes of a servant turn to the hand of his master, or the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so do our eyes turn to the Lord our God, until he is gracious to us. 
Be gracious, be gracious to us, Lord. Scorn enough, and more, have we borne 
More than enough have we borne of derision from those at their ease, of scorn from those who are haughty.
