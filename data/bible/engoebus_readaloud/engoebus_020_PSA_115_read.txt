Psalms.
Chapter 115.
Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, for your kindness' and faithfulness' sake. 
Why should the heathen say, “Where is now their God?” 
Our God he is in heaven; whatever he wishes, he does. 
Their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands. 
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see. 
They have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell. 
They have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk: no sound comes from their throats. 
Their makers become like them, so do all who trust in them. 
O Israel, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. 
House of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. 
You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord he is their help and their shield. 
The Lord, mindful of us, will bless us: he will bless the house of Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron. 
He will bless those who fear the Lord, the small and the great together. 
May the Lord add to your numbers to you and to your children. 
Blessed be you of the Lord, creator of heaven and earth. 
The heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth has he given to people. 
The dead cannot praise the Lord, nor those who go down into silence. 
But we will bless the Lord from now and for evermore. Hallelujah.
