Psalms.
Chapter 75.
For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song. We praise you, God, we praise you: we would call on your name and declare your wonders. 
“At the time I choose, I will judge fairly. 
Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, it is I who keep steady her pillars.” Selah 
I say to the boasters, “Boast not”; to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn: 
lift not your horn on high, speak not boldly against the Rock.” 
For not from east nor west, not from desert nor mountains; 
but God himself is the judge, humbling one and exalting another. 
In the hand of the Lord is a cup foaming wine, richly spiced. Out of this he pours a draught, and all the wicked of earth must drain it down to the dregs. 
But I will rejoice forever, singing praise to the God of Jacob. 
I will hew all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the just shall be lifted.
