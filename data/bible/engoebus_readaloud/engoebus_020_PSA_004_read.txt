Psalms.
Chapter 4.
For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David. Answer my cry, God, my defender. Often from straits you have brought me to spacious places. So now show me your favor and hear my prayer. 
How long, you proud people, will my honor be stained by the slanders you love, and the lies that you follow? Selah 
See! The Lord has shown me his wonderful kindness: the Lord hears, when I call to him. 
Sin not in your anger: but speak in your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah 
Offer true sacrifice, trust in the Lord. 
Many are longing for fortune to smile. Lift upon us the light of your face. 
You have put in my heart, Lord, a deeper joy than was theirs who had corn and wine in abundance. 
So in peace I will lie down and sleep; for you, Lord, keep me safe.
