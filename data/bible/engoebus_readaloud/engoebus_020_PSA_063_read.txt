Psalms.
Chapter 63.
A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, my God, you, you do I seek: my heart thirsts for you, my body faints for you in a parched and waterless land. 
As I in the temple have seen you, beholding your power and your glory, 
for better than life is your kindness: my lips shall utter your praise. 
So, while I live, I will bless you, and lift up my hands in your name. 
As with marrow and fat am I feasted; with joyful lips I will praise you. 
I call you to mind on my bed, and muse on you in the night watches; 
for you have been my help, I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings. 
I cling close after you, your right hand holds me up. 
But those who seek after my life shall go down to the depths of the earth, 
given o'er to the power of the sword, or as prey for jackals to devour. 
But the king shall rejoice in God: all who own his allegiance will glory. For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.
