Psalms.
Chapter 91.
You whose home is the shelter of God Most High, whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty, 
can say to the Lord, “My refuge, my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.” 
For he saves you from fowler's snare, from deadly plague, 
he shelters you with his pinions, and under his wings you can hide. His truth will be a shield and buckler. 
You need not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 
nor the plague that stalks in darkness, nor the pestilence raging at noon. 
A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand: but it will not draw near to you. 
You will only look on with your eyes, and see how the wicked are punished. 
You have made the Lord your refuge, you have made the Most High your defence. 
You will never be met by misfortune, no plague will come near your tent, 
for he orders his angels to guard you, wherever you go. 
They will carry you with their hands, so you don't hurt your foot on a stone. 
You will trample down lions and snakes, tread on young lions and cobras. 
“Because of their love for me, I will deliver them, I will protect those who trust my name. 
I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble, bringing them forth into safety and honor. 
I will give them a life of many days, I will show them my salvation.”
