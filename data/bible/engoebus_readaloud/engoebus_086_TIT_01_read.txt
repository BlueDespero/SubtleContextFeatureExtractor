Paul's Letter to  Titus.
Chapter 1.
From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God's chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness 
— and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began, 
and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior. 
To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace. 
My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you. 
They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly. 
For a supervisor, as God's steward, ought to be of blameless character — not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making. 
Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined, 
holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught — so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it. 
For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision. 
They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain. 
It was a Cretan — one of their own prophets — who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true. 
Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, 
and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth. 
To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted. 
They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work.
