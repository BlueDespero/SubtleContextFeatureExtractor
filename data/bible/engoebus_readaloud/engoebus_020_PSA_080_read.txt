Psalms.
Chapter 80.
For the leader. On shoshannim, eduth. Of Asaph, a psalm. Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep; from your throne on the cherubs shine forth 
before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin. Stir up your mighty power, come to our help. 
God, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved. 
O Lord of hosts, how long is your anger to smoke, despite the prayer of your people? 
You have fed them with bread of tears, you have made them drink tears by the measure. 
The scorn of our neighbors you make us, the laughing-stock of our foes. 
God of hosts, restore us: show us the light of your face, so we may be saved. 
A vine out of Egypt you brought; you did drive out the nations, and plant her; 
in the ground you did clear she struck root, and she filled all the land. 
The shade of her covered the mountains, her branches the cedars of God. 
She sent forth her shoots to the sea, and her branches as far as the River. 
Why have you torn down her fences, and left her to be plucked at by all who pass by, 
to be gnawed by the boar from the forest, and devoured by the beasts of the field? 
O God of hosts, return: look down from heaven and see and visit this vine, and restore her 
the vine which your right hand has planted. 
She is burned with fire and cut down before your stern face they are perishing. 
Support the one you have chosen, the one you have raised for yourself; 
then from you we will never draw back. Preserve us, and we will call on your name. 
Lord, God of hosts, restore us: Show us the light of your face, so we may be saved.
