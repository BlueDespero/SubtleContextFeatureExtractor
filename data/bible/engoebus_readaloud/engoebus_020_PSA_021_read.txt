Psalms.
Chapter 21.
For the leader. A psalm of David. The king rejoices, Lord, in your might, how he exults because of your help! 
You have granted to him his heart's desire, you have not withheld his lips' request. Selah 
You came to meet him with rich blessings, you set on his head a golden crown. 
He asked you for life, you gave it — many long days, forever and ever. 
Great is his glory because of your help, honor and majesty you lay upon him. 
For you make him most blessed forever, you make him glad with the joy of your presence. 
For the king puts always his trust in the Lord; the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken. 
Your hand will reach all your foes, your right hand, all who hate you. 
You will make them like a furnace of fire, when you appear, Lord. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire will devour them. 
You will sweep their offspring from the earth, their children from humanity. 
When they scheme against you and hatch evil plots — they will fail. 
For you aim your bow at their faces, make them turn in flight. 
Be exalted, Lord, in your strength, to your might we shall sing and make music.
