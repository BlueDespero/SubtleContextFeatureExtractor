Psalms.
Chapter 70.
For the leader. Of David. For commemoration. Quickly, God, deliver me, hasten to help me, Lord. 
May those who are seeking my life, be ashamed and confounded. 
May those who delight in my hurt be defeated and brought to dishonor. 
But may all who seek after you rejoice and be glad in you. May all who love your salvation say, “Glory to God,” evermore. 
I am weak and needy: make haste, God, to me. You are my help and deliverer; Lord, don't delay.
