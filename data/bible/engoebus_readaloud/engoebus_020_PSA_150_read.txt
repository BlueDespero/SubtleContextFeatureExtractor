Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Hallelujah. Praise God in his holy place. Praise him in the sky, his stronghold. 
Praise him for his deeds of power. Praise him for his boundless greatness. 
Praise him with blast of horn; praise him with harp and lyre. 
Praise him with timbrel and dance; praise him with strings and pipe. 
Praise him with resounding cymbals, praise him with clashing cymbals. 
Let all that has breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
