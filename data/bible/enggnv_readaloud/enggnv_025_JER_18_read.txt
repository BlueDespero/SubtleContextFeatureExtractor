Jeremiah.
Chapter 18.
The worde which came to Ieremiah from the Lord, saying, 
Arise, and go downe into the potters house, and there shall I shewe thee my words. 
Then I went downe to the potters house, and behold, he wrought a worke on the wheeles. 
And the vessell that he made of clay, was broken in the hand of the potter. so he returned, and made it another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. 
Then the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying, 
O house of Israel, cannot I doe with you as this potter, sayth the Lord? beholde, as the clay is in the potters hande, so are you in mine hande, O house of Israel. 
I will speake suddenly against a nation or against a kingdome to plucke it vp, and to roote it out and to destroy it. 
But if this nation, against whom I haue pronounced, turne from their wickednesse, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring vpon them. 
And I wil speake suddenly concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome to builde it and to plant it. 
But if it do euill in my sight and heare not my voyce, I will repent of ye good that I thought to do for them. 
Speake thou nowe therefore vnto the men of Iudah, and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem, saying, Thus saith ye Lord, Behold, I prepare a plague for you, and purpose a thing against you: returne you therefore euery one from his euill way, and make your wayes and your workes good. 
But they sayde desperately, Surely wee will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe euery man after the stubburnnesse of his wicked heart. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord, Aske now among the heathen, who hath heard such thinges? the virgin of Israel hath done very filthily. 
Will a man forsake the snowe of Lebanon, which commeth from the rocke of the fielde? or shall the colde flowing waters, that come from another place, be forsaken? 
Because my people hath forgotten me, and haue burnt incense to vanitie, and their prophets haue caused them to stumble in their wayes from the auncient wayes, to walke in the pathes and way that is not troden, 
To make their land desolate and a perpetual derision, so that euery one that passeth thereby, shalbe astonished and wagge his head, 
I will scatter them with an East winde before the enemie: I will shewe them the backe, and not the face in the day of their destruction. 
Then sayde they, Come, and let vs imagine some deuice against Ieremiah: for the Lawe shall not perish from the Priest, nor counsell from the wise, nor the worde from the Prophet: come, and let vs smite him with the tongue, and let vs not giue heede to any of his words. 
Hearken vnto mee, O Lord, and heare the voyce of them that contend with me. 
Shall euill be recompensed for good? for they haue digged a pit for my soule: remember that I stood before thee, to speake good for the, and to turne away thy wrath from them. 
Therefore, deliuer vp their children to famine, and let them drop away by the force of the sworde, and let their wiues be robbed of their children, and be widowes: and let their husbands be put to death, and let their yong men be slayne by the sword in the battell. 
Let the crye bee heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring an hoste suddenly vpon them: for they haue digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feete. 
Yet Lord thou knowest al their counsel against me tendeth to death: forgiue not their iniquitie, neither put out their sinne from thy sight, but let them be ouerthrowen before thee: deale thus with them in the time of thine anger.
