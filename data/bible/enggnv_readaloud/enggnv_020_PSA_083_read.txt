Psalms.
Chapter 83.
A song, or Psalme committed to Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God: bee not still, and cease not, O God. 
For lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee, haue lifted vp the head. 
They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people, and haue consulted against thy secret ones. 
They haue said, Come and let vs cut them off from being a nation: and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance. 
For they haue consulted together in heart, and haue made a league against thee: 
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Agarims: 
Gebal and Ammon, and Amalech, the Philistims with the inhabitants of Tyrus: 
Asshur also is ioyned with them: they haue bene an arme to the children of Lot. Selah. 
Doe thou to them as vnto the Midianites: as to Sisera and as to Iabin at the riuer of Kishon. 
They perished at En-dor, and were dung for the earth. 
Make them, euen their princes like Oreb and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmuna. 
Which haue said, Let vs take for our possession the habitations of God. 
O my God, make them like vnto a wheele, and as the stubble before the winde. 
As the fire burneth the forest, and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire: 
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraide with thy storme. 
Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy Name, O Lord. 
Let them be confounded and troubled for euer: yea, let them be put to shame and perish, 
That they may knowe that thou, which art called Iehouah, art alone, euen the most High ouer all the earth.
