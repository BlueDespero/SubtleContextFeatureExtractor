Psalms.
Chapter 123.
A song of degrees. I lift vp mine eyes to thee, that dwellest in the heauens. 
Behold, as the eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a mayden vnto the hand of her mistres: so our eyes waite vpon the Lord our God vntil he haue mercie vpon vs. 
Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs: for we haue suffered too much contempt. 
Our soule is filled too full of ye mocking of the wealthy, and of the despitefulnes of the proude.
