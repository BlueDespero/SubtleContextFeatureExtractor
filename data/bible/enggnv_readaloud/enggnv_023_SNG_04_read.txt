Song of Solomon.
Chapter 4.
Behold, thou art faire, my loue: behold, thou art faire: thine eyes are like the doues: among thy lockes thine heare is like the flocke of goates, which looke downe from the mountaine of Gilead. 
Thy teeth are like a flocke of sheepe in good order, which go vp from the washing: which euery one bring out twinnes, and none is barren among them. 
Thy lippes are like a threede of scarlet, and thy talke is comely: thy temples are within thy lockes as a piece of a pomegranate. 
Thy necke is as the tower of Dauid builte for defence: a thousand shieldes hang therein, and all the targates of the strong men. 
Thy two breastes are as two young roes that are twinnes, feeding among the lilies. 
Vntill the day breake, and the shadowes flie away, I wil go into the mountaine of myrrhe and to the mountaine of incense. 
Thou art all faire, my loue, and there is no spot in thee. 
Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, euen with me from Lebanon, and looke from the toppe of Amanah, from the toppe of Shenir and Hermon, from the dennes of the lyons, and from the mountaines of the leopards. 
My sister, my spouse, thou hast wounded mine heart: thou hast wounded mine heart with one of thine eyes, and with a chaine of thy necke. 
My sister, my spouse, how faire is thy loue? howe much better is thy loue then wine? and the sauour of thine oyntments then all spices? 
Thy lippes, my spouse, droppe as honie combes: honie and milke are vnder thy tongue, and the sauoure of thy garments is as the sauoure of Lebanon. 
My sister my spouse is as a garden inclosed, as a spring shut vp, and a fountaine sealed vp. 
Thy plantes are as an orchard of pomegranates with sweete fruites, as camphire, spikenarde, 
Euen spikenarde, and saffran, calamus, and cynamon with all the trees of incense, myrrhe and aloes, with all the chiefe spices. 
O fountaine of the gardens, O well of liuing waters, and the springs of Lebanon. 
Arise, O North, and come O South, and blowe on my garden that the spices thereof may flow out: let my welbeloued come to his garden, and eate his pleasant fruite.
