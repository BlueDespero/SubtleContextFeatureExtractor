And the barres thereof shalbe put in the rings, the which barres shalbe vpon the two sides of the altar to beare it. 
Thou shalt make the altar holowe betweene the boardes: as God shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make it.

And thou shalt commande the children of Israel, that they bring vnto thee pure oyle oliue beaten, for the light, that the lampes may alway burne. 
In the Tabernacle of the Congregation without the vaile, which is before the Testimony, shall Aaron and his sonnes dresse them from euening to morning before the Lord, for a statute for euer vnto their generations, to be obserued by the children of Israel.
