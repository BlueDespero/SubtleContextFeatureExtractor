Psalms.
Chapter 112.
Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man, that feareth the Lord, and deliteth greatly in his commandements. 
His seede shall be mightie vpon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed. 
Riches and treasures shalbe in his house, and his righteousnesse endureth for euer. 
Vnto the righteous ariseth light in darkenes: he is merciful and full of copassion and righteous. 
A good man is mercifull and lendeth, and will measure his affaires by iudgement. 
Surely he shall neuer be moued: but the righteous shalbe had in euerlasting remembrance. 
He will not be afraide of euill tidings: for his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord. 
His heart is stablished: therefore he will not feare, vntill he see his desire vpon his enemies. 
He hath distributed and giuen to ye poore: his righteousnesse remaineth for euer: his horne shalbe exalted with glory. 
The wicked shall see it and be angrie: he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
