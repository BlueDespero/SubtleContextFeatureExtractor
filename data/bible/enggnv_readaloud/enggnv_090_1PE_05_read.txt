1 Peter.
Chapter 5.
The elders which are among you, I beseech which am also an elder, and a witnesse of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shalbe reueiled, 
Feede the flocke of God, which dependeth vpon you, caring for it not by constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde: 
Not as though ye were lords ouer Gods heritage, but that yee may bee ensamples to the flocke. 
And when that chiefe shepheard shall appeare, ye shall receiue an incorruptible crowne of glory. 
Likewise ye yonger, submit your selues vnto the elders, and submit your selues euery man, one to another: decke your selues inwardly in lowlinesse of minde: for God resisteth the proude, and giueth grace to the humble. 
Humble your selues therefore vnder the mightie hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 
Cast all your care on him: for he careth for you. 
Be sober, and watch: for your aduersarie the deuil as a roaring lyon walketh about, seeking whom he may deuoure: 
Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren which are in the world. 
And the God of all grace, which hath called vs vnto his eternall glory by Christ Iesus, after that ye haue suffered a litle, make you perfite, confirme, strengthen and stablish you. 
To him be glory and dominion for euer and euer, Amen. 
By Syluanus a faithfull brother vnto you, as I suppose, haue I written briefly, exhorting and testifying how that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye stand. 
The Church that is at Babylon elected together with you, saluteth you, and Marcus my sonne. 
Greete yee one another with the kisse of loue. Peace be with you all which are in Christ Iesus, Amen.
