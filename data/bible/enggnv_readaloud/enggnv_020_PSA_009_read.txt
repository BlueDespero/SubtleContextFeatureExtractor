Psalms.
Chapter 9.
To him that excelleth vpon Muth Laben. A Psalme of Dauid. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart: I will speake of all thy marueilous workes. 
I will bee glad, and reioyce in thee: I will sing praise to thy Name, O most High, 
For that mine enemies are turned backe: they shall fall, and perish at thy presence. 
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne, and iudgest right. 
Thou hast rebuked the heathen: thou hast destroyed the wicked: thou hast put out their name for euer and euer. 
O enemie, destructions are come to a perpetual end, and thou hast destroyed the cities: their memoriall is perished with them. 
But the Lord shall sit for euer: hee hath prepared his throne for iudgement. 
For he shall iudge the worlde in righteousnes, and shall iudge the people with equitie. 
The Lord also wil be a refuge for the poore, a refuge in due time, euen in affliction. 
And they that know thy Name, will trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not failed them that seeke thee. 
Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: shewe the people his workes. 
For whe he maketh inquisition for blood, hee remembreth it, and forgetteth not the complaint of the poore. 
Haue mercie vpon mee, O Lord: consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate mee, thou that liftest me vp from the gates of death, 
That I may shewe all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of Zion, and reioyce in thy saluation. 
The heathen are sunken downe in the pit that they made: in the nette that they hid, is their foote taken. 
The Lord is knowen by executing iudgement: the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne handes. Higgaion. Selah. 
The wicked shall turne into hell, and all nations that forget God. 
For the poore shall not bee alway forgotten: the hope of the afflicted shall not perish for euer. 
Vp Lord: let not man preuaile: let the heathen be iudged in thy sight. 
Put them in feare, O Lord, that the heathen may knowe that they are but men. Selah.
