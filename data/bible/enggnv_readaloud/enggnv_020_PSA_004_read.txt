Psalms.
Chapter 4.
To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare me when I call, O God of my righteousnes: thou hast set me at libertie, when I was in distresse: haue mercie vpon me and hearken vnto my prayer. 
O ye sonnes of men, howe long will yee turne my glory into shame, louing vanitie, and seeking lyes? Selah. 
For be ye sure that the Lord hath chosen to himselfe a godly man: the Lord will heare when I call vnto him. 
Tremble, and sinne not: examine your owne heart vpon your bed, and be still. Selah. 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousnes, and trust in the Lord. 
Many say, Who will shewe vs any good? but Lord, lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. 
Thou hast giuen mee more ioye of heart, then they haue had, when their wheate and their wine did abound. 
I will lay mee downe, and also sleepe in peace: for thou, Lord, onely makest me dwell in safetie.
