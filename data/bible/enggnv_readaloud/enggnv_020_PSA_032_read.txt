Psalms.
Chapter 32.
A Psalme of David to give instruction. Blessed is he whose wickednes is forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered. 
Blessed is the man, vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie, and in whose spirite there is no guile. 
When I helde my tongue, my bones consumed, or when I roared all the day, 
(For thine hand is heauie vpon me, day and night: and my moysture is turned into ye drought of summer. Selah) 
Then I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee, neither hid I mine iniquitie: for I thought, I will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne. Selah. 
Therefore shall euery one, that is godly, make his prayer vnto thee in a time, when thou mayest be founde: surely in the flood of great waters they shall not come neere him. 
Thou art my secret place: thou preseruest me from trouble: thou compassest me about with ioyfull deliuerance. Selah. 
I will instruct thee, and teache thee in the way that thou shalt goe, and I will guide thee with mine eye. 
Be ye not like an horse, or like a mule, which vnderstand not: whose mouthes thou doest binde with bit and bridle, least they come neere thee. 
Many sorowes shall come to the wicked: but he, that trusteth in the Lord, mercie shall compasse him. 
Be glad ye righteous, and reioyce in the Lord, and be ioyfull all ye, that are vpright in heart.
