Psalms.
Chapter 145.
A Psalme of David of Praise. O my God and King, I will extold thee, and will blesse thy Name for euer and euer. 
I will blesse thee dayly, and prayse thy Name for euer and euer. 
Great is the Lord, and most worthy to be praysed, and his greatnes is incomprehensible. 
Generation shall praise thy works vnto generation, and declare thy power. 
I wil meditate of the beautie of thy glorious maiestie, and thy wonderfull workes, 
And they shall speake of the power of thy fearefull actes, and I will declare thy greatnes. 
They shall breake out into the mention of thy great goodnes, and shall sing aloude of thy righteousnesse. 
The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great mercie. 
The Lord is good to all, and his mercies are ouer all his workes. 
All thy workes prayse thee, O Lord, and thy Saints blesse thee. 
They shewe the glory of thy kingdome, and speake of thy power, 
To cause his power to be knowen to the sonnes of men, and the glorious renoume of his kingdome. 
Thy kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and thy dominion endureth throughout all ages. 
The Lord vpholdeth all that fall, and lifteth vp all that are ready to fall. 
The eyes of all waite vpon thee, and thou giuest them their meate in due season. 
Thou openest thine hand, and fillest all things liuing of thy good pleasure. 
The Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his workes. 
The Lord is neere vnto all that call vpon him: yea, to all that call vpon him in trueth. 
He wil fulfill the desire of them that feare him: he also wil heare their cry, and wil saue them. 
The Lord preserueth all them that loue him: but he will destroy all the wicked. 
My mouth shall speake the prayse of the Lord, and all flesh shall blesse his holy Name for euer and euer.
