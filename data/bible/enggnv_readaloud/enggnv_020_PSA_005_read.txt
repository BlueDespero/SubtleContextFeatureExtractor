Psalms.
Chapter 5.
To him that excelleth upon Nehiloth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my wordes, O Lord: vnderstande my meditation. 
Hearken vnto the voyce of my crie, my King and my God: for vnto thee doe I pray. 
Heare my voyce in the morning, O Lord: for in the morning will I direct me vnto thee, and I will waite. 
For thou art not a God that loueth wickednes: neither shall euill dwell with thee. 
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all them that worke iniquitie. 
Thou shalt destroy them that speake lyes: the Lord will abhorre the bloodie man and deceitfull. 
But I wil come into thine house in the multitude of thy mercie: and in thy feare will I worship toward thine holy Temple. 
Leade me, O Lord, in thy righteousnes, because of mine enemies: make thy way plaine before my face. 
For no constancie is in their mouth: within, they are very corruption: their throte is an open sepulchre, and they flatter with their tongue. 
Destroy them, O God: let them fall from their counsels: cast them out for the multitude of their iniquities, because they haue rebelled against thee. 
And let all them that trust in thee, reioyce and triumph for euer, and couer thou them: and let them, that loue thy Name, reioyce in thee. 
For thou Lord wilt blesse the righteous, and with fauour wilt compasse him, as with a shielde.
