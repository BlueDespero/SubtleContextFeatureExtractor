Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A song of degrees. Blessed is euery one that feareth the Lord and walketh in his wayes. 
When thou eatest the labours of thine hands, thou shalt be blessed, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife shalbe as the fruitfull vine on the sides of thine house, and thy children like the oliue plantes round about thy table. 
Lo, surely thus shall the man be blessed, that feareth the Lord. 
The Lord out of Zion shall blesse thee, and thou shalt see the wealth of Ierusalem all the dayes of thy life. 
Yea, thou shalt see thy childrens children, and peace vpon Israel.
