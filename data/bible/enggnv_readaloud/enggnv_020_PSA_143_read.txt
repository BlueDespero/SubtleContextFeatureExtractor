Psalms.
Chapter 143.
A Psalme of David. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hearken vnto my supplication: answere me in thy trueth and in thy righteousnes. 
(And enter not into iudgement with thy seruant: for in thy sight shall none that liueth, be iustified) 
For the enemie hath persecuted my soule: he hath smitten my life downe to the earth: he hath layde me in the darkenes, as they that haue bene dead long agoe: 
And my spirit was in perplexitie in me, and mine heart within me was amased. 
Yet doe I remember the time past: I meditate in all thy workes, yea, I doe meditate in the workes of thine hands. 
I stretch forth mine hands vnto thee: my soule desireth after thee, as the thirstie land. Selah. 
Heare me speedily, O Lord, for my spirit fayleth: hide not thy face from me, els I shall be like vnto them that go downe into the pit. 
Let me heare thy louing kindenes in the morning, for in thee is my trust: shewe mee the way, that I should walke in, for I lift vp my soule vnto thee. 
Deliuer me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I hid me with thee. 
Teach me to doe thy will, for thou art my God: let thy good Spirit leade me vnto the land of righteousnes. 
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Names sake, and for thy righteousnesse bring my soule out of trouble. 
And for thy mercy slay mine enemies, and destroy all them that oppresse my soule: for I am thy seruant.
