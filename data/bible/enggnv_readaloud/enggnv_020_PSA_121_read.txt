Psalms.
Chapter 121.
A song of degrees. I will lift mine eyes vnto the mountaines, from whence mine helpe shall come. 
Mine helpe commeth from the Lord, which hath made the heauen and the earth. 
He wil not suffer thy foote to slippe: for he that keepeth thee, will not slumber. 
Beholde, he that keepeth Israel, wil neither slumber nor sleepe. 
The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shadow at thy right hand. 
The sunne shall not smite thee by day, nor the moone by night. 
The Lord shall preserue thee from all euil: he shall keepe thy soule. 
The Lord shall preserue thy going out, and thy comming in from henceforth and for euer.
