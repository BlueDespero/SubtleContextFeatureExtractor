Psalms.
Chapter 99.
The Lord reigneth, let the people tremble: he sitteth betweene the Cherubims, let the earth be moued. 
The Lord is great in Zion, and he is high aboue all the people. 
They shall prayse thy great and fearefull Name (for it is holy) 
And the Kings power, that loueth iudgement: for thou hast prepared equitie: thou hast executed iudgement and iustice in Iaakob. 
Exalt the Lord our God, and fall downe before his footestoole: for he is holy. 
Moses and Aaron were among his Priests, and Samuel among such as call vpon his Name: these called vpon the Lord, and he heard them. 
Hee spake vnto them in the cloudie pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the Lawe that he gaue them. 
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou wast a fauourable God vnto them, though thou didst take vengeance for their inuentions. 
Exalt the Lord our God, and fall downe before his holy Mountaine: for the Lord our God is holy.
