Hosea.
Chapter 6.
Come, and let vs returne to the Lord: for he hath spoyled, and he will heale vs: he hath wounded vs, and he will binde vs vp. 
After two dayes will he reuiue vs, and in the third day he will raise vs vp, and we shall liue in his sight. 
Then shall we haue knowledge, and indeuour our selues to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come vnto vs as the raine, and as the latter raine vnto the earth. 
O Ephraim, what shall I doe vnto thee? O Iudah, how shall I intreate thee? for your goodnesse is as a morning cloude, and as the morning dewe it goeth away. 
Therefore haue I cut downe by the Prophets: I haue slaine them by the wordes of my mouth, and thy iudgements were as the light that goeth forth. 
For I desired mercie, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then burnt offrings. 
But they like men haue transgressed the couenant: there haue they trespassed against me. 
Gilead is a citie of them that worke iniquitie, and is polluted with blood. 
And as the eues waite for a man, so the companie of Priestes murder in the way by consent: for they worke mischiefe. 
I haue seene vileny in the house of Israel: there is ye whoredome of Ephraim: Israel is defiled. 
Yea, Iudah hath set a plant for thee, whiles I woulde returne ye captiuitie of my people.
