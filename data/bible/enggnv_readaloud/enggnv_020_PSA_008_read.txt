Psalms.
Chapter 8.
To him that excelleth on Gittith. A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the worlde! which hast set thy glory aboue the heauens. 
Out of the mouth of babes and suckelings hast thou ordeined strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemie and the auenger. 
When I beholde thine heauens, euen the workes of thy fingers, the moone and the starres which thou hast ordeined, 
What is man, say I, that thou art mindefull of him? and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him? 
For thou hast made him a little lower then God, and crowned him with glory and worship. 
Thou hast made him to haue dominion in the workes of thine hands: thou hast put all things vnder his feete: 
All sheepe and oxen: yea, and the beastes of the fielde: 
The foules of the ayre, and the fish of the sea, and that which passeth through the paths of the seas. 
O Lord our Lord, howe excellent is thy Name in all the world!
