Psalms.
Chapter 15.
A Psalme of Dauid. Lord, who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thine holy Mountaine? 
He that walketh vprightly and worketh righteousnes, and speaketh the trueth in his heart. 
He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth euill to his neighbour, nor receiueth a false report against his neighbour. 
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that feare the Lord: he that sweareth to his owne hinderance and changeth not. 
He that giueth not his money vnto vsurie, nor taketh reward against the innocent: hee that doeth these things, shall neuer be moued.
