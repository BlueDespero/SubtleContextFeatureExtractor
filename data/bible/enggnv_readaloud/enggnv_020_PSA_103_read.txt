Psalms.
Chapter 103.
A Psalme of David. My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and all that is within me, prayse his holy Name. 
My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefites. 
Which forgiueth all thine iniquitie, and healeth all thine infirmities. 
Which redeemeth thy life from the graue, and crowneth thee with mercy and compassions. 
Which satisfieth thy mouth with good things: and thy youth is renued like the eagles. 
The Lord executeth righteousnes and iudgement to all that are oppressed. 
He made his wayes knowen vnto Moses, and his workes vnto the children of Israel. 
The Lord is full of compassion and mercie, slowe to anger and of great kindnesse. 
He will not alway chide, neither keepe his anger for euer. 
He hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities. 
For as high as the heauen is aboue ye earth, so great is his mercie toward them that feare him. 
As farre as the East is from the West: so farre hath he remooued our sinnes from vs. 
As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him. 
For he knoweth whereof we be made: he remembreth that we are but dust. 
The dayes of man are as grasse: as a flowre of the fielde, so florisheth he. 
For the winde goeth ouer it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall knowe it no more. 
But the louing kindnesse of the Lord endureth for euer and euer vpon them that feare him, and his righteousnes vpon childrens children, 
Vnto them that keepe his couenant, and thinke vpon his commandements to doe them. 
The Lord hath prepared his throne in heauen, and his Kingdome ruleth ouer all. 
Prayse the Lord, ye his Angels, that excell in strength, that doe his commandement in obeying the voyce of his worde. 
Prayse the Lord, all ye his hostes, ye his seruants that doe his pleasure. 
Prayse the Lord, all ye his workes, in all places of his dominion: my soule, prayse thou the Lord.
