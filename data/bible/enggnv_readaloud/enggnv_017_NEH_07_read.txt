Nehemiah.
Chapter 7.
Nowe when the wall was builded, and I had set vp the doores, and the porters, and the singers and the Leuites were appointed, 
Then I commanded my brother Hanani and Hananiah the prince of the palace in Ierusalem (for he was doubtlesse a faithfull man, and feared God aboue many) 
And I saide vnto them, Let not the gates of Ierusalem be opened, vntill the heate of the sunne: and while they stande by, let them shut the doores, and make them fast: and I appointed wardes of the inhabitants of Ierusalem, euery one in his warde, and euery one ouer against his house. 
Nowe the citie was large and great, but the people were few therein, and the houses were not buylded.
