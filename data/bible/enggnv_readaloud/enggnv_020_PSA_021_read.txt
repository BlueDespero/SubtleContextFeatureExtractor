Psalms.
Chapter 21.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The King shall reioyce in thy strength, O Lord: yea how greatly shall he reioyce in thy saluation! 
Thou hast giuen him his hearts desire, and hast not denyed him the request of his lips. Selah. 
For thou diddest preuent him with liberall blessings, and didest set a crowne of pure gold vpon his head. 
He asked life of thee, and thou gauest him a long life for euer and euer. 
His glory is great in thy saluation: dignitie and honour hast thou laid vpon him. 
For thou hast set him as blessings for euer: thou hast made him glad with the ioy of thy countenance. 
Because the King trusteth in the Lord, and in the mercie of the most High, he shall not slide. 
Thine hand shall finde out all thine enemies, and thy right hand shall finde out them that hate thee. 
Thou shalt make them like a fierie ouen in time of thine anger: the Lord shall destroy them in his wrath, and the fire shall deuoure them. 
Their fruite shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seede from the children of men. 
For they intended euill against thee, and imagined mischiefe, but they shall not preuaile. 
Therefore shalt thou put them aparte, and the strings of thy bowe shalt thou make readie against their faces. 
Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy strength: so will we sing and prayse thy power.
