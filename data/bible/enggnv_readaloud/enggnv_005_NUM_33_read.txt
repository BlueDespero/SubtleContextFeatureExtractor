Nowe they departed from Rameses the first moneth, euen the fifteenth day of the first moneth, on the morowe after the Passeouer: and the children of Israel went out with an hie hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.

And they remoued from Ezion-gaber, and pitched in the wildernesse of Zin, which is Kadesh. 
And they remooued from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. 
(And Aaron the Priest went vp into mount Hor, at the commandement of the Lord, and died there, in the fourtieth yeere after the children of Israel were come out of the lande of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth moneth. 
And Aaron was an hundreth, and three and twentie yeere olde, when hee dyed in mount Hor. 
And King Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the South of the land of Canaan, heard of the comming of the children of Israel) 
And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 
And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 
And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 
And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Iie-abarim, in the borders of Moab. 
And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. 
And they remooued from Dibon-gad, and lay in Almon-diblathaim. 
And they remooued from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountaines of Abarim before Nebo. 
And they departed from the mountaines of Abarim, and pitched in the plaine of Moab, by Iorden toward Iericho. 
And they pitched by Iorden, from Bethieshimoth vnto Abel-shittim in the playne of Moab. 
And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the playne of Moab, by Iorden towarde Iericho, saying, 
Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye are come ouer Iorden to enter into the land of Canaan, 
Ye shall then driue out all the inhabitants of the land before you, and destroy all their pictures, and breake asunder all their images of metall, and plucke downe all their hie places. 
And ye shall possesse the lande and dwell therein: for I haue giue you ye land to possesse it. 
And ye shall inherite the land by lot according to your families: to the more yee shall giue more inheritance, and to the fewer the lesse inheritance. Where the lot shall fall to any man, that shall be his: according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherite. 
But if ye will not driue out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those which yee let ramaine of them, shalbe prickes in your eyes, and thornes in your sides, and shall vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
Moreouer, it shall come to passe, that I shall doe vnto you, as I thought to do vnto them.
