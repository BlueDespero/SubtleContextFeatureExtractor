Psalms.
Chapter 23.
A Psalme of David. The Lord is my shepheard, I shall not want. 
He maketh me to rest in greene pasture, and leadeth me by the still waters. 
He restoreth my soule, and leadeth me in the paths of righteousnesse for his Names sake. 
Yea, though I should walke through the valley of the shadowe of death, I will feare no euill: for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staffe, they comfort me. 
Thou doest prepare a table before me in the sight of mine aduersaries: thou doest anoynt mine head with oyle, and my cuppe runneth ouer. 
Doubtlesse kindnesse and mercie shall follow me all the dayes of my life, and I shall remaine a long season in the house of the Lord.
