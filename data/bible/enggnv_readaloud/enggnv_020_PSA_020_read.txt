Psalms.
Chapter 20.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord heare thee in the day of trouble: the name of ye God of Iaakob defend thee: 
Send thee helpe from the Sanctuarie, and strengthen thee out of Zion. 
Let him remember all thine offerings, and turne thy burnt offerings into asshes. Selah: 
And graunt thee according to thine heart, and fulfill all thy purpose: 
That we may reioyce in thy saluation, and set vp the banner in the Name of our God, when the Lord shall performe all thy petitions. 
Now know I that the Lord will helpe his anointed, and will heare him from his Sanctuarie, by the mightie helpe of his right hand. 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the Name of ye Lord our God. 
They are brought downe and fallen, but we are risen, and stand vpright. 
Saue Lord: let the King heare vs in the day that we call.
