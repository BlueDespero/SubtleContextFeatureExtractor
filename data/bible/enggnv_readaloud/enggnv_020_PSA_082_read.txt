Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A Psalme committed to Aspah. God standeth in the assemblie of gods: hee iudgeth among gods. 
How long wil ye iudge vniustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
Doe right to the poore and fatherlesse: doe iustice to the poore and needie. 
Deliuer the poore and needie: saue them from the hand of the wicked. 
They knowe not and vnderstand nothing: they walke in darkenes, albeit all the foundations of the earth be mooued. 
I haue said, Ye are gods, and ye all are children of the most High. 
But ye shall die as a man, and yee princes, shall fall like others. 
O God, arise, therefore iudge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherite all nations.
