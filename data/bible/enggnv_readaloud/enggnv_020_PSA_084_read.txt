Psalms.
Chapter 84.
To him that excelleth upon Gittith. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. O Lord of hostes, howe amiable are thy Tabernacles! 
My soule longeth, yea, and fainteth for the courtes of the Lord: for mine heart and my flesh reioyce in the liuing God. 
Yea, the sparrowe hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for her, where she may lay her yong: euen by thine altars, O Lord of hostes, my King and my God. 
Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will euer praise thee. Selah. 
Blessed is the man, whose strength is in thee, and in whose heart are thy wayes. 
They going through the vale of Baca, make welles therein: the raine also couereth the pooles. 
They goe from strength to strength, till euery one appeare before God in Zion. 
O Lord God of hostes, heare my prayer: hearken, O God of Iaakob. Selah. 
Beholde, O God, our shielde, and looke vpon the face of thine Anointed. 
For a day in thy courtes is better then a thousand other where: I had rather be a doore keeper in the House of my God, then to dwell in the Tabernacles of wickednesse. 
For the Lord God is the sunne and shielde vnto vs: the Lord will giue grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walke vprightly. 
O Lord of hostes, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
