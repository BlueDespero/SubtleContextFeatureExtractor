Psalms.
Chapter 60.
To him that excelleth upon Shushan Eduth, or Michtam. A Psalme of David to teach. When he fought against Aram Naharaim, and against Aram Zobah, when Joab returned and slew twelve thousand Edomites in the salt valley. O God, thou hast cast vs out, thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene angry, turne againe vnto vs. 
Thou hast made the land to tremble, and hast made it to gape: heale the breaches thereof, for it is shaken. 
Thou hast shewed thy people heauy things: thou hast made vs to drinke the wine of giddines. 
But now thou hast giuen a banner to them that feare thee, that it may be displayed because of thy trueth. Selah. 
That thy beloued may be deliuered, helpe with thy right hand and heare me. 
God hath spoken in his holines: therefore I will reioyce: I shall deuide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth. 
Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iudah is my lawgiuer. 
Moab shalbe my wash pot: ouer Edom will I cast out my shoe: Palestina shew thy selfe ioyfull for me. 
Who will leade me into the strong citie? who will bring me vnto Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadest cast vs off, and didest not go forth, O God, with our armies? 
Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man. 
Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall tread downe our enemies.
