Psalms.
Chapter 131.
A song of degrees or Psalme of David. Lord, mine heart is not hautie, neither are mine eyes loftie, neither haue I walked in great matters and hid from me. 
Surely I haue behaued my selfe, like one wained from his mother, and kept silence: I am in my selfe as one that is wained. 
Let Israel waite on the Lord from hencefoorth and for euer.
