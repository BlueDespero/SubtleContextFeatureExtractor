Psalms.
Chapter 25.
A Psalme of David. Unto thee, O Lord, lift I vp my soule. 
My God, I trust in thee: let me not be confounded: let not mine enemies reioyce ouer mee. 
So all that hope in thee, shall not be ashamed: but let them be confounded, that transgresse without cause. 
Shew me thy waies, O Lord, and teache me thy paths. 
Leade me foorth in thy trueth, and teache me: for thou art the God of my saluation: in thee doe I trust all the day. 
Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy louing kindnesse: for they haue beene for euer. 
Remember not the sinnes of my youth, nor my rebellions, but according to thy kindenesse remember thou me, euen for thy goodnesse sake, O Lord. 
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teache sinners in the way. 
Them that be meeke, will hee guide in iudgement, and teach the humble his way. 
All the pathes of the Lord are mercie and trueth vnto such as keepe his couenant and his testimonies. 
For thy Names sake, O Lord, be merciful vnto mine iniquitie, for it is great. 
What man is he that feareth the Lord? him wil he teache the way that hee shall chuse. 
His soule shall dwell at ease, and his seede shall inherite the land. 
The secrete of the Lord is reueiled to them, that feare him: and his couenant to giue them vnderstanding. 
Mine eyes are euer towarde the Lord: for he will bring my feete out of the net. 
Turne thy face vnto mee, and haue mercie vpon me: for I am desolate and poore. 
The sorowes of mine heart are enlarged: drawe me out of my troubles. 
Looke vpon mine affliction and my trauel, and forgiue all my sinnes. 
Beholde mine enemies, for they are manie, and they hate me with cruell hatred. 
Keepe my soule, and deliuer me: let me not be confounded, for I trust in thee. 
Let mine vprightnes and equitie preserue me: for mine hope is in thee. 
Deliuer Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
