Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heauen: prayse ye him in the high places. 
Prayse ye him, all ye his Angels: praise him, all his armie. 
Prayse ye him, sunne and moone: prayse ye him all bright starres. 
Prayse ye him, heauens of heauens, and waters, that be aboue the heauens. 
Let them prayse the Name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were created. 
And he hath established them for euer and euer: he hath made an ordinance, which shall not passe. 
Prayse ye the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all depths: 
Fire and hayle, snowe and vapours, stormie winde, which execute his worde: 
Mountaines and all hils, fruitfull trees and all ceders: 
Beasts and all cattell, creeping things and fethered foules: 
Kings of the earth and all people, princes and all iudges of the worlde: 
Yong men and maidens, also olde men and children: 
Let them prayse the Name of the Lord: for his Name onely is to be exalted, and his prayse aboue the earth and the heauens. 
For he hath exalted the horne of his people, which is a prayse for all his Saintes, euen for the children of Israel, a people that is neere vnto him. Prayse ye the Lord.
