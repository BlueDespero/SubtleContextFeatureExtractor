THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO TITUS.
Chapter 1.
Paul a seruaunt of God, and an Apostle of Iesus Christ, according to the faith of Gods elect, and the acknowledging of the trueth, which is according vnto godlines, 
Vnto the hope of eternall life, which God that cannot lie, hath promised before the world began: 
But hath made his worde manifest in due time through the preaching, which is committed vnto me, according to the commandement of God our Sauiour: 
To Titus my naturall sonne according to the common faith, Grace, mercie and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ our Sauiour. 
For this cause left I thee in Creta, that thou shouldest continue to redresse the thinges that remaine, and shouldest ordeine Elders in euery citie, as I appointed thee, 
If any be vnreproueable, the husband of one wife, hauing faithfull children, which are not slandered of riot, neither are disobedient. 
For a Bishop must bee vnreproueable, as Gods steward, not froward, not angrie, not giuen to wine, no striker, not giuen to filthie lucre, 
But harberous, one that loueth goodnesse, wise, righteous, holy, temperate, 
Holding fast that faithfull worde according to doctrine, that he also may bee able to exhort with wholesome doctrine, and conuince them that say against it. 
For there are many disobedient and vaine talkers and deceiuers of mindes, chiefly they of the Circumcision, 
Whose mouthes must bee stopped, which subuert whole houses, teaching things, which they ought not, for filthie lucres sake. 
One of themselues, euen one of their owne prophets said, The Cretians are alwaies liars, euill beastes, slowe bellies. 
This witnesse is true: wherefore conuince them sharply, that they may be sound in ye faith, 
And not taking heede to Iewish fables and commandements of men, that turne away from the trueth. 
Vnto the pure are all things pure, but vnto them that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure, but euen their mindes and consciences are defiled. 
They professe that they know God, but by works they deny him, and are abominable and disobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.
