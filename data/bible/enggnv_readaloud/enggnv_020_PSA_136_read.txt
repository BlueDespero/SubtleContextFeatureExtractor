As the sunne to rule the day: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
The moone and the starres to gouerne the night: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
Which smote Egypt with their first borne, (for his mercie endureth for euer) 
And brought out Israel from among them (for his mercie endureth for euer) 
With a mightie hande and stretched out arme: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
Which deuided the red Sea in two partes: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
And made Israel to passe through the mids of it: for his mercie endureth for euer:

And gaue their land for an heritage: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
Euen an heritage vnto Israel his seruant: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
Which remembred vs in our base estate: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
And hath rescued vs from our oppressours: for his mercie endureth for euer: 
Which giueth foode to all flesh: for his mercie endureth for euer. 
Praise ye the God of heauen: for his mercie endureth for euer.
