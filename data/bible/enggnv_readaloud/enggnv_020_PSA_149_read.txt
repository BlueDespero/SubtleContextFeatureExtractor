Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise ye the Lord. Sing ye vnto the Lord a newe song: let his prayse be heard in the Congregation of Saints. 
Let Israel reioyce in him that made him, and let ye children of Zion reioyce in their King. 
Let them prayse his Name with the flute: let them sing prayses vnto him with the timbrell and harpe. 
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: he will make the meeke glorious by deliuerance. 
Let ye Saints be ioyfull with glorie: let them sing loud vpon their beddes. 
Let the high Actes of God bee in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hands, 
To execute vengeance vpon the heathen, and corrections among the people: 
To binde their Kings in chaines, and their nobles with fetters of yron, 
That they may execute vpon them the iudgement that is written: this honour shall be to all his Saintes. Prayse ye the Lord.
