Psalms.
Chapter 120.
A song of degrees. I called vnto the Lord in my trouble, and hee heard me. 
Deliuer my soule, O Lord, from lying lippes, and from a deceitfull tongue. 
What doeth thy deceitfull tongue bring vnto thee? or what doeth it auaile thee? 
It is as the sharpe arrowes of a mightie man, and as the coales of iuniper. 
Woe is to me that I remaine in Meschech, and dwell in the tentes of Kedar. 
My soule hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
I seeke peace, and when I speake thereof, they are bent to warre.
