Genesis [Origin].
Chapter 19.
The two angels came to Sodom Burning at evening. Lot Veil, Covering sat in the gate of Sodom Burning. Lot Veil, Covering saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, 
and he said, “See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.” They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.” 
He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked matzah ·unleavened bread·, and they ate. 
But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom Burning, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. 
They called to Lot Veil, Covering, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.” 
Lot Veil, Covering went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him. 
He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly. 
See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.” 
They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot Veil, Covering, and came near to break the door. 
But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot Veil, Covering into the house to them, and shut the door. 
They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 
The men said to Lot Veil, Covering, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place: 
for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Adonai that Adonai has sent us to destroy it.” 
Lot Veil, Covering went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Adonai will destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. 
When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot Veil, Covering, saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.” 
But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, Adonai being merciful to him; and they took him out, and set him outside of the city. 
It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!” 
Lot Veil, Covering said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord. 
See now, your servant has found chen ·grace· in your sight, and you have magnified your cheshed ·loving-kindness·, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die. 
See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little town. Oh let me escape there, is not it a little one?, and there I will be safe.” (4) 
He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 
Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar Small. 
The sun had risen on the earth when Lot Veil, Covering came to Zoar Small. 
Then Adonai caused sulfur and fire to rain down upon Sodom Burning and Gomorrah Rebellious people, Tyrants from Adonai out of the sky. 
He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground. 
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
Abraham Father of a multitude got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Adonai . 
He looked toward Sodom Burning and Gomorrah Rebellious people, Tyrants, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
When God destroyed the 'Ieyr HaKikar Cities of the Round, God remembered Abraham Father of a multitude, and sent Lot Veil, Covering out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot Veil, Covering lived. 
Lot Veil, Covering went up out of Zoar Small, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar Small. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. 
The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth. 
Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” 
They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” 
They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up. 
Thus both of Lot Veil, Covering’s daughters were with child by their father. 
The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab From father. He is the father of the Moabites Descendants of From father to this day. 
The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi Son of my people. He is the father of the children of Ammon Tribal people to this day.
