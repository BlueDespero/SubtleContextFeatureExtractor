Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 110.
Adonai says to adoni my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” 
Adonai will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking. Rule among your enemies. 
Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth. 
Adonai has sworn, and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Malki-Tzedek My king Righteousness.” 
The Lord is at your right hand. He will crush kings in the day of his wrath. 
He will judge among the nations. He will heap up dead bodies. He will crush the ruler of the whole earth. 
He will drink of the brook on the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
