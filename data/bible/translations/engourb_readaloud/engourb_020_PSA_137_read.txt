Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 137.
By the rivers of Babylon Confusion, there we sat down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion Mountain ridge, Marking. 
On the willows in that land, we hung up our harps. 
For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: “Sing us one of the songs of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking!” 
How can we sing Adonai ’s song in a foreign land? 
If I forget you, Jerusalem City of peace, let my right hand forget its skill. 
Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you; if I don’t prefer Jerusalem City of peace above my chief joy. 
Remember, Adonai , against the children of Edom Red, the day of Jerusalem City of peace; who said, “Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!” 
Daughter of Babylon Confusion, doomed to destruction, he will be happy who rewards you, as you have served us. 
Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
