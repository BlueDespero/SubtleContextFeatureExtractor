Isaiah / Yesha'yahu.
Chapter 12.
In that day you will say, “I will give thanks to you, Adonai ; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me. 
Behold, God is my yishu'ah ·salvation·. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Adonai , is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation.” 
Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of yishu'ah ·salvation·. 
In that day you will say, “Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai ! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted! 
Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai , for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth! 
Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking; for the haKadosh Isra'el the Holy One of God prevails is great among you!”
