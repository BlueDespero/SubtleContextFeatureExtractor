Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 146.
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise Adonai , my soul. 
While I live, I will praise Adonai . I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to my God as long as I exist. 
Don’t put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom there is no help. 
His spirit departs, and he teshuvah ·completely returns· to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish. 
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob Supplanter for his help, whose hope is in Adonai , his God: 
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever; 
who executes mishpat ·justice· for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. Adonai frees the prisoners. 
Adonai opens the eyes of the blind. Adonai raises up those who are bowed down. Adonai 'ahav ·affectionately loves· the upright. 
Adonai preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down. 
Adonai will reign forever; your God, O Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, to all generations. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
