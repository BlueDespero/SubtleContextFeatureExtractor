Exodus / Sh'mot.
Chapter 11.
Adonai said to Moses Drawn out, “Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt Abode of slavery; afterwards he will surely divorce you and let you go. When he casts you out, he will surely divorce you out altogether. 
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.” 
Adonai gave the people chen ·grace· in the sight of the Egyptians people from Abode of slavery. Moreover the man Moses Drawn out was very great in the land of Egypt Abode of slavery, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people. (4) 
Moses Drawn out said, “This is what Adonai says: ‘About midnight I will go out into the middle of Egypt Abode of slavery, 
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt Abode of slavery shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock. 
There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt Abode of slavery, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more. 
But against any of the children of Israel God prevails a dog won’t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that Adonai makes a distinction between the Egyptians people from Abode of slavery and Israel God prevails. 
All these servants of yours will come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, “Get out, with all the people who follow you;” and after that I will go out.’” He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. 
Adonai said to Moses Drawn out, “Pharaoh won’t sh'ma ·hear obey· you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt Abode of slavery.” 
Moses Drawn out and Aaron Light-bringer did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Adonai hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel God prevails go out of his land.
