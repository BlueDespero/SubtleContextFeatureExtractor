Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 4.
Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and sh'ma ·hear obey· my prayer. 
You sons of men, how long shall my kavod ·weighty glory· be turned into dishonor? Will you 'ahav ·affectionately love· vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude· 
But know that Adonai has set apart for himself him who is godly: Adonai will sh'ma ·hear obey· when I call to him. 
You can be angry, but don’t sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude· 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Adonai . 
Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Adonai , let the light of your face shine on us. 
You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. 
In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you, Adonai alone, make me live in safety.
