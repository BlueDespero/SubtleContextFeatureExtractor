Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 111.
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
Adonai ’s works are great, pondered by all those who delight in them. 
His work is honor and majesty. His righteousness endures forever. 
He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered. Adonai is gracious and merciful. 
He has given food to those who fear him. He always remembers his covenant ·binding contract between two or more parties·. 
He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations. 
The works of his hands are truth and mishpat ·justice·. All his precepts are sure. 
They are established forever and ever. They are done in truth and uprightness. 
He has sent redemption to his people. He has enjoined his covenant forever. His name is holy and awesome! 
The fear of Adonai is the beginning of wisdom. All those who do his work have a good understanding. His tehilah ·praise song· endures forever!
