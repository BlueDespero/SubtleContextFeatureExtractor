Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 108.
My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· and I will give kavod ·weighty glory·. 
Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn. 
I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, Adonai , among the nations. I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you among the peoples. 
For your cheshed ·loving-kindness· is great above the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. 
Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your kavod ·weighty glory· be over all the earth. 
That your yadid ·beloved· may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us. 
God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Sukkot. 
Gilead is mine. Manasseh Causing to forget is mine. Ephraim Fruit also is my helmet. Judah Praised is my scepter. 
Moab From father is my wash pot. I will toss my sandal on Edom Red. I will shout over Philistia.” 
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom Red? 
Haven’t you rejected us, God? You don’t go out, God, with our armies. 
Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain. 
Through God, we will do valiantly. For it is he who will tread down our enemies.
