John [Yah is gracious].
Chapter 18.
When Yeshua Salvation had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered. 
Now Judas Praised, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Yeshua Salvation often met there with his disciples. 
Judas Praised then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees Separated, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 
Yeshua Salvation therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went out, and said to them, “Who are you looking for?” 
They answered him, “Yeshua Salvation of Nazareth Branch, Separated one.” Yeshua Salvation said to them, “I am he.” Judas Praised also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 
When therefore he said to them, “Ena Na I AM (the Living God),” they went backward, and fell to the ground. 
Again therefore he asked them, “Who are you looking for?” They said, “Yeshua Salvation of Nazareth Branch, Separated one.” 
Yeshua Salvation answered, “I told you that Ena Na I AM (the Living God). If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,” 
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, “Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none.” 
Simeon Peter Hearing Rock therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 
Yeshua Salvation therefore said to Peter Rock, “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which haAbba ·the Father· has given me, shall I not surely drink it?” 
So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews Praisers, seized Yeshua Salvation and bound him, 
and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas Rock that hollows itself out, who was high priest that year. 
Now it was Caiaphas Rock that hollows itself out who advised the Jews Praisers that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people. 
Simeon Peter Hearing Rock followed Yeshua Salvation, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Yeshua Salvation into the court of the high priest; 
but Peter Rock was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter Rock. 
Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter Rock, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?” He said, “I am not.” 
Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter Rock was with them, standing and warming himself. 
The high priest therefore asked Yeshua Salvation about his disciples, and about his teaching. 
Yeshua Salvation answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews Praisers always meet. I said nothing in secret. 
Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said.” 
When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Yeshua Salvation with his hand, saying, “Do you answer the high priest like that?” 
Yeshua Salvation answered him, “If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?” 
Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas Rock that hollows itself out, the high priest. 
Now Simeon Peter Hearing Rock was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it, and said, “I am not.” 
One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter Rock had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?” 
Peter Rock therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed. 
They led Yeshua Salvation therefore from Caiaphas Rock that hollows itself out into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Pesac ·Passover· meal (Nissan 14). 
Pilate Armed with javelin therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?” 
They answered him, “If this man was not an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.” 
Pilate Armed with javelin therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” Therefore the Jews Praisers said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,” 
that the word of Yeshua Salvation might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die. 
Pilate Armed with javelin therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Yeshua Salvation, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews Praisers?” 
Yeshua Salvation answered him, “Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?” 
Pilate Armed with javelin answered, “I’m not a Jew Praiser, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?” 
Yeshua Salvation answered, “My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I would not be delivered to the Jews Praisers. But now my Kingdom is not from here.” 
Pilate Armed with javelin therefore said to him, “Are you a king then?” Yeshua Salvation answered, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.” 
Pilate Armed with javelin said to him, “What is truth?” When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews Praisers, and said to them, “I find no basis for a charge against him. 
But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews Praisers?” 
Then they all shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Bar-Abba Son Father!” Now Bar-Abba Son Father was a robber.
