Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 75.
We yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, God. We yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise·, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works. 
When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly. 
The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!” I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn. 
Don’t lift up your horn on high. Don’t speak with a stiff neck.” 
For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation. 
But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another. 
For in Adonai ’s hand there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs. 
But I will declare this forever: I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to the God of Jacob Supplanter. 
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the upright shall be lifted up.
