Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 76.
In Judah Praised, God is known. His name is great in Israel God prevails. 
His tabernacle is also in Salem Complete peace, Perfect peace; His dwelling place in Zion Mountain ridge, Marking. 
There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game. 
Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the men of war can lift their hands. 
At your rebuke, God of Jacob Supplanter, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep. 
You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry? 
You pronounced judgment to be sh'ma ·heard obeyed· from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent, 
when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Surely the wrath of man yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained. 
Make vows to Adonai your God, and fulfill them! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared. 
He will cut off the spirit of princes. He is feared by the kings of the earth.
