Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 30.
I will extol you, Adonai , for you have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me. 
Adonai my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me. 
Adonai , you have brought up my soul from Sheol ·Place of the dead·. You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit (of Abbadon, the unrighteous side of Sheol). 
Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai , you saints of his. Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to his holy name. 
For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning. 
As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.” 
You, Adonai , when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled. 
I cried to you, Adonai . I made supplication to the Lord: 
“What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you? Shall it declare your truth? 
Sh'ma ·Hear obey·, Adonai , and have mercy on me. Adonai , be my helper.” 
You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness, 
To the end that my kavod ·weighty glory· may sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you, and not be silent. Adonai my God, I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you forever!
