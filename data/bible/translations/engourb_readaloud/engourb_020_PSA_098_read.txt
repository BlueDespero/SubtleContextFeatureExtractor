Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 98.
Sing to Adonai a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand, and his holy arm, have worked salvation for him. 
Adonai has made known his yishu'ah ·salvation·. He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 
He has remembered his cheshed ·loving-kindness· and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel God prevails. All the ends of the earth have seen the yishu'ah ·salvation· of our God. 
Make a joyful noise to Adonai , all the earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing zahmar ·musical praise·! 
Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to Adonai with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody. 
With trumpets and sound of the shofar ·ram horn·, make a joyful noise before the King, Adonai . 
Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein. 
Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the mountains sing for joy together. 
Let them sing before Adonai , for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
