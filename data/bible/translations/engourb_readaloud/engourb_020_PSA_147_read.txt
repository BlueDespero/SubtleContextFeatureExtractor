Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 147.
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·, for it is good to sing tehilahot ·praise songs· to our God; for it is pleasant and fitting to make zahmar ·musical praise· unto him. 
Adonai builds up Jerusalem City of peace. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel God prevails. 
He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. 
He counts the number of the stars. He calls them all by their names. 
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power. His understanding is infinite. 
Adonai upholds the humble. He brings the wicked down to the ground. 
Sing to Adonai with thanksgiving. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· on the harp to our God, 
who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass grow on the mountains. 
He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens when they call. 
He does not delight in the strength of the horse. He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man. 
Adonai takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his cheshed ·loving-kindness·. 
Praise Adonai , Jerusalem City of peace! Praise your God, Zion Mountain ridge, Marking! 
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed your children within you. 
He makes peace in your borders. He fills you with the finest of the wheat. 
He sends his word out over the earth. His word runs very swiftly. 
He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes. 
He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can stand before his cold? 
He sends out his word, and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 
He shows his word to Jacob Supplanter; his statutes and his judgments to Israel God prevails. 
He has not done this for just any nation. They don’t know his judgments. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
