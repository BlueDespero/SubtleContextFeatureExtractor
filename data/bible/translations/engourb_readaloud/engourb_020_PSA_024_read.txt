Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 24.
The earth is Adonai ’s, with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein. 
For he has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods. 
Who may ascend to Adonai ’s hill? Who may stand in his holy place? 
He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully. 
He shall receive a blessing from Adonai , righteousness from the God of his yesha' ·salvation·. 
This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face— even Jacob Supplanter. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Lift up your heads, you gates! Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the Melek haKavod King of Weighty glory will come in. 
Who is the Melek haKavod King of Weighty glory? Adonai strong and mighty, Adonai mighty in battle. 
Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the Melek haKavod King of Weighty glory will come in. 
Who is this Melek haKavod King of Glory? Adonai Tzva'ot Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies is the Melek haKavod King of Glory! Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·.
