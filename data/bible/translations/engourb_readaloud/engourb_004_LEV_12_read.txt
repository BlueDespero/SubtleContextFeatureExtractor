Leviticus / Vayikra.
Chapter 12.
Adonai spoke to Moses Drawn out, saying, 
“Speak to the children of Israel God prevails, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean. 
On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 
She shall continue in purification of blood for thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. 
But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in purification of blood for sixty-six days. 
“‘When the days of her purification are completed, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering: 
and he shall offer it before Adonai , and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. “‘This is the Torah ·Teaching· for her who bears, whether a male or a female. 
If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”
