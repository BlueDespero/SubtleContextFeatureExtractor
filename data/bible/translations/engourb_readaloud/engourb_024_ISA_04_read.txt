Isaiah / Yesha'yahu.
Chapter 4.
Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach.” 
In that day, Adonai ’s branch will be beautiful and kavod ·weighty glorious·, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and excellent for the survivors of Israel God prevails. 
It will happen, that he who is left in Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, and he who remains in Jerusalem City of peace, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem City of peace; 
when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem City of peace from within it, by the spirit of mishpat ·justice·, and by the spirit of burning. 
Adonai will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the kavod ·weighty glory· will be a canopy. 
There will be a sukkah ·temporary tent· for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
