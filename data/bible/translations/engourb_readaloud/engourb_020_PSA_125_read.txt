Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 125.
Those who trust in Adonai are as Mount Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, which can’t be moved, but remains forever. 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem City of peace, so Adonai surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more. 
For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the upright; so that the upright won’t use their hands to do evil. 
Do good, Adonai , to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts. 
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Adonai will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel God prevails.
