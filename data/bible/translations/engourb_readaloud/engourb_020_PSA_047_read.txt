Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 47.
Oh clap your hands, all you nations. Shout to God with the voice of triumph! 
For Adonai Most High is awesome. He is a great King over all the earth. 
He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet. 
He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob Supplanter whom he 'ahav ·affectionately loved·. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
God has gone up with a shout, Adonai with the sound of a shofar ·ram horn·. 
Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to God, sing zahmar ·musical praise·. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· to our King, sing zahmar ·musical praise·. 
For God is the King of all the earth. Sing zahmar ·musical praise· with understanding. 
God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne. 
The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham Father of a multitude. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted!
