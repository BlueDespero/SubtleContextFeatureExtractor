Psalms.
Chapter 32.
AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. O the blessedness of him whose transgression is forgiven, || Whose sin is covered. 
O the blessedness of a man, || To whom YHWH does not impute iniquity, || And in whose spirit there is no deceit. 
When I have kept silence, my bones have become old, || Through my roaring all the day. 
When by day and by night Your hand is heavy on me, || My moisture has been changed || Into the droughts of summer. Selah. 
I cause You to know my sin, || And I have not covered my iniquity. I have said, “I confess to YHWH concerning My transgressions,” || And You have taken away the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
For every saintly one prays this to You, || In the time to find You. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, || They do not come to him. 
You are a hiding place for me, || You keep me from distress, || Surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah. 
I cause you to act wisely, || And direct you in the way that you go, || I cause My eye to take counsel concerning you. 
Do not be as a horse—as a mule, || Without understanding, || With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, || Not to come near to you. 
Many are the pains of the wicked; As for him who is trusting in YHWH, || Kindness surrounds him. 
Be glad in YHWH, and rejoice, you righteous, || And sing, all you upright of heart!
