Job.
Chapter 22.
And Eliphaz the Temanite answers and says: 
“Is a man profitable to God, || Because a wise man is profitable to himself? 
Is it a delight to the Mighty One || That you are righteous? Is it gain, || That you make your ways perfect? 
Because of your reverence || Does He reason with you? He enters with you into judgment: 
Is your wickedness not abundant? And there is no end to your iniquities. 
For you take a pledge of your brother for nothing, || And you strip off the garments of the naked. 
You do not cause the weary to drink water, || And you withhold bread from the hungry. 
As for the man of arm—he has the earth, || And the accepted of face—he dwells in it. 
You have sent widows away empty, || And the arms of the fatherless are bruised. 
Therefore snares are all around you, || And sudden fear troubles you. 
Or darkness—you do not see, || And abundance of waters covers you. 
Is God not high in the heavens? And see the summit of the stars, || That they are high. 
And you have said, How has God known? Does He judge through thickness? 
Thick clouds are a secret place to Him, || And He does not see, || And He habitually walks above the circle of the heavens. 
Do you observe the path of the age, || That men of iniquity have trodden, 
Who have been cut down unexpectedly? A flood is poured out on their foundation. 
Those saying to God, Turn aside from us, || And what does the Mighty One do to them? 
And He has filled their houses with good (And the counsel of the wicked || Has been far from me). 
The righteous see and they rejoice, || And the innocent mocks at them: 
Surely our substance has not been cut off, || And fire has consumed their excellence. 
Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace, || Thereby your increase is good. 
Please receive a law from His mouth, || And set His sayings in your heart. 
If you return to the Mighty you are built up, || You put iniquity far from your tents. 
So as to set a defense on the dust, || And a covering on a rock of the valleys. 
And the Mighty has been your defense, || And silver is strength to you. 
For then you delight yourself on the Mighty, || And lift up your face to God, 
You make supplication to Him, || And He hears you, || And you complete your vows. 
And you decree a saying, || And it is established to you, || And light has shone on your ways. 
For they have made low, || And you say, Lift up. And He saves the bowed down of eyes. 
He delivers the one who is not innocent, || Indeed, he has been delivered || By the cleanness of your hands.”
