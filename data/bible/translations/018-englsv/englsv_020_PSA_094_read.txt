Psalms.
Chapter 94.
God of vengeance—YHWH! God of vengeance, shine forth. 
Be lifted up, judging the earth, || Send back a repayment on the proud. 
Until when do the wicked, O YHWH—Until when do the wicked exult? 
They utter—they speak arrogance, || All working iniquity boast about themselves. 
Your people, O YHWH, they bruise, || And they afflict Your inheritance. 
They slay widow and sojourner, || And they murder fatherless ones. 
And they say, “YAH does not see, || And the God of Jacob does not consider.” 
Consider, you brutish among the people, || And you foolish, when do you act wisely? 
He who plants the ear, does He not hear? He who forms the eye, does He not see? 
He who is instructing nations, does He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge is YHWH. 
He knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 
O the blessedness of the man || Whom You instruct, O YAH, || And teach him out of Your law, 
To give rest to him from days of evil, || While a pit is dug for the wicked. 
For YHWH does not leave His people, || And does not forsake His inheritance. 
For judgment turns back to righteousness, || And after it all the upright of heart. 
Who rises up for me with evildoers? Who stations himself for me with workers of iniquity? 
Unless YHWH were a help to me, || My soul had almost inhabited silence. 
If I have said, “My foot has slipped,” || Your kindness, O YHWH, supports me. 
In the abundance of my thoughts within me, || Your comforts delight my soul. 
Is a throne of mischief joined with You? A framer of perverseness by statute? 
They decree against the soul of the righteous, || And declare innocent blood wicked. 
And YHWH is for a high place to me, || And my God is for a rock—my refuge, 
And He turns back their iniquity on them, || And in their wickedness cuts them off; Our God YHWH cuts them off!
