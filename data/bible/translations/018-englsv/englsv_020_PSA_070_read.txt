Psalms.
Chapter 70.
TO THE OVERSEER. BY DAVID. “TO CAUSE TO REMEMBER.” O God, hurry to deliver me, || O YHWH, hurry to help me. 
Let them be ashamed and confounded || Who are seeking my soul, || Let them be turned backward and blush || Who are desiring my evil. 
Let them turn back because of their shame, || Who are saying, “Aha, aha.” 
Let all those seeking You rejoice and be glad in You, || And let those loving Your salvation || Continually say, “God is magnified.” 
And I am poor and needy, O God, hurry to me, || You are my help and my deliverer, || O YHWH, do not linger!
