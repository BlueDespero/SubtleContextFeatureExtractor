Isaiah.
Chapter 35.
They rejoice from the wilderness and dry place, || And the desert rejoices, || And flourishes as the rose, 
Flourishing it flourishes, and rejoices, || Indeed, with joy and singing, || The glory of Lebanon has been given to it, || The beauty of Carmel and Sharon, || They see the glory of YHWH, || The majesty of our God. 
Strengthen the feeble hands, || Indeed, strengthen the stumbling knees. 
Say to the hurried of heart, “Be strong, || Do not fear, behold, your God; vengeance comes, || The repayment of God, || He Himself comes and saves you.” 
Then eyes of the blind are opened, || And ears of the deaf are unstopped, 
Then the lame leap as a deer, || And the tongue of the mute sings, || For waters have been broken up in a wilderness, || And streams in a desert. 
And the mirage has become a pond, || And the thirsty land—fountains of waters, || In the habitation of dragons, || Its place of lying down, || A court for reed and rush. 
And a highway has been there, and a way, || And it is called the “Way of Holiness.” The unclean do not pass over it, || And He Himself is by them, || Whoever is going in the way—even fools do not err. 
No lion is there, || Indeed, a destructive beast does not ascend it, || It is not found there, || And the redeemed have walked, 
And the ransomed of YHWH return, || And have entered Zion with singing, || And with continuous joy on their head, || They attain joy and gladness, || And sorrow and sighing have fled away!
