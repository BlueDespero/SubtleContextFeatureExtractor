Hosea.
Chapter 6.
“Come, and we turn back to YHWH, || For He has torn, and He heals us, || He strikes, and He binds us up. 
He revives us after two days, || In the third day He raises us up, || And we live before Him. 
And we know—we pursue to know YHWH, || His going forth is prepared as the dawn, || And He comes in as a shower to us, || As spring rain and autumn rain to the earth.” 
“What do I do to you, O Ephraim? What do I do to you, O Judah? Your goodness is as a cloud of the morning, || And as dew rising early—going. 
Therefore I have hewed by prophets, || I have slain them by sayings of My mouth, || And My judgments go forth to the light. 
For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, || And a knowledge of God above burnt-offerings. 
And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, || There they dealt treacherously against Me. 
Gilead is a city of workers of iniquity, || Slippery from blood. 
And as bands wait for a man, || A company of priests murder—the way to Shechem, || For they have done wickedness. 
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, || There is the whoredom of Ephraim—Israel is defiled. 
Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed to you, || In My turning back to the captivity of My people!”
