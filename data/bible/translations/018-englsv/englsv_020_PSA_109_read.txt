Psalms.
Chapter 109.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. O God of my praise, do not be silent, 
For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, || They have opened against me, || They have spoken with me—A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred! 
They have surrounded me about, || And they fight me without cause. 
For my love they oppose me, and I—prayer! 
And they set against me evil for good, || And hatred for my love. 
Appoint the wicked over him, || And an adversary stands at his right hand. 
In his being judged, he goes forth wicked, || And his prayer is for sin. 
His days are few, another takes his oversight, 
His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow. 
And his sons wander continually, || Indeed, they have begged, || And have sought out of their dry places. 
An exactor lays a snare for all that he has, || And strangers spoil his labor. 
He has none to extend kindness, || Nor is there one showing favor to his orphans. 
His posterity is for cutting off, || Their name is blotted out in another generation. 
The iniquity of his fathers || Is remembered to YHWH, || And the sin of his mother is not blotted out. 
They are continually before YHWH, || And He cuts off their memorial from earth. 
Because that he has not remembered to do kindness, || And pursues the poor man and needy, || And the struck of heart—to slay, 
And he loves reviling, and it meets him, || And he has not delighted in blessing, || And it is far from him. 
And he puts on reviling as his robe, || And it comes in as water into his midst, || And as oil into his bones. 
It is to him as apparel—he covers himself, || And he girds it on for a continual girdle. 
This is the wage of my accusers from YHWH, || And of those speaking evil against my soul. 
And You, O Lord YHWH, || Deal with me for Your Name’s sake, || Because Your kindness is good, deliver me. 
For I am poor and needy, || And my heart has been pierced in my midst. 
I have gone as a shadow when it is stretched out, || I have been driven away as a locust. 
My knees have been feeble from fasting, || And my flesh has failed of fatness. 
And I have been a reproach to them, || They see me, they shake their head. 
Help me, O YHWH my God, || Save me, according to Your kindness. 
And they know that this is Your hand, || You, O YHWH, You have done it. 
They revile, and You bless, || They have risen, and are ashamed, || And Your servant rejoices. 
My accusers put on blushing, and are covered, || Their shame is as an upper robe. 
I thank YHWH greatly with my mouth, || And I praise Him in the midst of many, 
For He stands at the right hand of the needy, || To save from those judging his soul.
