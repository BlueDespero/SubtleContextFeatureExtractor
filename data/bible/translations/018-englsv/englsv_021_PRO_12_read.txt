Proverbs.
Chapter 12.
Whoever is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, || And whoever is hating reproof is brutish. 
The good brings forth favor from YHWH, || And the man of wicked schemes He condemns. 
A man is not established by wickedness, || And the root of the righteous is not moved. 
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, || And as rottenness in his bones is one causing shame. 
The thoughts of the righteous are justice, || The counsels of the wicked—deceit. 
The words of the wicked are: “Lay in wait for blood,” || And the mouth of the upright delivers them. 
Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, || And the house of the righteous stands. 
A man is praised according to his wisdom, || And the perverted of heart becomes despised. 
Better is the lightly esteemed who has a servant, || Than the self-honored who lacks bread. 
The righteous knows the life of his beast, || And the mercies of the wicked are cruel. 
Whoever is tilling the ground is satisfied with bread, || And whoever is pursuing vanities is lacking heart, 
The wicked has desired the net of evildoers, || And the root of the righteous gives. 
The snare of the wicked is in transgression of the lips, || And the righteous goes out from distress. 
One is satisfied with good from the fruit of the mouth, || And the deed of man’s hands returns to him. 
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, || And whoever is listening to counsel is wise. 
The fool—his anger is known in a day, || And the prudent is covering shame. 
Whoever utters faithfulness declares righteousness, || And a false witness—deceit. 
A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, || And the tongue of the wise is healing. 
The lip of truth is established forever, || And a tongue of falsehood for a moment. 
Deceit is in the heart of those devising evil, || But for counselors of peace—joy. 
No iniquity is desired by the righteous, || And the wicked have been full of evil. 
Lying lips are an abomination to YHWH, || And steadfast doers are his delight. 
A prudent man is concealing knowledge, || And the heart of fools proclaims folly. 
The hand of the diligent rules, || And slothfulness becomes tributary. 
Sorrow in the heart of a man bows down, || And a good word makes him glad. 
The righteous searches his companion, || And the way of the wicked causes them to err. 
The slothful does not roast his game, || And the wealth of a diligent man is precious. 
In the path of righteousness is life, || And in the way of that path is no death!
