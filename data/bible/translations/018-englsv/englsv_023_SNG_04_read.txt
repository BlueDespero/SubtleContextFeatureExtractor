Song of Songs.
Chapter 4.
Behold, you are beautiful, my friend, behold, you are beautiful, || Your eyes are doves behind your veil, || Your hair as a row of the goats that have shone from Mount Gilead, 
Your teeth as a row of the shorn ones that have come up from the washing, || For all of them are forming twins, || And a bereaved one is not among them. 
As a thread of scarlet are your lips, || And your speech is lovely, || As the work of the pomegranate is your temple behind your veil, 
As the Tower of David is your neck, built for an armory, || The chief of the shields are hung on it, || All shields of the mighty. 
Your two breasts are as two fawns, || Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies. 
Until the day breaks forth, || And the shadows have fled away, || I go for myself to the mountain of myrrh, || And to the hill of frankincense. 
You are all beautiful, my friend, || And there is not a blemish in you. Come from Lebanon, O spouse, 
Come from Lebanon, come in. Look from the top of Amana, || From the top of Shenir and Hermon, || From the habitations of lions, || From the mountains of leopards. 
You have emboldened me, my sister-spouse, || Emboldened me with one of your eyes, || With one chain of your neck. 
How beautiful have been your loves, my sister-spouse, || How much better have been your loves than wine, || And the fragrance of your perfumes than all spices. 
Your lips drop honey, O spouse, || Honey and milk are under your tongue, || And the fragrance of your garments || Is as the fragrance of Lebanon. 
A garden shut up is my sister-spouse, || A spring shut up—a fountain sealed. 
Your shoots a paradise of pomegranates, || With precious fruits, 
Cypresses with nard—nard and saffron, || Cane and cinnamon, || With all trees of frankincense, || Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices. 
A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, || And flowings from Lebanon! 
Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, || Cause my garden to breathe forth, its spices let flow, || Let my beloved come to his garden, || And eat its pleasant fruits!
