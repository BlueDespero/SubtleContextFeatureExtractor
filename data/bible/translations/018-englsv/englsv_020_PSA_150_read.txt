Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Praise YAH! Praise God in His holy place, || Praise Him in the expanse of His strength. 
Praise Him in His mighty acts, || Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness. 
Praise Him with blowing of horn, || Praise Him with stringed instrument and harp. 
Praise Him with timbrel and dance, || Praise Him with stringed instruments and pipe. 
Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, || Praise Him with cymbals of shouting. 
All that breathes praise YAH! Praise YAH!
