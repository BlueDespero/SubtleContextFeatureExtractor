Numbers.
Chapter 12.
And Miriam speaks—Aaron also—against Moses concerning the circumstance of the Cushite woman whom he had taken, for he had taken a Cushite woman; 
and they say, “Has YHWH only spoken by Moses? Has he not also spoken by us?” And YHWH hears. 
And the man Moses is very humble, more than any of the men who are on the face of the ground. 
And YHWH suddenly says to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting”; and those three come out. 
And YHWH comes down in the pillar of the cloud, and stands at the opening of the tent, and calls Aaron and Miriam, and both of them come out. 
And He says, “Now hear My words: If your prophet is of YHWH, || I make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream. 
Not so My servant Moses; He is steadfast in all My house. 
I speak with him mouth to mouth, || Even by an appearance, and not in riddles; And he beholds the form of YHWH attentively. Now why have you not been afraid || To speak against My servant—against Moses?” 
And the anger of YHWH burns against them, and He goes on, 
and the cloud has turned aside from off the tent, and behold, Miriam is leprous as snow; and Aaron turns to Miriam, and behold, leprous! 
And Aaron says to Moses, “O my lord, please do not lay this sin on us in which we have been foolish, and in which we have sinned; 
please do not let her be as one dead, when in his coming out from the womb of his mother—the half of his flesh is consumed.” 
And Moses cries to YHWH, saying, “O God, please give healing to her! Please!” 
And YHWH says to Moses, “But if her father had but spat in her face—is she not ashamed for seven days? She is shut out for seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterward she is gathered.” 
And Miriam is shut out at the outside of the camp for seven days, and the people have not journeyed until Miriam is gathered; 
and afterward the people have journeyed from Hazeroth, and they encamp in the wilderness of Paran.
