Psalms.
Chapter 145.
A PRAISE SONG OF DAVID. ALEPH-BET I exalt You, my God, O king, || And bless Your Name for all time and forever. 
Every day I bless You, || And praise Your Name for all time and forever. 
YHWH is great, and greatly praised, || And there is no searching of His greatness. 
Generation to generation praises Your works, || And they declare Your mighty acts. 
The majesty, the glory of Your splendor, || And the matters of Your wonders, I declare. 
And they tell of the strength of Your fearful acts, || And I recount Your greatness. 
They send forth the memorial of the abundance of Your goodness. And they sing of Your righteousness. 
YHWH is gracious and merciful, || Slow to anger, and great in kindness. 
YHWH is good to all, || And His mercies are over all His works. 
O YHWH, all Your works confess You, || And Your saints bless You. 
They tell of the glory of Your kingdom, || And they speak of Your might, 
To make His mighty acts known to sons of men, || The glory of the majesty of His kingdom. 
Your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, || And Your dominion is in all generations. YHWH is faithful in all His words, || And kind in all His works. 
YHWH is supporting all who are falling, || And raising up all who are bowed down. 
The eyes of all look to You, || And You are giving their food to them in its season, 
Opening Your hand, and satisfying || The desire of every living thing. 
YHWH is righteous in all His ways, || And kind in all His works. 
YHWH is near to all those calling Him, || To all who call Him in truth. 
He does the desire of those fearing Him, || And He hears their cry, and saves them. 
YHWH preserves all those loving Him, || And He destroys all the wicked. 
My mouth speaks the praise of YHWH, || And all flesh blesses His Holy Name, || For all time and forever!
