Psalms.
Chapter 30.
A PSALM. A SONG OF THE DEDICATION OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID. I exalt You, O YHWH, || For You have drawn me up, || And have not let my enemies rejoice over me. 
My God YHWH, I have cried to You, || And You heal me. 
YHWH, You have brought up my soul from Sheol, || You have kept me alive, || From going down to the pit. 
Sing praise to YHWH, you His saints, || And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness, 
For—a moment is in His anger, || Life is in His goodwill, || At evening remains weeping, and at morning singing. 
And I have said in my ease, “I am not moved for all time. 
O YHWH, in Your good pleasure, || You have caused strength to remain for my mountain,” || You have hidden Your face—I have been troubled. 
To You, O YHWH, I call, || And to YHWH I make supplication. 
“What gain is in my blood? In my going down to corruption? Does dust thank You? Does it declare Your truth? 
Hear, O YHWH, and favor me, O YHWH, be a helper to me.” 
You have turned my mourning to dancing for me, || You have loosed my sackcloth, || And gird me with joy. 
So that glory praises You, and is not silent, || O YHWH, my God, I thank You for all time!
