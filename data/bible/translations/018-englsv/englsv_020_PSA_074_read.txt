Psalms.
Chapter 74.
AN INSTRUCTION OF ASAPH. Why, O God, have You cast off forever? Your anger smokes against the flock of Your pasture. 
Remember Your congregation || That You purchased of old, || You redeemed the rod of Your inheritance, || This Mount Zion—You dwelt in it. 
Lift up Your steps to the continuous desolations, || Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary. 
Your adversaries have roared, || In the midst of Your meeting-places, || They have set their ensigns as ensigns. 
He is known as one bringing in on high || Against a thicket of wood—axes. 
And now they break down its engravings, || Together, with axe and hatchet, 
They have sent Your sanctuary into fire, || They defiled the Dwelling Place of Your Name to the earth, 
They said in their hearts, “Let us oppress them together,” || They burned all the meeting-places of God in the land. 
We have not seen our ensigns, || There is no longer a prophet, || Nor with us is one knowing how long. 
Until when, O God, does an adversary reproach? Does an enemy despise Your Name forever? 
Why do You turn back Your hand, || Even Your right hand? Remove it from the midst of Your bosom. 
And God is my king of old, || Working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
You have divided the sea by Your strength, || You have shattered heads of dragons by the waters, 
You have broken the heads of leviathan, || You make him food for the people of desert-dwellers. 
You have cleaved a fountain and a stream, || You have dried up perennial flowings. 
The day is Yours, || The night is also Yours, || You have prepared a light-giver—the sun. 
You have set up all the borders of earth, || Summer and winter—You have formed them. 
Remember this—an enemy reproached YHWH, || And a foolish people have despised Your Name. 
Do not give up to a wild creature, || The soul of Your turtle-dove, || Do not forget the life of Your poor ones forever. 
Look attentively to the covenant, || For the dark places of earth, || Have been full of habitations of violence. 
Do not let the oppressed turn back ashamed, || Let the poor and needy praise Your Name, 
Arise, O God, plead Your plea, || Remember Your reproach from a fool all the day. 
Do not forget the voice of Your adversaries, || The noise of Your withstanders is going up continually!
