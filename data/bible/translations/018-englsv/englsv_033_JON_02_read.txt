Jonah.
Chapter 2.
And Jonah prays to his God YHWH from the bowels of the fish. 
And he says: “I called, because of my distress, to YHWH, || And He answers me, || From the belly of Sheol I have cried, || You have heard my voice. 
When You cast me into the deep, || Into the heart of the seas, || Then the flood surrounds me, || All Your breakers and Your billows have passed over me. 
And I said: I have been cast out from before Your eyes || (Yet I add to look to Your holy temple!) 
Waters have surrounded me to the soul, || The deep surrounds me, || The weed is bound to my head. 
To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, || The earth, her bars are behind me for all time. And You bring my life up from the pit, O YHWH my God. 
In the feebleness of my soul within me, || I have remembered YHWH, || And my prayer comes to You, || Into Your holy temple. 
Those observing lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
And I—with a voice of thanksgiving—I sacrifice to You, || That which I have vowed I complete, || Salvation is of YHWH.” 
And YHWH speaks to the fish, and it vomits Jonah out on the dry land.
