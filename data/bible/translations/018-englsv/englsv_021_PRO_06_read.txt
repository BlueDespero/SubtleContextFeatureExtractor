Proverbs.
Chapter 6.
My son! If you have been guarantor for your friend, || Have struck your hand for a stranger, 
Have been snared with sayings of your mouth, || Have been captured with sayings of your mouth, 
Do this now, my son, and be delivered, || For you have come into the hand of your friend. Go, trample on yourself, and strengthen your friend, 
Do not give sleep to your eyes, || And slumber to your eyelids, 
Be delivered as a roe from the hand, || And as a bird from the hand of a fowler. 
Go to the ant, O slothful one, || See her ways and be wise; 
Which has no captain, overseer, and ruler, 
She prepares her bread in summer, || She has gathered her food in harvest. 
Until when, O slothful one, do you lie? When do you arise from your sleep? 
A little sleep, a little slumber, || A little clasping of the hands to rest, 
And your poverty has come as a traveler, || And your want as an armed man. 
A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, || Walking with perverseness of mouth, 
Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, || Directing with his fingers, 
Contrariness is in his heart, devising evil at all times, || He sends forth contentions. 
Therefore his calamity comes suddenly, || He is broken instantly—and no healing. 
These six has YHWH hated, || Indeed, seven are abominations to His soul: 
High eyes, || False tongues, || And hands shedding innocent blood, 
A heart devising thoughts of vanity, || Feet hastening to run to evil, 
A false witness who breathes out lies, || And one sending forth contentions between brothers. 
Keep, my son, the command of your father, || And do not leave the law of your mother. 
Bind them on your heart continually, || Tie them on your neck. 
In your going up and down, it leads you, || In your lying down, it watches over you, || And you have awoken—it talks with you. 
For the command is a lamp, || And the Law a light, || And a way of life are reproofs of instruction, 
To preserve you from an evil woman, || From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 
Do not desire her beauty in your heart, || And do not let her take you with her eyelids. 
For a harlot consumes to a cake of bread, || And an adulteress hunts the precious soul. 
Does a man take fire into his bosom, || And are his garments not burned? 
Does a man walk on the hot coals, || And are his feet not scorched? 
So is he who has gone in to the wife of his neighbor, || None who touches her is innocent. 
They do not despise the thief, || When he steals to fill his soul when he is hungry, 
And being found he repays sevenfold, || He gives all the substance of his house. 
He who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart, || He who does it is destroying his soul. 
He finds a stroke and shame, || And his reproach is not wiped away, 
For jealousy is the fury of a man, || And he does not spare in a day of vengeance. 
He does not accept the appearance of any atonement, || Indeed, he does not consent, || Though you multiply bribes!
