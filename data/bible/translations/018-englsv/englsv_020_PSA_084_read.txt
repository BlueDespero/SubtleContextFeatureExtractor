Psalms.
Chapter 84.
TO THE OVERSEER. ON THE GITTITH. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. How beloved Your dwelling places, YHWH of Hosts! 
My soul desired, indeed, it has also been consumed, || For the courts of YHWH, || My heart and my flesh cry aloud to the living God, 
Even a sparrow has found a house, || And a swallow a nest for herself, || Where she has placed her brood—Your altars, O YHWH of Hosts, || My king and my God. 
O the blessedness of those inhabiting Your house, || Yet they praise You. Selah. 
O the blessedness of a man whose strength is in You, || Highways are in their heart. 
Those passing through a valley of weeping make it a spring, || The early rain covers it with pools. 
They go from strength to strength, || He appears to God in Zion. 
O YHWH, God of Hosts, hear my prayer, || Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
Our shield, see, O God, || And behold the face of Your anointed, 
For a day in Your courts is good, O Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, || In the house of my God, || Than to dwell in tents of wickedness. 
For YHWH God is a sun and a shield, || YHWH gives grace and glory. He does not withhold good || To those walking in uprightness. 
YHWH of Hosts! O the blessedness of a man trusting in You.
