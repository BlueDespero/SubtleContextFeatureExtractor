TO THE OVERSEER. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF ASAPH. My voice is to God, and I cry, || My voice is to God, || And He has given ear to me. 
I sought the Lord in a day of my distress, || My hand has been spread out by night, || And it does not cease, || My soul has refused to be comforted. 
I remember God, and make a noise, || I meditate, and my spirit is feeble. Selah. 
You have taken hold of the watches of my eyes, || I have been moved, and I do not speak. 
I have reckoned the days of old, || The years of the ages. 
I remember my music in the night, || I meditate with my heart, and my spirit searches diligently: 
Does the Lord cast off for all ages? Does He add to be pleased no longer? 
Has His kindness ceased forever? The saying failed from generation to generation? 
Has God forgotten His favors? Has He shut up His mercies in anger? Selah. 
And I say: “My weakness is, || The changes of the right hand of the Most High.” 
I mention the doings of YAH, || For I remember Your wonders of old, 
And I have meditated on all Your working, || And I talk concerning Your doings. 
O God, Your way is in holiness, || Who is a great god like God? 
You are the God doing wonders. You have made Your strength known among the peoples, 
You have redeemed Your people with strength, || The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
The waters have seen You, O God, || The waters have seen You, || They are afraid—also depths are troubled. 
Thick clouds have poured out waters, || The skies have given forth a noise, || Also—Your arrows go up and down. 
The voice of Your thunder is in the spheres, || Lightnings have lightened the world, || The earth has trembled, indeed, it shakes. 
Your way is in the sea, || And Your paths in many waters, || And Your tracks have not been known. 
You have led Your people as a flock, || By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
