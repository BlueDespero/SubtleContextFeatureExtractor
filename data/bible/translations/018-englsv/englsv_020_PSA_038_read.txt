Psalms.
Chapter 38.
A PSALM OF DAVID. “TO CAUSE TO REMEMBER.” YHWH, do not reprove me in Your wrath, || Nor discipline me in Your fury. 
For Your arrows have come down on me, || And You let down Your hand on me. 
Soundness is not in my flesh, || Because of Your indignation, || Peace is not in my bones, || Because of my sin. 
For my iniquities have passed over my head, || As a heavy burden—too heavy for me. 
Stunk—my wounds have become corrupt, || Because of my folly. 
I have been bent down, || I have been bowed down—to excess, || I have gone mourning all the day. 
For my flanks have been full of drought, || And soundness is not in my flesh. 
I have been feeble and struck—to excess, || I have roared from disquietude of heart. 
Lord, all my desire is before You, || And my sighing has not been hid from You. 
My heart is panting, my power has forsaken me, || And the light of my eyes, || Even they are not with me. 
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from before my plague. And my neighbors have stood far off. 
And those seeking my soul lay a snare, || And those seeking my evil || Have spoken mischievous things, || And they meditate on deceits all the day. 
And I, as deaf, do not hear. And as a mute one who does not open his mouth. 
Indeed, I am as a man who does not hear, || And in his mouth are no reproofs. 
Because for You, O YHWH, I have waited, || You answer, O Lord my God. 
When I said, “Lest they rejoice over me, || In the slipping of my foot they magnified themselves against me.” 
For I am ready to halt, || And my pain is continually before me. 
For I declare my iniquity, || I am sorry for my sin. 
And my enemies are lively, || They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, || Have been multiplied. 
And those paying evil for good accuse me, || Because of my pursuing good. 
Do not forsake me, O YHWH, || My God, do not be far from me, 
Hurry to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
