Isaiah.
Chapter 32.
Behold, a king reigns for righteousness, || As for princes, they rule for judgment. 
And each has been as a hiding place from wind, || And as a secret hiding place from inundation, || As streams of waters in a dry place, || As a shadow of a heavy rock in a weary land. 
And the eyes of beholders are not dazzled, || And the ears of hearers attend. 
And the heart of those hurried understands to know, || And the tongue of stammerers hurries to speak clearly. 
A fool is no more called “noble,” || And to a miser it is not said, “rich”; 
For a fool speaks folly, || And his heart does iniquity, to do profanity, || And to speak error concerning YHWH, || To empty the soul of the hungry, || Indeed, he causes the thirsty to lack their drink. 
And the miser—his instruments are evil, || He has counseled wicked schemes, || To corrupt the poor with lying sayings, || Even when the needy speaks justly. 
And the noble counseled noble things, || And he rises up for noble things. 
Women, easy ones, rise, hear my voice, || Daughters, confident ones, give ear to my saying, 
In days and a year || You are troubled, O confident ones, || For harvest has been consumed, || The gathering does not come. 
Tremble, you women, you easy ones, || Be troubled, you confident ones, || Strip and make bare, with a girdle on the loins, 
They are lamenting for breasts, || For fields of desire, for the fruitful vine. 
Over the ground of my people thorn and brier go up, || Surely over all houses of joy of the exulting city, 
The palace has been left, || The multitude of the city forsaken, || Fort and watchtower have been for dens for all time, || A joy of wild donkeys—a pasture of herds; 
Until the Spirit is emptied out on us from on high, || And a wilderness has become a fruitful field, || And the fruitful field is reckoned for a forest. 
And judgment has dwelt in the wilderness, || And righteousness remains in the fruitful field. 
And a work of the righteousness has been peace, || And a service of the righteousness—Keeping quiet and confidence for all time. 
And My people have dwelt in a peaceful habitation, || And in steadfast dwelling places, || And in quiet resting places. 
And it has hailed in the going down of the forest, || And the city is low in the valley. 
Blessed are you sowing by all waters, || Sending forth the foot of the ox and the donkey!
