Psalms.
Chapter 60.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “LILY OF TESTIMONY.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, TO TEACH, IN HIS STRIVING WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM AND WITH ARAM-ZOBAH, WHEN JOAB TURNS BACK AND STRIKES EDOM IN THE VALLEY OF SALT—TWELVE THOUSAND. O God, You had cast us off, || You had broken us—had been angry! You turn back to us. 
You have caused the land to tremble, || You have broken it, || Heal its breaches, for it has moved. 
You have shown Your people a hard thing, || You have caused us to drink wine of trembling. 
You have given an ensign to those fearing You, || To be lifted up as an ensign || Because of truth. Selah. 
That Your beloved ones may be drawn out, || Save with Your right hand, and answer us. 
God has spoken in His holiness: I exult—I apportion Shechem, || And I measure the Valley of Succoth, 
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine, || And Ephraim is the strength of My head, || Judah is My lawgiver, 
Moab is My pot for washing, || Over Edom I cast My shoe, || Shout, concerning Me, O Philistia. 
Who brings me to a city of bulwarks? Who has led me to Edom? 
Is it not You, O God? Have You cast us off? And do You not go forth, O God, with our hosts? 
Give to us help from adversity, || And the deliverance of man is vain. 
We do mightily in God, || And He treads down our adversaries!
