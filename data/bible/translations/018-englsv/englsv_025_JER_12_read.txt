Jeremiah.
Chapter 12.
You are righteous, O YHWH, || When I plead toward You, || Only, let me speak judgments with You, || Why did the way of the wicked prosper? All treacherous dealers have been at rest. 
You have planted them, || Indeed, they have taken root, || They go on, indeed, they have made fruit, || You are near in their mouth, || And far off from their reins. 
And You, O YHWH, You have known me, || You see me, and have tried my heart with You, || Draw them away as sheep to slaughter, || And separate them for a day of slaughter. 
Until when does the earth mourn, || And the herb of the whole field wither? For the wickedness of those dwelling in it, || Beast and bird have been consumed, || Because they said, “He does not see our latter end.” 
“For you have run with footmen, || And they weary you, || And how you fret yourself with horses! Even in the land of peace, || In which you are confident—And how will you do in the rising of Jordan? 
For even your brothers and the house of your father, || Even they dealt treacherously against you, || Even they called after you fully, || Do not trust in them when they speak good things to you. 
I have forsaken My house, || I have left My inheritance, || I have given the beloved of My soul || Into the hand of her enemies. 
My inheritance has been to Me as a lion in a forest, || She gave forth against Me with her voice, || Therefore I have hated her. 
Is My inheritance a speckled bird to Me? Is the bird around against her? Come, assemble, every beast of the field, || Come for food. 
Many shepherds destroyed My vineyard, || They have trodden down My portion, || They have made My desirable portion || Become a wilderness—a desolation. 
He has made it become a desolation, || The desolation has mourned to Me, || All the land has been desolated, || But there is no one laying it to heart. 
Spoilers have come in on all high places in the plain, || For the sword of YHWH is consuming, || From the end of the land even to the end of the land, || There is no peace to any flesh. 
They sowed wheat, and have reaped thorns, || They have become sick—they do not profit, || And they have been ashamed of your increases, || Because of the fierceness of the anger of YHWH.” 
Thus said YHWH: “Concerning all My evil neighbors, who are striking against the inheritance that I caused My people—Israel—to inherit: Behold, I am plucking them from off their ground, || And I pluck the house of Judah out of their midst. 
And it has been, after My plucking them out, || I turn back, and have pitied them, || And I have brought them back, || Each to his inheritance, and each to his land. 
And it has come to pass, || If they learn the ways of My people well, || To swear by My Name, YHWH lives, || As they taught My people to swear by Ba‘al, || Then they have been built up in the midst of My people. 
And if they do not listen, || Then I have plucked up that nation, || Plucking up and destroying,” || A declaration of YHWH!
