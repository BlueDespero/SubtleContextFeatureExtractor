Proverbs.
Chapter 19.
Better is the poor walking in his integrity, || Than the perverse in his lips—who is a fool. 
Also, without knowledge the soul is not good, || And the hasty in feet is sinning. 
The folly of man perverts his way, || And his heart is angry against YHWH. 
Wealth adds many friends, || And the poor is separated from his neighbor. 
A false witness is not acquitted, || Whoever breathes out lies is not delivered. 
Many beg the face of the noble, || And all have made friendship to a man of gifts. 
All the brothers of the poor have hated him, || Surely his friends have also been far from him, || He is pursuing words—they are not! 
Whoever is getting heart is loving his soul, || He is keeping understanding to find good. 
A false witness is not acquitted, || And whoever breathes out lies perishes. 
Luxury is not fitting for a fool, || Much less for a servant to rule among princes. 
The wisdom of a man has deferred his anger, || And his glory is to pass over transgression. 
The wrath of a king is a growl as of a young lion, || And his goodwill as dew on the herb. 
A foolish son is a calamity to his father, || And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 
House and wealth are the inheritance of fathers, || And an understanding wife is from YHWH. 
Sloth causes deep sleep to fall, || And an indolent soul hungers. 
Whoever is keeping the command is keeping his soul, || Whoever is despising His ways dies. 
Whoever is lending to YHWH is favoring the poor, || And He repays his deed to him. 
Discipline your son, for there is hope, || And do not lift up your soul to put him to death. 
A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, || For if you deliver, yet again you add. 
Hear counsel and receive instruction, || So that you are wise in your latter end. 
The purposes in a man’s heart are many, || And the counsel of YHWH—it stands. 
The desirableness of a man is his kindness, || And the poor is better than a liar. 
The fear of YHWH is to life, || And he remains satisfied—he is not charged with evil. 
The slothful has hidden his hand in a dish, || Even to his mouth he does not bring it back. 
Strike a scorner, and the simple acts prudently, || And give reproof to the intelligent, || He understands knowledge. 
Whoever is spoiling a father causes a mother to flee, || A son causing shame, and bringing confusion. 
Cease, my son, to hear instruction—To err from sayings of knowledge. 
A worthless witness scorns judgment, || And the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity. 
Judgments have been prepared for scorners, || And stripes for the back of fools!
