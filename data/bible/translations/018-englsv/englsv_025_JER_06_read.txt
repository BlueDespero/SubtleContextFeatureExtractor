Jeremiah.
Chapter 6.
“Strengthen yourselves, sons of Benjamin, || From the midst of Jerusalem, || And blow a horn in Tekoa, || And lift up a flame over Beth-Haccerem, || For evil has been seen from the north, || And great destruction. 
I have cut off the lovely and delicate one, || The daughter of Zion. 
Shepherds and their droves come to her, || They have struck tents by her all around, || They have each fed in his own station.” 
“Sanctify the battle against her, || Rise, and we go up at noon. Woe to us, for the day has turned, || For the shades of evening are stretched out, 
Rise, and we go up by night, || And we destroy her palaces.” 
For thus said YHWH of Hosts: “Cut down her wood, || And pour out a mound against Jerusalem, || She is the city to be inspected, || She is full of oppression in her midst. 
As the digging of a well, is for its waters, || So she has dug for her wickedness, || Violence and spoil is heard in her, || Sickness and striking are continually before My face. 
Be instructed, O Jerusalem, || Lest My soul be alienated from you, || Lest I make you a desolation, || A land that is not inhabited.” 
Thus said YHWH of Hosts: “They surely glean, as a vine, the remnant of Israel, || Put your hand back, as a gatherer to the baskets.” 
To whom do I speak, and testify, and they hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, || And they are not able to attend. Behold, a word of YHWH has been to them for a reproach, || They do not delight in it. 
And I have been filled with the fury of YHWH || (I have been weary of containing), “To pour it on the suckling in the street, || And on the assembly of youths together, || For even husband with wife are captured, || The elderly with one full of days, 
And their houses have been turned to others, || Fields and wives together, || For I stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“For from their least to their greatest, || Everyone is gaining dishonest gain, || And from prophet even to priest, || Everyone is dealing falsely, 
And they heal the breach of the daughter of My people slightly, || Saying, Peace, peace! And there is no peace. 
They were ashamed when they did abomination! Indeed, they are not at all ashamed, || Indeed, they have not known blushing, || Therefore they fall among those falling, || In the time I have inspected them, || They stumble,” said YHWH. 
Thus said YHWH: “Stand by the ways and see, and ask for paths of old, || Where is this—the good way? And go in it, || And find rest for yourselves. And they say, We do not go. 
And I have raised up watchmen for you, || Attend to the voice of the horn. And they say, We do not attend. 
Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O congregation, || That which is on them. 
Hear, O earth, behold, I am bringing evil on this people, || The fruit of their plans, || For they gave no attention to My words, || And My law—they kick against it. 
Why is this to Me? Frankincense comes from Sheba, || And the sweet cane from a far-off land, || Your burnt-offerings are not for acceptance, || And your sacrifices have not been sweet to Me.” 
Therefore, thus said YHWH: “Behold, I give stumbling blocks to this people, || And fathers and sons have stumbled against them together, || The neighbor and his friend perish.” 
Thus said YHWH: “Behold, a people has come from a north country, || And a great nation is stirred up from the sides of the earth. 
They take hold of bow and javelin, || It is fierce, and they have no mercy, || Their voice sounds as a sea, || And they ride on horses, || Set in array as a man of war, || Against you, O daughter of Zion.” 
We have heard its sound, our hands have been feeble, || Distress has seized us, pain as of a travailing woman. 
Do not go forth to the field, || And do not walk in the way, || For the enemy has a sword, || Fear is all around. 
O daughter of my people, || Gird on sackcloth, || And roll yourself in ashes, || Make mourning as for an only one, || A most bitter lamentation, || For the spoiler suddenly comes against us. 
“I have given you a watchtower, || A fortress among My people, || And you know, and have tried their way. 
All of them are turned aside by apostates, || Walking slanderously—bronze and iron, || All of them are corrupters. 
The bellows have been burned, || The lead has been consumed by fire, || A refiner has refined in vain, || And the wicked have not been drawn away. 
They have called them rejected silver, || For YHWH has kicked against them!”
