Proverbs.
Chapter 14.
Every wise woman has built her house, || And the foolish breaks it down with her hands. 
Whoever is walking in his uprightness is fearing YHWH, || And the perverted is despising Him in his ways. 
A rod of pride is in the mouth of a fool, || And the lips of the wise preserve them. 
Without oxen a stall is clean, || And great is the increase by the power of the ox. 
A faithful witness does not lie, || And a false witness breathes out lies. 
A scorner has sought wisdom, and it is not, || And knowledge is easy to the intelligent. 
Go from before a foolish man, || Or you have not known the lips of knowledge. 
The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way, || And the folly of fools is deceit. 
Fools mock at a guilt-offering, || And among the upright—a pleasing thing. 
The heart knows its own bitterness, || And a stranger does not interfere with its joy. 
The house of the wicked is destroyed, || And the tent of the upright flourishes. 
There is a way—right before a man, || And its latter end are ways of death. 
Even in laughter is the heart pained, || And the latter end of joy is affliction. 
The backslider in heart is filled from his ways, || And a good man—from his fruits. 
The simple gives credence to everything, || And the prudent attends to his step. 
The wise is fearing and turning from evil, || And a fool is transgressing and is confident. 
Whoever is short of temper does folly, || And a man of wicked schemes is hated. 
The simple have inherited folly, || And the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 
The evil have bowed down before the good, || And the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 
The poor is hated even of his neighbor, || And those loving the rich are many. 
Whoever is despising his neighbor sins, || Whoever is favoring the humble, || O his blessedness. 
Do they who are devising evil not err? And kindness and truth are to those devising good, 
In all labor there is advantage, || And a thing of the lips is only to want. 
The crown of the wise is their wealth, || The folly of fools is folly. 
A true witness is delivering souls, || And a deceitful one breathes out lies. 
Strong confidence is in the fear of YHWH, || And there is a refuge to His sons. 
The fear of YHWH is a fountain of life, || To turn aside from snares of death. 
The honor of a king is in the multitude of a people, || And the ruin of a prince in lack of people. 
Whoever is slow to anger is of great understanding, || And whoever is short in temper is exalting folly. 
A healed heart is life to the flesh, || And rottenness to the bones is envy. 
An oppressor of the poor reproaches his Maker, || And whoever is honoring Him || Is favoring the needy. 
The wicked is driven away in his wickedness, || And the righteous is trustful in his death. 
Wisdom rests in the heart of the intelligent. And it is known in the midst of fools. 
Righteousness exalts a nation, || And the righteousness of peoples is a sin-offering. 
The favor of a king is to a wise servant, || And one causing shame is an object of his wrath!
