Isaiah.
Chapter 34.
Come near, you nations, to hear, || And you peoples, give attention, || The earth and its fullness hear, || The world, and all its productions. 
For to YHWH is wrath against all the nations, || And fury against all their host, || He has devoted them to destruction, || He has given them to slaughter. 
And their wounded are cast out, || And their carcasses cause their stench to ascend, || And mountains have been melted from their blood. 
And all the host of the heavens have been consumed, || And the heavens have been rolled together as a scroll, || And all their hosts fade, || As the fading of a leaf of a vine, || And as the fading one of a fig tree. 
For My sword was soaked in the heavens, || Behold, it comes down on Edom, || On the people of My curse for judgment. 
A sword is to YHWH—it has been full of blood, || It has been made fat with fatness, || With blood of lambs and male goats. With fat of kidneys of rams, || For to YHWH is a sacrifice in Bozrah, || And a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 
And reems have come down with them, || And bullocks with bulls, || And their land has been soaked from blood, || And their dust is made fat from fatness. 
(For a day of vengeance is to YHWH, || A year of recompenses for Zion’s strife), 
And her streams have been turned to pitch, || And her dust to brimstone, || And her land has become burning pitch. 
She is not quenched by night and by day, || Her smoke goes up for all time, || She is desolate from generation to generation, || Forever and ever, none is passing into her. 
And pelican and hedgehog possess her, || And owl and raven dwell in her, || And He has stretched out over her || A line of vacancy, and stones of emptiness. 
They call her nobles to the kingdom, || But there are none there, || And all her princes are at an end. 
And thorns have gone up her palaces, || Nettle and bramble are in her fortresses, || And it has been a habitation of dragons, || A court for daughters of an ostrich. 
And desert-dwellers have met with howlers, || And the goat calls for its companion, || Surely the night-owl has rested there, || And has found a place of rest for herself. 
The owl has made her nest there, || Indeed, she lays, and has hatched, || And has gathered under her shadow, || Surely vultures have been gathered there, || Each with its companion. 
Seek out of the scroll of YHWH, and read, || One of these has not been lacking, || None has missed its companion, || For My mouth—it has commanded, || And His Spirit—He has gathered them. 
And He has cast a lot for them, || And His hand has apportioned it to them by line, || They possess it for all time, || They dwell in it from generation to generation!
