Psalms.
Chapter 110.
A PSALM OF DAVID. A declaration of YHWH to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand, || Until I make Your enemies Your footstool.” 
YHWH sends the rod of Your strength from Zion, || Rule in the midst of Your enemies. 
Your people are free-will gifts in the day of Your strength, in the honors of holiness, || From the womb, from the morning, || You have the dew of Your youth. 
YHWH has sworn, and does not relent, “You are a priest for all time, || According to the order of Melchizedek.” 
The Lord on Your right hand struck kings || In the day of His anger. 
He judges among the nations, || He has completed the carcasses, || Has struck the head over the mighty earth. 
He drinks from a brook in the way, || Therefore He lifts up the head!
