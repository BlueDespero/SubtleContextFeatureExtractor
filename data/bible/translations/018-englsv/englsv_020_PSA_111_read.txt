Psalms.
Chapter 111.
Praise YAH! ALEPH-BET I thank YHWH with the whole heart, || In the secret meeting of the upright, || And of the congregation. 
Great are the works of YHWH, || Sought out by all desiring them. 
Splendid and majestic is His work, || And His righteousness is standing forever. 
He has made a memorial of His wonders, || YHWH is gracious and merciful. 
He has given prey to those fearing Him, || He remembers His covenant for all time. 
He has declared the power of His works to His people, || To give to them the inheritance of nations. 
The works of His hands are true and just, || All His appointments are steadfast. 
They are sustained forever and for all time. They are made in truth and uprightness. 
He has sent redemption to His people, || He has appointed His covenant for all time, || His Name is holy and fearful. 
The fear of YHWH is the beginning of wisdom, || Good understanding have all doing them, || His praise is standing forever!
