Psalms.
Chapter 47.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. All you peoples, clap the hand, || Shout to God with a voice of singing, 
For YHWH Most High is fearful, || A great King over all the earth. 
He leads peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 
He chooses for us our inheritance, || The excellence of Jacob that He loves. Selah. 
God has gone up with a shout, || YHWH with the sound of a horn. 
Praise God—praise—give praise to our king, praise. 
For God is King of all the earth, || Give praise, O understanding one. 
God has reigned over nations, God has sat on His holy throne, 
Nobles of peoples have been gathered, || With the people of the God of Abraham, || For the shields of earth are to God, || Greatly has He been exalted!
