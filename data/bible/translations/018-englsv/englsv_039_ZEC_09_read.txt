Zechariah.
Chapter 9.
The burden of a word of YHWH against the land of Hadrach, and Demmeseh—his place of rest: (When to YHWH is the eye of man, || And of all the tribes of Israel). 
And also Hamath borders thereon, || Tyre and Sidon, for—very wise! 
And Tyre builds a bulwark for herself, || And heaps silver as dust, || And gold as mire of out-places. 
Behold, the Lord dispossesses her, || And He has struck her force in the sea, || And she is consumed with fire. 
Ashkelon sees and fears, || Also Gaza, and she is exceedingly pained, || Also Ekron—for her expectation dried up, || And a king has perished from Gaza, || And Ashkelon does not remain, 
“And a foreigner has dwelt in Ashdod, || And I have cut off the excellence of the Philistines. 
And turned aside his blood from his mouth, || His abominations from between his teeth, || And he has remained, even he, to our God, || And he has been as a leader in Judah, || And Ekron as a Jebusite. 
And I have pitched a camp for My house, || Because of the passer through, and of the returner, || And an exactor does not pass through against them again, || For now, I have seen with My eyes. 
Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Zion, || Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem, || Behold, your King comes to you, || Righteous and having salvation, || Afflicted—and riding on a donkey, || And on a colt—a son of female donkeys. 
And I have cut off the chariot from Ephraim, || And the horse from Jerusalem, || Indeed, the bow of battle has been cut off, || And He has spoken peace to nations, || And His rule is from sea to sea, || And from the river to the ends of the earth. 
Also You—by the blood of Your covenant, || I have sent Your prisoners out of the pit, || There is no water in it. 
Return to a stronghold, || You prisoners of the hope, || Even today a second announcer I restore to you. 
For I have trodden for Myself with Judah, || I have filled a bow with Ephraim, || And I have stirred up your sons, O Zion, || Against your sons, O Javan, || And I have set you as the sword of a hero.” 
And YHWH appears for them, || And His arrow has gone forth as lightning, || And Lord YHWH blows with a horn, || And He has gone with whirlwinds of the south. 
YHWH of Hosts covers them over, || And they consumed, and subdued sling-stones, || Indeed, they have drunk, || They have made a noise as wine, || And they have been full as a bowl, || As corners of an altar. 
And their God YHWH has saved them in that day, || As a flock of His people, || For stones of a crown are displaying themselves over His ground. 
For what His goodness! And what His beauty! Grain the young men, || And new wine the virgins—make fruitful!
