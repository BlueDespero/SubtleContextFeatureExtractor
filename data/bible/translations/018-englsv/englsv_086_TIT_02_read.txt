Titus.
Chapter 2.
But you—speak what is suitable according to the sound teaching. 
Elders are to be temperate, dignified, sober, sound in faith, in the love, in the endurance. 
Aged women, in like manner, in behavior as becomes sacred persons, not false accusers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of good things, 
that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, 
sober, pure, keepers of their own houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that evil may not be spoken of the word of God. 
The younger men, in like manner, exhort them to be sober-minded. 
Concerning all things, present yourself as a pattern of good works—in the teaching with uncorruptedness, dignity, 
sound discourse that is blameless, so that he who is of the contrary may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you. 
Servants are to be subject to their own masters, to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, 
not stealing, but showing all good steadfastness, that the teaching of God our Savior they may adorn in all things. 
For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men, 
teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, we may live soberly, and righteously, and piously in the present age, 
waiting for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 
who gave Himself for us, that He might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to Himself a special people, zealous of good works. 
Speak these things, and exhort and convict with all authority; let no one despise you!
