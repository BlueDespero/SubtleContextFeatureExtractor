Psalms.
Chapter 35.
BY DAVID. Strive, YHWH, with my strivers, fight with my fighters, 
Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help, 
And draw out spear and lance, || To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.” 
They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, || Turned backward and confounded, || Those devising my evil. 
They are as chaff before wind, || And a messenger of YHWH driving away. 
Their way is darkness and slipperiness, || And a messenger of YHWH—their pursuer. 
For without cause they hid their net in a pit for me, || Without cause they dug for my soul. 
Desolation meets him—he does not know, || And his net that he hid catches him, || He falls into it for desolation. 
And my soul is joyful in YHWH, || It rejoices in His salvation. 
All my bones say, “YHWH, who is like You, || Delivering the poor from the one stronger than he, || And the poor and needy from his plunderer.” 
Violent witnesses rise up, || That which I have not known they ask me. 
They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul, 
And I—in their sickness my clothing is sackcloth, || I have humbled my soul with fastings, || And my prayer returns to my bosom. 
As if a friend, as if my brother, || I habitually walked, || As a mourner for a mother, || I have bowed down mourning. 
And they have rejoiced in my halting, || And have been gathered together, || The strikers were gathered against me, || And I have not known, || They have torn, and they have not ceased; 
With profane ones, mockers in feasts, || Gnashing their teeth against me. 
Lord, how long do You behold? Keep my soul back from their desolations, || My only one from young lions. 
I thank You in a great assembly, || I praise You among a mighty people. 
Do not let my enemies rejoice over me with falsehood, || Those hating me without cause wink the eye. 
For they do not speak peace, || And against the quiet of the land, || They devise deceitful words, 
And they enlarge their mouth against me, || They said, “Aha, aha, our eye has seen.” 
You have seen, O YHWH, || Do not be silent, O Lord—do not be far from me, 
Stir up, and wake to my judgment, || My God, and my Lord, to my plea. 
Judge me according to Your righteousness, O YHWH my God, || And they do not rejoice over me. 
They do not say in their heart, “Aha, our desire.” They do not say, “We swallowed him up.” 
They are ashamed and confounded together, || Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, || Who are magnifying themselves against me. 
They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, || And they continually say, “YHWH is magnified, || Who is desiring the peace of His servant.” 
And my tongue utters Your righteousness, || All the day Your praise!
