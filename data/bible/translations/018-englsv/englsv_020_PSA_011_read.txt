Psalms.
Chapter 11.
TO THE OVERSEER. BY DAVID. In YHWH I trusted, how do you say to my soul, “They moved to your mountain as the bird?” 
For behold, the wicked bend a bow, || They have prepared their arrow on the string, || To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 
When the foundations are destroyed, || The righteous—what has he done? 
YHWH is in His holy temple: YHWH—His throne is in the heavens. His eyes see—His eyelids try the sons of men. 
YHWH tries the righteous. And the wicked and the lover of violence, || His soul has hated, 
He pours on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, || And a horrible wind is the portion of their cup. 
For YHWH is righteous, || He has loved righteousness, || His countenance sees the upright!
