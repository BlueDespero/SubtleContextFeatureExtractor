The First Letter of Paul to the Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! 
We always give thanks to God for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, 
unceasingly remembering your work of faith, and the labor of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father, 
having known, beloved brothers, by God, your divine selection, 
because our good news did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you have known of what sort we became among you for your sake, 
and you became imitators of us and of the LORD, having received the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit, 
so that you became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia, 
for from you has sounded forth the word of the LORD, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God went forth, so that we have no need to say anything, 
for they themselves declare concerning us what entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from the idols, to serve a living and true God, 
and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He raised out of the dead—Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming.
