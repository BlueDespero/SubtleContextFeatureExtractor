1 Peter.
Chapter 4.
Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind, because he who suffered in the flesh has finished with sin, 
no longer in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to live the rest of the time in the flesh; 
for the time has sufficiently passed to have carried out the will of the nations, having walked in licentiousness, lusts, excesses of wines, revelings, drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries, 
in which they think it strange—your not running with them to the same excess of wastefulness, slandering you— 
who will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead, 
for this also was good news proclaimed to dead men, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, but may live according to God in the Spirit. 
Now the end of all things has come near; be sober-minded, then, and be sober in your prayers. 
Before all things, having earnest love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins; 
be hospitable to one another, without murmuring; 
each one, according as he received a gift, ministering it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God; 
if anyone speaks, speak as oracles of God; if anyone ministers, minister as of the strength which God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power through the ages of the ages. Amen. 
Beloved, do not think it strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you, 
but according as you have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice, that you may also rejoice in the revelation of His glory—exulting; 
if you are reproached in the Name of Christ—you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you; in regard, indeed, to them, is evil spoken of Him, and in regard to you, He is glorified; 
for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or as a meddler into other men’s matters; 
and if as a Christian, do not let him be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this respect; 
because it is the time of the judgment to have begun from the house of God, and if first from us, what is the end of those disobedient to the good news of God? 
And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and sinner appear? 
So that those also suffering according to the will of God, as to a steadfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in doing good.
