Zechariah.
Chapter 3.
And he shows me Joshua the high priest standing before the Messenger of YHWH, and Satan standing at his right hand, to be an adversary to him. 
And YHWH says to Satan: “YHWH pushes against you, O Satan, || Indeed, YHWH pushes against you, || Who is fixing on Jerusalem, || Is this not a brand delivered from fire?” 
And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and is standing before the Messenger. 
And He answers and speaks to those standing before Him, saying, “Turn aside the filthy garments from off him.” And He says to him, “See, I have caused your iniquity to pass away from off you, so as to clothe you with costly apparel.” 
He also said, “Let them set a pure turban on his head.” And they set the pure turban on his head, and clothe him with garments. And the Messenger of YHWH is standing, 
and the Messenger of YHWH protests to Joshua, saying, 
“Thus said YHWH of Hosts: If you walk in My ways, || And if you keep My charge, || Then also you judge My house, || And also you keep My courts, || And I have given to you conductors among these standing by. 
Now hear, O Joshua the high priest, || You and your companions sitting before you || (For men of type are they), || For behold, I am bringing in My servant—a Shoot. 
For behold, the stone that I put before Joshua, || On one stone are seven eyes, || Behold, I am engraving its engraving, || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || And I have removed the iniquity of that land in one day. 
In that day—a declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || You call, each to his neighbor, || To the place of the vine, || And to the place of the fig tree!”
