Isaiah.
Chapter 57.
The righteous has perished, || And there is none laying it to heart, || And men of kindness are gathered, || Without any considering that from the face of evil || The righteous one is gathered. 
He enters into peace, they rest on their beds, || Each is going straightforward. 
“And you, come near here, || O sons of a sorceress, seed of an adulterer, || Even you commit whoredom. 
Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you enlarge the mouth || And prolong the tongue? Are you not children of transgression? A false seed? 
Who are inflamed among oaks, under every green tree, || Slaughtering the children in valleys, || Under clefts of the rocks. 
Your portion is among the smooth things of a brook, || They are your lot, || You have also poured out an oblation to them, || You have caused a present to ascend, || Am I comforted in these things? 
On a mountain, high and exalted, || You have set your bed, || You have also gone up there to make a sacrifice. 
And behind the door, and the post, || You have set up your memorial, || For you have removed from Me, and go up, || You have enlarged your bed, || And cut a covenant with them, || You have loved their bed, the station you saw, 
And go joyfully to the king in ointment, || And multiply your perfumes, || And send your ambassadors far off, || And humble yourself to Sheol. 
You have labored in the greatness of your way, || You have not said, It is desperate. You have found the life of your hand, || Therefore you have not been sick. 
And of whom have you been afraid, and fear, || That you lie, and have not remembered Me? You have not laid it to your heart, || Am I not silent, even from of old? And you do not fear Me? 
I declare your righteousness, and your works, || And they do not profit you. 
When you cry, let your gatherings deliver you, || And wind carries all of them away, || Vanity takes away, || And whoever is trusting in Me inherits the land, || And possesses My holy mountain.” 
And He has said, “Raise up, raise up, prepare a way, || Lift a stumbling-block out of the way of My people.” 
For thus said the high and exalted One, || Inhabiting eternity, and His Name is holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, || And with the bruised and humble of spirit, || To revive the spirit of the humble, || And to revive the heart of bruised ones, 
For I do not strive for all time, nor am I angry forever, || For the spirit is feeble before Me, || And the souls I have made. 
For the iniquity of his dishonest gain, || I have been angry, and I strike him, || Hiding—and am angry, || And he goes on turning back in the way of his heart. 
I have seen his ways, and I heal him, indeed, I lead him, || And repay comforts to him and to his mourning ones. 
Producing the fruit of the lips, || Peace, peace, to the far off, and to the near, || And I have healed him,” said YHWH. 
And the wicked are as the driven out sea, || For it is not able to rest, || And its waters cast out filth and mire. 
“There is no peace,” said my God, “for the wicked!”
