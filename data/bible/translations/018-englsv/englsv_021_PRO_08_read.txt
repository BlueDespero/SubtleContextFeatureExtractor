Proverbs.
Chapter 8.
Does wisdom not call? And understanding give forth her voice? 
At the head of high places by the way, || She has stood between the paths, 
At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, || The entrance of the openings, she cries aloud, 
“To you, O men, I call, || And my voice is to the sons of men. 
Understand, you simple ones, prudence, || And you fools, understand the heart, 
Listen, for I speak noble things, || And the opening of my lips is uprightness. 
For my mouth utters truth, || And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 
All the sayings of my mouth are in righteousness, || Nothing in them is contrary and perverse. 
All of them are plain to the intelligent, || And upright to those finding knowledge. 
Receive my instruction, and not silver, || And knowledge rather than choice gold. 
For wisdom is better than rubies, || Indeed, all delights are not comparable with it. 
I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, || And I find out a knowledge of purposes. 
The fear of YHWH is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, || And a contrary mouth, I have hated. 
Counsel and substance are mine, || I am understanding, I have might. 
By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness, 
By me chiefs rule, and nobles, || All judges of earth. 
I love those loving me, || And those seeking me earnestly find me. 
Wealth and honor are with me, || Lasting substance and righteousness. 
My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, || And my increase than choice silver. 
I cause to walk in a path of righteousness, || In midst of paths of judgment, 
To cause my lovers to inherit substance, || Indeed, I fill their treasures. 
YHWH possessed me—the beginning of His way, || Before His works since then. 
I was anointed from the age, from the first, || From former states of the earth. 
In there being no depths, I was brought forth, || In there being no fountains heavy with waters, 
Before mountains were sunk, || Before heights, I was brought forth. 
While He had not made the earth, and out-places, || And the top of the dusts of the world. 
In His preparing the heavens I am there, || In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep, 
In His strengthening clouds above, || In His making strong fountains of the deep, 
In His setting for the sea its limit, || And the waters do not transgress His command, || In His decreeing the foundations of earth, 
Then I am near Him, a workman, || And I am a delight—day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times, 
Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, || And my delights are with the sons of men. 
And now, you sons, listen to me, || Indeed, blessed are they who keep my ways. 
Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not slight. 
O the blessedness of the man listening to me, || To watch at my doors day by day, || To watch at the doorposts of my entrance. 
For whoever is finding me, has found life, || And brings out goodwill from YHWH. 
And whoever is missing me, is wronging his soul, || All hating me have loved death!”
