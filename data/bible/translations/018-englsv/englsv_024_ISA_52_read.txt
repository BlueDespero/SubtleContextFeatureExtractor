Isaiah.
Chapter 52.
Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion, || Put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem—the Holy City; For the uncircumcised and unclean no longer enter into you again. 
Shake yourself from dust, arise, sit, O Jerusalem, || Bands of your neck have loosed themselves, || O captive daughter of Zion. 
For thus said YHWH: “You have been sold for nothing, || And you are redeemed without money.” 
For thus said Lord YHWH: “My people went down at first || To Egypt to sojourn there, || And Asshur—he has oppressed it for nothing. 
And now, what have I here,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “That My people are taken for nothing? Its rulers cause howling,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “And My Name is continually despised all the day. 
Therefore My people know My Name, || Therefore, in that day, || Surely I am He who is speaking, behold Me.” 
How lovely on the mountains, || Have been the feet of one proclaiming tidings, || Sounding peace, proclaiming good tidings, || Sounding salvation, || Saying to Zion, “Your God has reigned.” 
The voice of your watchmen! They have lifted up the voice, together they cry aloud, || Because they see eye to eye, || In YHWH’s turning back to Zion. 
Break forth, sing together, || O ruins of Jerusalem, || For YHWH has comforted His people, || He has redeemed Jerusalem. 
YHWH has made His holy arm bare || Before the eyes of all the nations, || And all the ends of the earth have seen || The salvation of our God. 
Turn aside, turn aside, go out from there, || Do not touch the unclean, || Go out from her midst, || Be pure, who are carrying the weapons of YHWH. 
For you do not go out in haste, || Indeed, you do not go on with flight, || For YHWH is going before you, || And the God of Israel is gathering you! 
“Behold, My Servant acts wisely, || He is high, and has been lifted up, || And has been very high.” 
As many have been astonished at You || (His appearance so marred by man, || And His form by sons of men), 
So He sprinkles many nations. Kings shut their mouth concerning Him, || For that which was not recounted to them they have seen, || And that which they had not heard they have understood!
