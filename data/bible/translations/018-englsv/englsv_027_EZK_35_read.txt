Ezekiel.
Chapter 35.
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
and you have said to it, Thus said Lord YHWH: Behold, I am against you, O Mount Seir, || And have stretched out My hand against you, || And made you a desolation and an astonishment. 
I make your cities a ruin, and you are a desolation, || And you have known that I am YHWH. 
Because of your having continuous enmity, || And you saw the sons of Israel, || By the hands of the sword, || In the time of their calamity, || In the time of the iniquity of the end: 
Therefore, as I live—a declaration of Lord YHWH, || Surely I appoint you for blood, || And blood pursues you, || If you have not hated blood, || Blood also pursues you. 
And I have given Mount Seir for a desolation and an astonishment, || And have cut off from it him who is passing over and him who is returning, 
And filled his mountains with his wounded, || Your hills, and your valleys, and all your streams, || The pierced of the sword fall into them. 
I make you continuous desolations, || And your cities do not return, || And you have known that I am YHWH. 
Because of your saying: The two nations and the two lands are mine, and we have possessed it, || And YHWH has been there; 
Therefore, as I live—a declaration of Lord YHWH, || And I have done according to your anger, || And according to your envy, || With which you have worked, || Because of your hatred against them, || And I have been known among them when I judge you. 
And you have known that I am YHWH, || I have heard all your despisings that you have spoken || Against mountains of Israel, saying, || A desolation—they were given to us for food. 
And you magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth, || And have made your words abundant against Me; I have heard. 
Thus said Lord YHWH: According to the rejoicing of the whole land, || I make a desolation of you. 
According to your joy at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, || So I do to you—you are a desolation, || O Mount Seir, and all Edom—all of it, || And they have known that I am YHWH!”
