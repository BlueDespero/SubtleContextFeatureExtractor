Psalms.
Chapter 44.
TO THE OVERSEER. AN INSTRUCTION OF THE SONS OF KORAH. O God, we have heard with our ears, || Our fathers have recounted to us, || The work You worked in their days, || In the days of old. 
You, with Your hand, have dispossessed nations. And You plant them. You afflict peoples, and send them away. 
For they did not possess the land by their sword, || And their arm did not give salvation to them, || But Your right hand, and Your arm, || And the light of Your countenance, || Because You had accepted them. 
You are He, my King, O God, || Command the deliverances of Jacob. 
By You we push our adversaries, || By Your Name we tread down our withstanders, 
For I do not trust in my bow, || And my sword does not save me. 
For You have saved us from our adversaries, || And You have put to shame those hating us. 
In God we have boasted all the day, || And we thank Your Name for all time. Selah. 
In anger You have cast off and cause us to blush, || And do not go forth with our hosts. 
You cause us to turn backward from an adversary, || And those hating us, || Have spoiled for themselves. 
You make us food like sheep, || And You have scattered us among nations. 
You sell Your people—without wealth, || And have not become great by their price. 
You make us a reproach to our neighbors, || A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders. 
You make us an allegory among nations, || A shaking of the head among peoples. 
All the day my confusion is before me, || And the shame of my face has covered me. 
Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler, || Because of an enemy and a self-avenger. 
All this met us, and we did not forget You, || Nor have we dealt falsely in Your covenant. 
We do not turn our heart backward, || Nor turn aside our step from Your path. 
But You have struck us in a place of dragons, || And cover us over with death-shade. 
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, || And spread our hands to a strange God, 
Does God not search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart. 
Surely, for Your sake we have been slain all the day, || Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter. 
Stir up—why do You sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not cast us off forever. 
Why do You hide Your face? You forget our afflictions and our oppression, 
For our soul has bowed to the dust, || Our belly has cleaved to the earth. 
Arise, a help to us, || And ransom us for your kindness’ sake.
