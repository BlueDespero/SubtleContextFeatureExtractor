Psalms.
Chapter 5.
TO THE OVERSEER. BLOWN INTO THE PIPES. A PSALM OF DAVID. Hear my sayings, O YHWH, || Consider my meditation. 
Be attentive to the voice of my cry, || My King and my God, || For I pray to You habitually. 
YHWH, in the morning You hear my voice, || In the morning I set in array for You, || And I look out expectantly. 
For You are not a God desiring wickedness, || Evil does not inhabit You. 
The boastful do not station themselves before Your eyes: You have hated all working iniquity. 
You destroy those speaking lies, || YHWH detests a man of blood and deceit. 
And I, in the abundance of Your kindness, || I enter Your house, || I bow myself toward Your holy temple in Your fear. 
O YHWH, lead me in Your righteousness, || Because of those observing me, || Make Your way straight before me, 
For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart is mischiefs, || Their throat is an open grave, || They make their tongue smooth. 
Declare them guilty, O God, || Let them fall from their own counsels, || In the abundance of their transgressions || Drive them away, || Because they have been rebellious against You. 
And all trusting in You rejoice, || They sing for all time, and You cover them over, || And those loving Your Name exult in You. 
For You bless the righteous, O YHWH, || Surrounding him with favor as a buckler!
