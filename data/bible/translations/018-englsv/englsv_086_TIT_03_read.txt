Titus.
Chapter 3.
Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, to be ready to every good work, 
to speak evil of no one, not to be quarrelsome—gentle, showing all meekness to all men, 
for we, also, were once thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving manifold desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, odious—hating one another; 
and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Savior appeared 
(not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness), He saved us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit, 
which He poured on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
that having been declared righteous by His grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of continuous life. 
The word is steadfast; and concerning these things I intend you to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works—who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men, 
but stand away from foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law—for they are unprofitable and vain. 
Reject a heretical man, after a first and second admonition, 
having known that he has been subverted who is such, and sins, being self-condemned. 
When I will send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. 
Diligently send forth Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking, 
and let them learn—ours also—to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 
All those with me greet you. Greet those cherishing us in faith. The grace is with you all!
