1 Corinthians.
Chapter 8.
And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love builds up; 
and if anyone thinks to know anything, he has not yet known anything according as it is required to know; 
and if anyone loves God, this one has been known by Him. 
Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one; 
for even if there are those called gods, whether in Heaven, whether on earth—as there are many gods and many lords— 
yet to us is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him; 
but not in all men is the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, until now, eat it as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
But food does not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind; 
but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the weak, 
for if anyone may see you that have knowledge in an idol’s temple reclining to eat, will not his conscience—he being weak—be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols? 
For the one being weak—the brother for whom Christ died—will perish by your knowledge. 
And thus sinning in regard to the brothers, and striking their weak conscience—you sin in regard to Christ; 
for this reason, if food causes my brother to stumble, I may not eat flesh—throughout the age—that I may not cause my brother to stumble.
