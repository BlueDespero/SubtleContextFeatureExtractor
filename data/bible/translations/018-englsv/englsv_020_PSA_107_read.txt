Psalms.
Chapter 107.
“Give thanks to YHWH, || For He is good, for His kindness is for all time”: 
Let the redeemed of YHWH say so, || Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary. 
And has gathered them from the lands, || From east and from west, || From north, and from the sea. 
They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, || They have not found a city of habitation. 
Hungry—indeed—thirsty, || Their soul becomes feeble in them, 
And they cry to YHWH in their adversity, || He delivers them from their distress, 
And causes them to tread in a right way, || To go to a city of habitation. 
They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men. 
For He has satisfied a longing soul, || And has filled a hungry soul with goodness. 
Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, || Prisoners of affliction and of iron, 
Because they changed the saying of God, || And despised the counsel of the Most High. 
And He humbles their heart with labor, || They have been feeble, and there is no helper. 
And they cry to YHWH in their adversity, || He saves them from their distresses. 
He brings them out from the dark place, || And death-shade, || And He draws away their bands. 
They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men. 
For He has broken doors of bronze, || And He has cut bars of iron. 
Fools, by means of their transgression, || And by their iniquities, afflict themselves. 
Their soul detests all food, || And they come near to the gates of death, 
And cry to YHWH in their adversity, || He saves them from their distresses, 
He sends His word and heals them, || And delivers them from their destructions. 
They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men, 
And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, || And recount His works with singing. 
Those going down to the sea in ships, || Doing business in many waters, 
They have seen the works of YHWH, || And His wonders in the deep. 
And He commands, and appoints a storm, || And it lifts up its billows, 
They go up to the heavens, they go down to the depths, || Their soul is melted in evil. 
They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, || And all their wisdom is swallowed up. 
And they cry to YHWH in their adversity, || And He brings them out from their distresses. 
He calms a whirlwind, || And their billows are hushed. 
And they rejoice because they are quiet, || And He leads them to the haven of their desire. 
They confess to YHWH His kindness, || And His wonders to the sons of men, 
And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, || And praise Him in the seat of the elderly. 
He makes rivers become a wilderness, || And fountains of waters become dry land. 
A fruitful land becomes a barren place, || For the wickedness of its inhabitants. 
He makes a wilderness become a pool of water, || And a dry land become fountains of waters. 
And He causes the hungry to dwell there, || And they prepare a city of habitation. 
And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, || And they make fruits of increase. 
And He blesses them, and they multiply exceedingly, || And He does not diminish their livestock. 
And they are diminished, and bow down, || By restraint, evil, and sorrow. 
He is pouring contempt on nobles, || And causes them to wander in vacancy—no way. 
And sets the needy on high from affliction, || And places families as a flock. 
The upright see and rejoice, || And all perversity has shut her mouth. 
Who is wise, and observes these? They understand the kind acts of YHWH!
