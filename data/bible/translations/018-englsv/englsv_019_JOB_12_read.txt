Job.
Chapter 12.
And Job answers and says: 
“Truly—you are the people, and wisdom dies with you. 
I also have a heart like you, I am not fallen more than you, || And with whom is there not like these? 
I am a laughter to his friend: He calls to God, and He answers him, || A laughter is the perfect righteous one. 
A torch—despised in the thoughts of the secure || Is prepared for those sliding with the feet. 
The tents of spoilers are at peace, || And those provoking God have confidence, || Into whose hand God has brought. 
And yet, now ask one of the beasts, || And it shows you, || And a bird of the heavens, || And it declares to you. 
Or talk to the earth, and it shows you, || And fishes of the sea recount to you: 
Who has not known in all these, || That the hand of YHWH has done this? 
In whose hand is the breath of every living thing, || And the spirit of all flesh of man. 
Does the ear not try words? And the palate taste food for itself? 
With the very aged is wisdom, || And with length of days is understanding. 
With Him are wisdom and might, || To Him are counsel and understanding. 
Behold, He breaks down, and it is not built up, || He shuts against a man, || And it is not opened. 
Behold, He keeps in the waters, and they are dried up, || And He sends them forth, || And they overturn the land. 
With Him are strength and wisdom, || His the deceived and deceiver. 
Causing counselors to go away as a spoil, || Indeed, He makes fools of judges. 
He has opened the bands of kings, || And He binds a girdle on their loins. 
Causing ministers to go away as a spoil || And strong ones He overthrows. 
Turning aside the lip of the steadfast, || And the reason of the aged He takes away. 
Pouring contempt on princes, || And the girdle of the mighty He made feeble. 
Removing deep things out of darkness, || And He brings out to light death-shade. 
Magnifying the nations, and He destroys them, || Spreading out the nations, and He quiets them. 
Turning aside the heart || Of the heads of the people of the land, || And He causes them to wander || In vacancy—no way! 
They feel darkness, and not light, || He causes them to wander as a drunkard.”
