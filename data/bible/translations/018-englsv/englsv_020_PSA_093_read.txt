Psalms.
Chapter 93.
YHWH has reigned, || He has put on excellence, || YHWH put on strength, He girded Himself, || Also—the world is established, unmoved. 
Your throne is established since then, || You are from the age. 
Floods have lifted up, O YHWH, || Floods have lifted up their voice, || Floods lift up their breakers. 
Mightier than the voices of many mighty waters, breakers of a sea, || Is YHWH on high, 
Your testimonies have been very steadfast, || Holiness befits Your house, O YHWH, for the length of Your days!
