Acts.
Chapter 14.
And it came to pass in Iconium, that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke, so that there believed a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks; 
and the unbelieving Jews stirred up and made the souls of the nations evil against the brothers; 
for a long time, indeed, therefore, they abided speaking boldly in the LORD, who is testifying to the word of His grace, and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their hands. 
And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles, 
and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the Jews with their rulers to mistreat them, and to stone them, 
they having become aware, fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding region, 
and there they were proclaiming good news. 
And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother—who never had walked; 
this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having steadfastly beheld him, and having seen that he has faith to be saved, 
said with a loud voice, “Stand up on your feet upright”; and he was springing and walking, 
and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, lifted up their voice in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, “The gods, having become like men, came down to us”; 
they were also calling Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, since he was the leader in speaking. 
And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, having brought oxen and garlands to the porches, wished to sacrifice with the multitudes, 
and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having torn their garments, sprung into the multitude, crying 
and saying, “Men, why do you do these things? And we are similar-feeling men with you, proclaiming good news to you, to turn to the living God from these vanities, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them; 
who in the past generations permitted all the nations to go on in their ways, 
though, indeed, He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good—giving rains to us from Heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness”; 
and saying these things, they scarcely restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them. 
And there came there, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be dead; 
and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he entered into the city, and on the next day he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. 
Having also proclaimed good news to that city, and having discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch, 
confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain in the faith, and that it is required of us to enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations, 
and having appointed to them elders in every assembly by vote, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to the LORD in whom they had believed. 
And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia, 
and having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, 
and from there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been given by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled; 
and having come and gathered the assembly together, they declared as many things as God did with them, and that He opened a door of faith to the nations; 
and they abided there with the disciples for not a short time.
