Psalms.
Chapter 122.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, “We go to the house of YHWH.” 
Our feet have been standing in your gates, O Jerusalem! 
Jerusalem—the built one—Is as a city that is joined to itself together. 
For there tribes have gone up, || Tribes of YAH, companies of Israel, || To give thanks to the Name of YHWH. 
For there thrones of judgment have sat, || Thrones of the house of David. 
Ask for the peace of Jerusalem, || Those loving you are at rest. 
Peace is in your bulwark, rest in your high places, 
For the sake of my brothers and my companions, || Please let me speak, “Peace be in you.” 
For the sake of the house of our God YHWH, || I seek good for you!
