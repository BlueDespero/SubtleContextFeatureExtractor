Hosea.
Chapter 7.
“When I give healing to Israel, || Then the iniquity of Ephraim is revealed, || And the wickedness of Samaria, || For they have worked falsehood, || And a thief comes in, || A troop has stripped off in the street, 
And they do not say to their heart, || That I have remembered all their evil, || Now their doings have surrounded them, || They have been before My face. 
With their wickedness they make a king glad, || And with their lies—princes. 
All of them are adulterers, || Like a burning oven of a baker, || He ceases from stirring up after kneading the dough, until its leavening. 
A day of our king! Princes have defiled themselves with the poison of wine, || He has drawn out his hand with scorners. 
For they have drawn near, || Their heart is as an oven || In their lying in wait—their baker sleeps all night, || Morning! He is burning as a flaming fire. 
All of them are warm as an oven, || And they have devoured their judges, || All their kings have fallen, || There is none calling to Me among them. 
Ephraim! He mixes himself among peoples, || Ephraim has been an unturned cake. 
Strangers have devoured his power, || And he has not known, || Also old age has sprinkled itself on him, || And he has not known. 
And the excellence of Israel has been humbled to his face, || And they have not turned back to their God YHWH, || Nor have they sought Him for all this. 
And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, || Egypt they called on—to Asshur they have gone. 
When they go I spread over them My net, || As the bird of the heavens I bring them down, || I discipline them as their congregation has heard. 
Woe to them, for they wandered from Me, || Destruction to them, for they transgressed against Me, || And I ransom them, and they have spoken lies against Me, 
And have not cried to Me with their heart, but howl on their beds; They assemble themselves for grain and new wine, || They turn aside against Me. 
And I instructed—I strengthened their arms, || And concerning Me they think evil! 
They turn back—not to the Most High, || They have been as a deceitful bow, || Their princes fall by sword, || From the insolence of their tongue, || This is their derision in the land of Egypt!”
