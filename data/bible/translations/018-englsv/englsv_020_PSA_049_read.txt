Psalms.
Chapter 49.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Hear this, all you peoples, || Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world. 
Both low and high, together rich and needy. 
My mouth speaks wise things, || And the meditations of my heart are things of understanding. 
I incline my ear to an allegory, || I open my riddle with a harp: 
Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters surrounds me. 
Those trusting on their wealth, || And in the multitude of their riches, || Show themselves foolish. 
A brother ransoms no one at all, || He does not give to God his atonement. 
And precious is the redemption of their soul, || And it has ceased for all time. 
And still he lives forever, || He does not see the pit. 
For he sees wise men die, || Together the foolish and brutish perish, || And have left their wealth to others. 
Their heart is that their houses are for all time, || Their dwelling places from generation to generation. They proclaimed their names over the lands. 
And man does not remain in honor, || He has been like the beasts, they have been cut off. 
This their way is folly for them, || And their posterity are pleased with their sayings. Selah. 
They have set themselves as sheep for Sheol, || Death afflicts them, || And the upright rule over them in the morning, || And their form is for consumption. Sheol is a dwelling for him. 
Only, God ransoms my soul from the hand of Sheol, || For He receives me. Selah. 
Do not fear when one makes wealth, || When the glory of his house is abundant, 
For at his death he receives nothing, || His glory does not go down after him. 
For he blesses his soul in his life || (And they praise you when you do well for yourself). 
It comes to the generation of his fathers, || They do not see the light forever. 
Man in honor, who does not understand, || Has been like the beasts, they have been cut off!
