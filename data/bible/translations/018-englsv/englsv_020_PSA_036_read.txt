Psalms.
Chapter 36.
TO THE OVERSEER. BY A SERVANT OF YHWH, BY DAVID. The transgression of the wicked || Is affirming within my heart, “Fear of God is not before his eyes, 
For he made it smooth to himself in his eyes, || To find his iniquity to be hated. 
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit, || He ceased to act prudently—to do good. 
He devises iniquity on his bed, || He stations himself on a way not good, || He does not refuse evil.” 
O YHWH, Your kindness is in the heavens, || Your faithfulness is to the clouds. 
Your righteousness is as mountains of God, || Your judgments are a great deep. You save man and beast, O YHWH. 
How precious is Your kindness, O God, || And the sons of men trust || In the shadow of Your wings. 
They are filled from the fatness of Your house, || And You cause them to drink the stream of Your delights. 
For a fountain of life is with You, || In Your light we see light. 
Draw out Your kindness to those knowing You, || And Your righteousness to the upright of heart. 
Do not let a foot of pride meet me, || And do not let a hand of the wicked move me. 
Workers of iniquity have fallen there, || They have been overthrown, || And have not been able to arise!
