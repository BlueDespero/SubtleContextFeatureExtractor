Psalms.
Chapter 132.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. Remember, YHWH, for David, all his afflictions; 
Who has sworn to YHWH, || He has vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 
“If I enter into the tent of my house, || If I go up on the couch of my bed, 
If I give sleep to my eyes, || To my eyelids—slumber, 
Until I find a place for YHWH, dwelling places for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 
Behold, we have heard it in Ephratah, || We have found it in the fields of the forest. 
We come into His dwelling places, || We bow ourselves at His footstool. 
Arise, O YHWH, to Your rest, || You, and the Ark of Your strength, 
Your priests put on righteousness, || And Your pious ones cry aloud. 
For the sake of Your servant David, || Do not turn back the face of Your anointed. 
YHWH has sworn truth to David, || He does not turn back from it: “Of the fruit of your body, || I set on the throne for you. 
If your sons keep My covenant, || And My testimonies that I teach them, || Their sons also forever and ever || Sit on the throne for you.” 
For YHWH has fixed on Zion, || He has desired it for a seat to Himself, 
“This is My rest forever and ever, || Here I sit, for I have desired it. 
I greatly bless her provision, || I satisfy her poor with bread, 
And I clothe her priests with salvation, || And her pious ones sing aloud. 
There I cause a horn to spring up for David, || I have arranged a lamp for My Anointed. 
I clothe His enemies with shame, || And His crown flourishes on Him!”
