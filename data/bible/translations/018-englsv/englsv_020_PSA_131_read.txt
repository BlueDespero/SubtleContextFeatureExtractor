Psalms.
Chapter 131.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. BY DAVID. YHWH, my heart has not been haughty, || Nor have my eyes been high, || Nor have I walked in great things, || And in things too wonderful for me. 
Have I not compared, and kept my soul silent, || As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me is my soul. 
Israel waits on YHWH, || From now on, and for all time!
