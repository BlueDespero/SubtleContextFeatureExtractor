Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise YAH! Sing to YHWH a new song, || His praise in an assembly of saints. 
Israel rejoices in his Maker, || Sons of Zion rejoice in their king. 
They praise His Name in a dance, || Sing praise to Him with timbrel and harp. 
For YHWH is pleased with His people, || He beautifies the humble with salvation. 
Saints exult in glory, || They sing aloud on their beds. 
The exaltation of God is in their throat, || And a two-edged sword in their hand. 
To do vengeance among nations, || Punishments among the peoples. 
To bind their kings with chains, || And their honored ones with chains of iron, 
To do among them the judgment written, || It is an honor for all his saints. Praise YAH!
