Psalms.
Chapter 106.
Praise YAH, give thanks to YHWH, for He is good, for His kindness is for all time! 
Who utters the mighty acts of YHWH? Sounds all His praise? 
O the blessedness of those keeping judgment, || Doing righteousness at all times. 
Remember me, O YHWH, || With the favor of Your people, || Look after me in Your salvation. 
To look on the good of Your chosen ones, || To rejoice in the joy of Your nation, || To boast myself with Your inheritance. 
We have sinned with our fathers, || We have done perversely, we have done wickedly. 
Our fathers in Egypt, || Have not considered wisely Your wonders, || They have not remembered || The abundance of Your kind acts, || And provoke by the sea, at the Sea of Suph. 
And He saves them for His Name’s sake, || To make His might known, 
And rebukes the Sea of Suph, and it is dried up, || And causes them to go || Through depths as a wilderness. 
And He saves them from the hand || Of him who is hating, || And redeems them from the hand of the enemy. 
And waters cover their adversaries, || One of them has not been left. 
And they believe in His words, they sing His praise, 
They have hurried—forgotten His works, || They have not waited for His counsel. 
And they lust greatly in a wilderness, || And try God in a desert. 
And He gives to them their request, || And sends leanness into their soul. 
And they are envious of Moses in the camp, || Of Aaron, YHWH’s holy one. 
Earth opens, and swallows up Dathan, || And covers over the company of Abiram. 
And fire burns among their company, || A flame sets the wicked on fire. 
They make a calf in Horeb, || And bow themselves to a molten image, 
And change their glory || Into the form of an ox eating herbs. 
They have forgotten God their Savior, || The doer of great things in Egypt, 
Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, || Of fearful things by the Sea of Suph. 
And He commands to destroy them, || Unless Moses, His chosen one, || Had stood in the breach before Him, || To turn back His wrath from destroying. 
And they kick against the desirable land, || They have not given credence to His word. 
And they murmur in their tents, || They have not listened to the voice of YHWH. 
And He lifts up His hand to them, || To cause them to fall in a wilderness, 
And to cause their seed to fall among nations, || And to scatter them through lands. 
And they are coupled to Ba‘al-Peor, || And eat the sacrifices of the dead, 
And they provoke to anger by their actions, || And a plague breaks forth on them, 
And Phinehas stands, and executes judgment, || And the plague is restrained, 
And it is reckoned to him for righteousness, || From generation to generation—for all time. 
And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, || And it is evil to Moses for their sakes, 
For they have provoked his spirit, || And he speaks wrongfully with his lips. 
They have not destroyed the peoples, || As YHWH had commanded to them, 
And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works, 
And serve their idols, || And they are for a snare to them. 
And they sacrifice their sons and their daughters to the demons, 
And they shed innocent blood—Blood of their sons and of their daughters, || Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, || And the land is profaned with blood. 
And they are defiled with their works, || And commit whoredom in their habitual doings. 
And the anger of YHWH || Is kindled against His people, || And He detests His inheritance. 
And gives them into the hand of nations, || And those hating them rule over them, 
And their enemies oppress them, || And they are humbled under their hand. 
He delivers them many times, || And they rebel in their counsel, || And they are brought low in their iniquity. 
And He looks on their distress || When He hears their cry, 
And remembers His covenant for them, || And is comforted, || According to the abundance of His kindness. 
And He appoints them for mercies || Before all their captors. 
Save us, O our God YHWH, and gather us from the nations, || To give thanks to Your Holy Name, || To glory in Your praise. 
Blessed is YHWH, God of Israel, || From age until age. And all the people said, “Amen, praise YAH!”
