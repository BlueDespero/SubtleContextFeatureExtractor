Psalms.
Chapter 53.
TO THE OVERSEER. “ON A DISEASE.” AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. A fool said in his heart, “There is no God.” They have done corruptly, || Indeed, they have done abominable iniquity, || There is none doing good. 
God looked on the sons of men from the heavens, || To see if there is an understanding one, || One seeking God. 
Everyone went back, together they became filthy, || There is none doing good—not even one. 
Workers of iniquity have not known, || Those eating my people have eaten bread, || They have not called God. 
There they feared a fear—there was no fear, || For God has scattered the bones of him || Who is encamping against you, || You have put to shame, || For God has despised them. 
Who gives the salvation of Israel from Zion? When God turns back to a captivity of His people, || Jacob rejoices—Israel is glad!
