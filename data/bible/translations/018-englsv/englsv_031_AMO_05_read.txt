Amos.
Chapter 5.
Hear this word that I am bearing to you, || A lamentation, O house of Israel: 
“Fallen, not to rise again, has the virgin of Israel, || Left on her land—she has none to raise her up.” 
For thus said Lord YHWH: “The city that is going out one thousand, || Leaves one hundred, || And that which is going out one hundred, || Leaves ten to the house of Israel.” 
For thus said YHWH to the house of Israel: “Seek Me, and live, 
And do not seek Beth-El, and do not enter Gilgal, || And do not pass through Beer-Sheba, || For Gilgal utterly removes, || And Beth-El becomes vanity. 
Seek YHWH, and live, || Lest He prosper as fire against the house of Joseph, || And it has consumed, || And there is no quencher for Beth-El— 
You who are turning judgment to wormwood, || And have put down righteousness to the earth!” 
The Maker of the Pleiades and Orion, || And He who is turning death-shade to the morning—And He has made day as dark as night—Who is calling to the waters of the sea, || And pours them on the face of the earth, || YHWH is His Name; 
Who is brightening up the spoiled against the strong, || And the spoiled comes against a fortress. 
They have hated a reprover in the gate, || And they detest a plain speaker. 
Therefore, because of your trampling on the poor, || And the tribute of grain you take from him, || Houses of hewn work you have built, || And you do not dwell in them, || Desirable vineyards you have planted, || And you do not drink their wine. 
For I have known—many are your transgressions, || And mighty your sins, || Adversaries of the righteous, taking ransoms, || And you turned aside the needy in the gate. 
Therefore the wise is silent at that time, || For it is an evil time. 
Seek good, and not evil, that you may live, and it is so; YHWH, God of Hosts, is with you, as you said. 
Hate evil, and love good, || And set up judgment in the gate, || It may be YHWH, God of Hosts, pities the remnant of Joseph. 
Therefore, thus said YHWH, God of Hosts, the Lord: “Lamentation is in all broad places, || And in all out-places they say, Oh! Oh! And called the farmer to mourning, || And the skillful of wailing to lamentation. 
And in all vineyards is lamentation, || For I pass into your midst,” said YHWH. 
Behold, you who are desiring the Day of YHWH, || Why is this to you—the Day of YHWH? It is darkness, and not light, 
As when one flees from the face of the lion, || And the bear has met him, || And he has come into the house, || And has leaned his hand on the wall, || And the serpent has bitten him. 
Is not the Day of YHWH darkness and not light, || Even thick darkness that has no brightness? 
“I have hated—I have loathed your festivals, || And I am not refreshed by your restraints. 
For though you cause burnt-offerings and your presents to ascend to Me, || I am not pleased, || And I do not behold the peace-offering of your fatlings. 
Turn the noise of your songs aside from Me, || Indeed, I do not hear the praise of your stringed instruments. 
And judgment rolls on as waters, || And righteousness as a perennial stream. 
Did you bring sacrifices and offerings near to Me, || In a wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 
And you bore Succoth your king, and Chiun your images, || The star of your god, that you made for yourselves. 
And I removed you beyond Damascus,” said YHWH—God of Hosts is His Name.
