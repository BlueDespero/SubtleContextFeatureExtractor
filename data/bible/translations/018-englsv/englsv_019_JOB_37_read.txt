Job.
Chapter 37.
“Also, my heart trembles at this, || And it moves from its place. 
Listen diligently to the trembling of His voice, || Indeed, the sound goes forth from His mouth. 
He directs it under the whole heavens, || And its light is over the skirts of the earth. 
A voice roars after it—He thunders with the voice of His excellence, || And He does not hold them back, || When His voice is heard. 
God thunders with His voice wonderfully, || Doing great things and we do not know. 
For He says to snow: Be on the earth. And the small rain and great rain of His power. 
Into the hand of every man he seals, || For the knowledge by all men of His work. 
And the beast enters into its lair, || And it continues in its habitations. 
From the inner chamber comes a windstorm, || And from scatterings winds—cold, 
From the breath of God is frost given, || And the breadth of waters is constricted, 
Indeed, by filling He presses out a cloud, and His light scatters a cloud. 
And it is turning itself around by His counsels, || For their doing all He commands them, || On the face of the habitable earth. 
Whether for a rod, or for His land, || Or for kindness—He causes it to come. 
Hear this, O Job, || Stand and consider the wonders of God. 
Do you know when God places them, || And caused the light of His cloud to shine? 
Do you know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge? 
How your garments are warm, || In the quieting of the earth from the south? 
You have made an expanse with Him || For the clouds—strong as a hard mirror! 
Let us know what we say to Him, || We do not set in array because of darkness. 
Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man has spoken, surely he is swallowed up. 
And now, they have not seen the light, || It is bright in the clouds, || And the wind has passed by and cleanses them. 
It comes from the golden north, || Fearful splendor is beside God. 
The Mighty! We have not found Him out, || High in power and judgment, || He does not answer! And abundant in righteousness, 
Therefore men fear Him, || He does not see any of the wise of heart.”
