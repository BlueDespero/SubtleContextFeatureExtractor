Zechariah.
Chapter 4.
And the messenger who is speaking with me turns back, and stirs me up as one who is stirred up out of his sleep, 
and he says to me, “What are you seeing?” And I say, “I have looked, and behold, a lampstand of gold—all of it, and its bowl is on its top, and its seven lamps are on it, and twice seven pipes are to the lights that are on its top, 
and two olive-trees are by it, one on the right of the bowl and one on its left.” 
And I answer and speak to the messenger who is speaking with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?” 
And the messenger who is speaking with me answers and says to me, “Have you not known what these are?” And I say, “No, my lord.” 
And he answers and speaks to me, saying, “This is a word of YHWH to Zerubbabel, saying, || Not by a force, nor by power, || But—by My Spirit, said YHWH of Hosts. 
Who are you, O great mountain || Before Zerubbabel—for a plain! And he has brought forth the top-stone, || Cries of Grace, grace—are to it.” 
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Hands of Zerubbabel founded this house, || And his hands finish it, || And you have known that YHWH of Hosts || Has sent Me to you. 
For who trampled on the day of small things, || They have rejoiced, || And seen the tin weight in the hand of Zerubbabel, || These seven are the eyes of YHWH, || They are going to and fro in all the land.” 
And I answer and say to him, “What are these two olive-trees, on the right of the lampstand, and on its left?” 
And I answer a second time, and say to him, “What are the two branches of the olive trees that, by means of the two golden pipes, are emptying out of themselves the oil?” 
And he speaks to me, saying, “Have you not known what these are?” And I say, “No, my lord.” 
And he says, “These are the two sons of the oil, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.”
