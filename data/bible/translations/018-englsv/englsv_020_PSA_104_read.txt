Psalms.
Chapter 104.
Bless, O my soul, YHWH! YHWH, my God, || You have been very great, || You have put on splendor and majesty. 
Covering Himself with light as a garment, || Stretching out the heavens as a curtain, 
Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, || Who is making thick clouds His chariot, || Who is walking on wings of wind, 
Making His messengers—the winds, || His ministers—the flaming fire. 
He has founded earth on its bases, || It is not moved for all time and forever. 
The abyss! You have covered it as with clothing, || Waters stand above hills. 
They flee from Your rebuke, || They hurry away from the voice of Your thunder. 
They go up hills—they go down valleys, || To a place You have founded for them. 
You have set a border, they do not pass over, || They do not turn back to cover the earth. 
He is sending forth fountains in valleys, || They go on between hills. 
They water every beast of the field, || Wild donkeys break their thirst. 
The bird of the heavens dwells by them, || From between the branches || They give forth the voice. 
Watering hills from His upper chambers, || The earth is satisfied from the fruit of Your works. 
Causing grass to spring up for livestock, || And herb for the service of man, || To bring forth bread from the earth, 
And wine—it makes the heart of man glad, || To cause the face to shine from oil, || And bread—it supports the heart of man. 
The trees of YHWH are satisfied, || Cedars of Lebanon that He has planted, 
Where birds make nests, || The stork—the firs are her house. 
The high hills are for wild goats, rocks are a refuge for hyraxes, 
He made the moon for seasons, || The sun has known his place of entrance. 
You set darkness, and it is night, || Every beast of the forest creeps in it. 
The young lions are roaring for prey, || And to seek their food from God. 
The sun rises, they are gathered, || And they crouch in their dens. 
Man goes forth to his work, || And to his service—until evening. 
How many have been Your works, O YHWH, || You have made all of them in wisdom, || The earth is full of your possessions. 
This, the sea, great and broad of sides, || There are moving things—innumerable, || Living creatures—small with great. 
There ships go—and leviathan, || That You have formed to play in it. 
All of them look to You, || To give their food in its season. 
You give to them—they gather, || You open Your hand—they are satisfied with good. 
You hide Your face—they are troubled, || You gather their spirit—they expire, || And they return to their dust. 
You send out Your Spirit, they are created, || And You renew the face of the ground. 
The glory of YHWH is for all time, || YHWH rejoices in His works, 
Who is looking to earth, and it trembles, || He comes against hills, and they smoke. 
I sing to YHWH during my life, || I sing praise to my God while I exist. 
My meditation on Him is sweet, || I rejoice in YHWH. 
Sinners are consumed from the earth, || And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, YHWH. Praise YAH!
