Proverbs.
Chapter 29.
A man often reproved, hardening the neck, || Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing. 
In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, || And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh. 
A man loving wisdom makes his father glad, || And a friend of harlots destroys wealth. 
A king establishes a land by judgment, || And one receiving gifts throws it down. 
A man taking a portion above his neighbor, || Spreads a net for his own steps. 
A snare is in the transgression of the evil, || And the righteous sing and rejoice. 
The righteous knows the plea of the poor, || The wicked does not understand knowledge. 
Men of scorning ensnare a city, || And the wise turn back anger. 
A wise man is judged by the foolish man, || And he has been angry, || And he has laughed, and there is no rest. 
Men of blood hate the perfect, || And the upright seek his soul. 
A fool brings out all his mind, || And the wise restrains it until afterward. 
A ruler who is attending to lying words, || All his ministers are wicked. 
The poor and the man of frauds have met together, || YHWH is enlightening the eyes of them both. 
A king that is judging the poor with truth, || His throne is established forever. 
A rod and reproof give wisdom, || And a youth let away is shaming his mother. 
In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplies, || And the righteous look on their fall. 
Discipline your son, and he gives you comfort, || Indeed, he gives delights to your soul. 
A people is made naked without a vision, || And whoever is keeping the Law, O his blessedness! 
By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, || And there is nothing answering. 
You have seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him. 
Whoever is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, || At his latter end he is also continuator. 
An angry man stirs up contention, || And a furious man is multiplying transgression. 
The pride of man humbles him, || And humility of spirit upholds honor. 
Whoever is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, || He hears execration, and does not tell. 
Fear of man causes a snare, || And the confident in YHWH is set on high. 
Many are seeking the face of a ruler, || And the judgment of each is from YHWH. 
The perverse man is an abomination to the righteous, || And the upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked!
