Psalms.
Chapter 26.
BY DAVID. Judge me, O YHWH, for I have walked in my integrity, || And I have trusted in YHWH, || I do not slide. 
Try me, O YHWH, and prove me, || My reins and my heart are purified, 
For Your kindness is before my eyes, || And I have habitually walked in Your truth. 
I have not sat with vain men, || And I do not enter with pretenders. 
I have hated the assembly of evildoers, || And I do not sit with the wicked. 
I wash my hands in innocence, || And I go around Your altar, O YHWH. 
To sound with a voice of confession, || And to recount all Your wonders. 
YHWH, I have loved the habitation of Your house, || And the place of the Dwelling Place of Your glory. 
Do not gather my soul with sinners, || And my life with men of blood, 
In whose hand is a wicked scheme, || And their right hand is full of bribes. 
And I walk in my integrity, || Redeem me, and favor me. 
My foot has stood in uprightness, || In assemblies I bless YHWH!
