Job.
Chapter 26.
And Job answers and says: 
“How you have helped the powerless, || Saved an arm not strong! 
How you have given counsel to the unwise, || And made known wise plans in abundance. 
With whom have you declared words? And whose breath came forth from you? 
The Rephaim are formed, || Also their inhabitants beneath the waters. 
Sheol is naked before Him, || And there is no covering to destruction. 
Stretching out the north over desolation, || Hanging the earth on nothing, 
Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, || And the cloud is not burst under them. 
Taking hold of the face of the throne, || Spreading His cloud over it. 
He has placed a limit on the waters, || To the boundary of light with darkness. 
Pillars of the heavens tremble, || And they wonder because of His rebuke. 
By His power He has quieted the sea, || And by His understanding struck the proud. 
He beautified the heavens by His Spirit, || His hand has formed the fleeing serpent. 
Behold, these are the borders of His way, and how little a matter is heard of Him, and who understands the thunder of His might?”
