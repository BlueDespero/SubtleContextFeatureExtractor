Micah.
Chapter 6.
Now hear that which YHWH is saying: “Rise—strive with the mountains, || And cause the hills to hear your voice. 
Hear, O mountains, the strife of YHWH, || You strong ones—foundations of earth! For a strife is to YHWH, with His people, || And with Israel He reasons. 
O My people, what have I done to you? And how have I wearied you? Testify against Me. 
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, || And I have ransomed you from the house of servants, || And I send Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you. 
O My people, please remember || What Balak king of Moab counseled, || What Balaam son of Beor answered him || (From Shittim to Gilgal), || In order to know the righteous acts of YHWH.” 
With what do I come before YHWH? Do I bow to God Most High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves—sons of a year? 
Is YHWH pleased with thousands of rams? With myriads of streams of oil? Do I give my firstborn for my transgression? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
He has declared to you, O man, what is good; Indeed, what is YHWH requiring of you, || Except—to do judgment, and love kindness, || And to walk lowly with your God? 
A voice of YHWH calls to the city, || And wisdom fears Your Name, || “Hear the rod, and Him who appointed it. 
Are there yet in the house of the wicked || Treasures of wickedness, || And the abhorred meager ephah? 
Do I reckon it pure with balances of wickedness? And with a bag of deceitful stones? 
Whose rich ones have been full of violence, || And its inhabitants have spoken falsehood, || And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 
And I also, I have begun to strike you, || To make desolate, because of your sins. 
You eat, and you are not satisfied, || And your pit is in your midst, || And you remove, and do not deliver, || And that which you deliver, I give to a sword. 
You sow, and you do not reap, || You tread the olive, || And you do not pour out oil, || And new wine—and you do not drink wine. 
And the statutes of Omri are kept habitually, || And all the work of the house of Ahab, || And you walk in their counsels, || For My giving you for a desolation, || And its inhabitants for a hissing, || And you bear the reproach of My people!”
