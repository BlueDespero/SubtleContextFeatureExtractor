Hosea.
Chapter 5.
“Hear this, O priests, and attend, O house of Israel, || And, O house of the king, give ear, || For the judgment is for you, || For you have been a snare on Mizpah, || And a net spread out on Tabor. 
And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, || And I am a chain to them all. 
I have known Ephraim, || And Israel has not been hid from Me, || For now you have gone whoring, Ephraim, || Israel is defiled. 
They do not give up their habitual doings, || To turn back to their God, || For a spirit of whoredoms is in their midst, || And YHWH they have not known. 
And humbled has been the excellence of Israel to his face, || And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, || Judah has also stumbled with them. 
With their flock and with their herd, || They go to seek YHWH, and do not find, || He has withdrawn from them. 
Against YHWH they dealt treacherously, || For they have begotten strange sons, || Now a month consumes them with their portions. 
Blow a horn in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, || Shout, O Beth-Aven, after you, O Benjamin. 
Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, || I have made known a sure thing among the tribes of Israel. 
Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, || I pour out My wrath as water on them. 
Ephraim is oppressed, broken in judgment, || When he pleased he went after the command. 
And I am as a moth to Ephraim, || And as a rotten thing to the house of Judah. 
And Ephraim sees his sickness, and Judah his wound, || And Ephraim goes to Asshur, || And sends to a warlike king, || And he is not able to give healing to you, || Nor does he remove a scar from you. 
For I am as a lion to Ephraim, || And as a young lion to the house of Judah, I tear and go, || I carry away, and there is no deliverer. 
I go—I return to My place, || Until they are desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they seek Me speedily!”
