Psalms.
Chapter 89.
AN INSTRUCTION OF ETHAN THE EZRAHITE. Of the kind acts of YHWH, I sing for all time, || From generation to generation I make known Your faithfulness with my mouth, 
For I said, “Kindness is built for all time, || The heavens! You establish Your faithfulness in them.” 
I have made a covenant for My chosen, || I have sworn to My servant David: 
“Even for all time I establish your seed, || And have built your throne to generation and generation.” Selah. 
And the heavens confess Your wonders, O YHWH, || Your faithfulness is also in an assembly of holy ones. 
For who in the sky, compares himself to YHWH? Who is like to YHWH among sons of the mighty? 
God is very terrible, || In the secret counsel of His holy ones, || And fearful over all surrounding Him. 
O YHWH, God of Hosts, || Who is like You—a strong YAH? And Your faithfulness is around You. 
You are ruler over the pride of the sea, || In the lifting up of its billows You restrain them. 
You have bruised Rahab, as one wounded. You have scattered Your enemies with the arm of Your strength. 
The heavens are Yours, || The earth is also Yours, || The habitable world and its fullness, || You have founded them. 
North and south You have appointed them, || Tabor and Hermon sing in Your Name. 
You have an arm with might, || Strong is Your hand—high Your right hand. 
Righteousness and judgment || Are the fixed place of Your throne, || Kindness and truth go before Your face. 
O the blessedness of the people knowing the shout, || O YHWH, they habitually walk in the light of Your face. 
They rejoice in Your Name all the day, || And they are exalted in Your righteousness, 
For You are the beauty of their strength, || And in Your good will is our horn exalted, 
For our shield is of YHWH, || And our king to the Holy One of Israel. 
Then You have spoken in vision, || To Your saint, indeed, || You say, I have placed help on a mighty one, || Exalted a chosen one out of the people, 
I have found My servant David, || With My holy oil I have anointed him. 
With whom My hand is established, || My arm also strengthens him. 
An enemy does not exact on him, || And a son of perverseness does not afflict him. 
And I have beaten down his adversaries before him, || And I plague those hating him, 
And My faithfulness and kindness are with him, || And in My Name is his horn exalted. 
And I have set his hand on the sea, || And his right hand on the rivers. 
He proclaims to Me: “You are my Father, || My God, and the rock of my salvation.” 
I also appoint him firstborn, || Highest of the kings of the earth. 
For all time I keep for him My kindness, || And My covenant is steadfast with him. 
And I have set his seed forever, || And his throne as the days of the heavens. 
If his sons forsake My law, || And do not walk in My judgments; 
If they defile My statutes, || And do not keep My commands, 
I have looked after their transgression with a rod, || And their iniquity with strokes, 
And I do not break My kindness from him, || Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness. 
I do not profane My covenant, || And I do not change that which is going forth from My lips. 
Once I have sworn by My holiness, || I do not lie to David, 
His seed is for all time, || And his throne is as the sun before Me, 
It is established as the moon for all time, || And the witness in the sky is steadfast. Selah. 
And You, You have cast off, and reject, || You have shown Yourself angry with Your anointed, 
Have rejected the covenant of Your servant, || You have defiled his crown to the earth, 
You have broken down all his hedges, || You have made his fortifications a ruin. 
Everyone passing by the way has spoiled him, || He has been a reproach to his neighbors, 
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries, || You have caused all his enemies to rejoice. 
Also—You turn back the sharpness of his sword, || And have not established him in battle, 
Have caused him to cease from his brightness, || And have cast down his throne to the earth. 
You have shortened the days of his youth, || Have covered him over with shame. Selah. 
Until when, O YHWH, are You hidden? Does Your fury burn as fire forever? 
Remember how short my lifetime is. Why have You created in vain || All the sons of men? 
Who is the man that lives, and does not see death? He delivers his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah. 
Where are Your former kindnesses, O Lord, || Which You have sworn to David in Your faithfulness? 
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, || I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples, 
With which Your enemies reproached, O YHWH, || With which they have reproached || The steps of Your anointed. 
Blessed is YHWH for all time. Amen and amen!
