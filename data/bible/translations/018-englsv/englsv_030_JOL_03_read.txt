Joel.
Chapter 3.
“For behold, in those days, and in that time, || When I turn back to the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
Then I have gathered all the nations, || And caused them to go down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, || And I have been in judgment with them there, || Concerning My people and My inheritance—Israel, || Whom they scattered among nations, || And My land they have apportioned. 
And for My people they cast a lot, || And they give the young man for a harlot, || And have sold the young woman for wine, || That they may drink. 
And also, what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon, || And all circuits of Philistia? Are you rendering repayment to Me? And if you are giving repayment to Me, || Swiftly, quickly, I return your repayment on your head. 
In that My silver and My gold you took, || And My desirable things that are good, || You have brought into your temples. 
And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, || You have sold to the sons of Javan, || To put them far off from their border. 
Behold, I am stirring them up out of the place || To where you have sold them, || And I have turned back your repayment on your head, 
And have sold your sons and your daughters || Into the hand of the sons of Judah, || And they have sold them to Sabeans, || To a nation far off, for YHWH has spoken.” 
Proclaim this among nations, || Sanctify a war, stir up the mighty ones, || Come near, come up, let all the men of war. 
Beat your plowshares to swords, || And your pruning-hooks to javelins, || Let the weak say, “I am mighty.” 
Hurry, and come in, all you nations around, || And be gathered together, || There cause to come down, O YHWH, || Your mighty ones. 
“Let the nations wake and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, || For there I sit to judge all the nations around. 
Send forth a sickle, || For harvest has ripened, || Come in, come down, for the press has been filled, || Winepresses have overflowed, || For great is their wickedness.” 
Multitudes, multitudes are in the Valley of Decision, || For near is the Day of YHWH in the Valley of Decision. 
Sun and moon have been black, || And stars have gathered up their shining. 
And YHWH roars from Zion, || And gives forth His voice from Jerusalem, || And the heavens and earth have shaken, || And YHWH is a refuge to His people, || And a stronghold to sons of Israel. 
“And you have known that I am your God YHWH, || Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain, || And Jerusalem has been holy, || And strangers do not pass over into it again.” 
And it has come to pass in that day, || The mountains drop down juice, || And the hills flow with milk, || And all streams of Judah go with water, || And a fountain from the house of YHWH goes forth, || And has watered the Valley of Shittim. 
“Egypt becomes a desolation, || And Edom becomes a desolation, a wilderness, || For violence to sons of Judah, || Whose innocent blood they shed in their land. 
And Judah dwells for all time, || And Jerusalem to generation and generation. 
And I have declared their blood innocent, || That I did not declare innocent, || And YHWH is dwelling in Zion!”
