2 Corinthians.
Chapter 9.
For indeed, concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you, 
for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared a year ago, and your zeal stirred up the greater part, 
and I sent the brothers, that our boasting on your behalf may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I said, you may be ready, 
lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we may be put to shame (that we do not say—you) in this same confidence of boasting. 
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they may go before to you, and may make up before your formerly announced blessing, that this be ready, as a blessing, and not as covetousness. 
And remember this: he who is sowing sparingly, will also reap sparingly; and he who is sowing in blessings, will also reap in blessings; 
each one, according as he purposes in heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver, 
and God is able to cause all grace to abound to you, that in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound to every good work, 
according as it has been written: “He dispersed abroad, He gave to the poor, His righteousness remains throughout the age,” 
and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness, 
being enriched to all liberality in everything, which works thanksgiving through us to God, 
because the ministry of this service not only is supplying the wants of the holy ones, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God, 
through the proof of this ministry glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ, and for the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all, 
and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you because of the exceeding grace of God on you; 
thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!
