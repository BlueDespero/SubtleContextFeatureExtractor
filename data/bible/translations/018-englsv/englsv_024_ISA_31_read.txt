Isaiah.
Chapter 31.
Woe to those going down to Egypt for help, || And who lean on horses, || And trust on chariots, because they are many, || And on horsemen, because they are very strong, || And have not looked on the Holy One of Israel, || And have not sought YHWH. 
And He is also wise, and brings in evil, || And He has not turned aside His words, || And He has risen against a house of evildoers, || And against the help of workers of iniquity. 
And the Egyptians are men, and not God, || And their horses are flesh, and not spirit, || And YHWH stretches out His hand, || And the helper has stumbled, || And the helped one has fallen, || And together all of them are consumed. 
For thus said YHWH to me: “As the lion and the young lion growl over his prey, || Against whom a multitude of shepherds is called, || He is not frightened from their voice, || And he is not humbled from their noise; So YHWH of Hosts comes down || To war on Mount Zion, and on her height. 
As birds flying, so does YHWH of Hosts || Cover over Jerusalem, covering and delivering, || Passing over, and causing to escape.” 
Turn back to Him from whom sons of Israel || Have deepened apostasy. 
For in that day each despises His idols of silver, and his idols of gold, || That your hands made to you—a sin. 
And Asshur has fallen by sword, not of the high, || Indeed, a sword—not of the low, consumes him, || And he has fled for himself from the face of a sword, || And his young men become tributary. 
And he passes on to his rock from fear, || And his princes have been frightened by the ensign—a declaration of YHWH, || Who has a light in Zion, || And who has a furnace in Jerusalem!
