Proverbs.
Chapter 21.
The heart of a king is streams of waters in the hand of YHWH, || He inclines it wherever He pleases. 
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, || And YHWH is pondering hearts. 
To do righteousness and judgment, || Is chosen of YHWH rather than sacrifice. 
Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, || Tillage of the wicked is sin. 
The purposes of the diligent are only to advantage, || And of every hasty one, only to want. 
The making of treasures by a lying tongue, || Is a vanity driven away of those seeking death. 
The spoil of the wicked catches them, || Because they have refused to do judgment. 
The way of a man who is vile is contrary, || And the pure—his work is upright. 
Better to sit on a corner of the roof, || Than with a woman of contentions and a house of company. 
The soul of the wicked has desired evil, his neighbor is not gracious in his eyes. 
When the scorner is punished, the simple becomes wise, || And in giving understanding to the wise He receives knowledge. 
The Righteous One is acting wisely || Toward the house of the wicked, || He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness. 
Whoever is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, || He also cries, and is not answered. 
A gift in secret pacifies anger, || And a bribe in the bosom—strong fury. 
To do justice is joy to the righteous, || But ruin to workers of iniquity. 
A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, || Rests in an assembly of Rephaim. 
Whoever is loving mirth is a poor man, || Whoever is loving wine and oil makes no wealth. 
The wicked is an atonement for the righteous, || And the treacherous dealer for the upright. 
Better to dwell in a wilderness land, || Than with a woman of contentions and anger. 
A treasure to be desired, and oil, || Is in the habitation of the wise, || And a foolish man swallows it up. 
Whoever is pursuing righteousness and kindness, || Finds life, righteousness, and honor. 
The wise has gone up a city of the mighty, || And brings down the strength of its confidence. 
Whoever is keeping his mouth and his tongue, || Is keeping his soul from adversities. 
Proud, haughty, scorner—his name, || Who is working in the wrath of pride. 
The desire of the slothful slays him, || For his hands have refused to work. 
All the day desiring he has desired, || And the righteous gives and does not withhold. 
The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination, || Much more when he brings it in wickedness. 
A false witness perishes, || And an attentive man speaks forever. 
A wicked man has hardened by his face, || And the upright—he prepares his way. 
There is no wisdom, nor understanding, || Nor counsel against YHWH. 
A horse is prepared for a day of battle, || And the deliverance is of YHWH!
