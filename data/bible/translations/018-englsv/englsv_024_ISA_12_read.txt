Isaiah.
Chapter 12.
And you have said in that day: “I thank you, O YHWH, || Though You have been angry with me, || Your anger turns back, || And You comfort me. 
Behold, God is my salvation, I trust, and do not fear, || For my strength and song is YAH—YHWH, || And He is to me for salvation. 
And you have drawn waters with joy || Out of the fountains of salvation, 
And you have said in that day, || Give praise to YHWH, call on His Name. Make His acts known among the peoples. Make mention that His Name is set on high. 
Praise YHWH, for He has done excellence, || This is known in all the earth. 
Cry aloud, and sing, O inhabitant of Zion, || For the Holy One of Israel is great in your midst!”
