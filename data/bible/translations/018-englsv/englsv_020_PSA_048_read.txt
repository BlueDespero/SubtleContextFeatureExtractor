Psalms.
Chapter 48.
A SONG. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. Great is YHWH, and greatly praised, || In the city of our God—His holy hill. 
Beautiful for elevation, || A joy of all the land, is Mount Zion, || The sides of the north, the city of the great King. 
God is known for a tower in her high places. 
For behold, the kings met, they passed by together, 
They have seen—so they have marveled, || They have been troubled, they were hurried away. 
Trembling has seized them there, || Pain, as of a travailing woman. 
By an east wind You shatter ships of Tarshish. 
As we have heard, so we have seen, || In the city of YHWH of hosts, || In the city of our God, God establishes her for all time. Selah. 
We have thought, O God, of Your kindness, || In the midst of Your temple, 
As is Your Name, O God, so is Your praise, || Over the ends of the earth, || Righteousness has filled Your right hand. 
Mount Zion rejoices, || The daughters of Judah are joyful, || For the sake of Your judgments. 
Surround Zion, and go around her, count her towers, 
Set your heart to her bulwark, || Consider her high places, || So that you recount to a later generation, 
That this God is our God—For all time and forever, || He leads us over death!
