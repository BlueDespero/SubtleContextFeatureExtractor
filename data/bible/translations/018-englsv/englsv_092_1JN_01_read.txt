The First Letter of John.
Chapter 1.
That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of Life— 
and the Life appeared, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the continuous Life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us— 
we declare to you that which we have seen and heard, that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ; 
and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full. 
And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness is not in Him at all; 
if we may say, “We have fellowship with Him,” and may walk in the darkness—we lie, and do not speak the truth; 
and if we may walk in the light, as He is in the light—we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanses us from every sin; 
if we may say, “We have no sin,” we lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us; 
if we may confess our sins, He is steadfast and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness; 
if we may say, “We have not sinned,” we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
