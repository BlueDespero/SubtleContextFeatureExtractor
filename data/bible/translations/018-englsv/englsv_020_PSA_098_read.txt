Psalms.
Chapter 98.
A PSALM. Sing to YHWH a new song, || For He has done wonders, || His right hand and His holy arm have given salvation to Him. 
YHWH has made His salvation known, || Before the eyes of the nations, || He has revealed His righteousness, 
He has remembered His kindness, || And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, || All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
Shout to YHWH, all the earth, || Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing. 
Sing to YHWH with harp, || With harp, and voice of praise, 
With trumpets, and voice of a horn, shout before the King, YHWH. 
The sea and its fullness roar, || The world and the inhabitants in it. 
Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud, 
Before YHWH, || For He has come to judge the earth, || He judges the world in righteousness, || And the people in uprightness!
