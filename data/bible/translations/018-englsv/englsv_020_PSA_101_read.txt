Psalms.
Chapter 101.
A PSALM OF DAVID. I sing kindness and judgment, || To You, O YHWH, I sing praise. 
I act wisely in a perfect way, || When do You come to me? I habitually walk in the integrity of my heart, || In the midst of my house. 
I do not set a worthless thing before my eyes, || I have hated the work of those turning aside, || It does not adhere to me. 
A perverse heart turns aside from me, || I do not know wickedness. 
Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, || Him I cut off, || The high of eyes and proud of heart, || Him I do not endure. 
My eyes are on the faithful of the land, || To dwell with me, || Whoever is walking in a perfect way, he serves me. 
He who is working deceit does not dwell in my house, || Whoever is speaking lies is not established before my eyes. 
At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, || To cut off from the city of YHWH || All the workers of iniquity!
