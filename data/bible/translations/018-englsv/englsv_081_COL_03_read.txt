Colossians.
Chapter 3.
If, then, you were raised with the Christ, seek the things above, where the Christ is, seated on the right hand of God; 
mind the things above, not the things on the earth, 
for you died, and your life has been hid with the Christ in God; 
when the Christ—our life—may have appeared, then we will also appear with Him in glory. 
Put to death, then, your members that are on the earth—whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry— 
because of which things comes the anger of God on the sons of the disobedience, 
in which you also—you once walked, when you lived in them; 
but now put off, even you, the whole—anger, wrath, malice, slander, filthy talking—out of your mouth. 
Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his practices, 
and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who created him, 
where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman, but Christ is all and in all. 
Put on, therefore, as chosen ones of God, holy and beloved, yearnings of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness, long-suffering, 
bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if anyone may have a quarrel with anyone, as the Christ also forgave you—so also you; 
and above all these things, have love, which is a bond of the perfection, 
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you were also called in one body, and become thankful. 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the LORD; 
and all, whatever you may do in word or in work, do all things in the Name of the Lord Jesus—giving thanks to the God and Father, through Him. 
The wives: be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the LORD; 
the husbands: love your wives, and do not be bitter with them; 
the children: obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the LORD; 
the fathers: do not distress your children, lest they be discouraged; 
the servants: obey those who are masters in all things according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God; 
and all, whatever you may do—out of soul work—as to the LORD, and not to men, 
having known that you will receive the repayment of the inheritance from the LORD—for you serve the LORD Christ; 
and he who is doing unrighteously will receive what he did unrighteously, and there is no favor by appearance.
