Proverbs.
Chapter 27.
Do not boast about tomorrow, || For you do not know what a day brings forth. 
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth, || A stranger, and not your own lips. 
A stone is heavy, and the sand is heavy, || And the anger of a fool || Is heavier than them both. 
Fury is fierce, and anger is overflowing, || And who stands before jealousy? 
Better is open reproof than hidden love. 
The wounds of a lover are faithful, || And the kisses of an enemy are abundant. 
A satiated soul treads down a honeycomb, || And every bitter thing is sweet to a hungry soul. 
As a bird wandering from her nest, || So is a man wandering from his place. 
Perfume and incense make the heart glad, || And the sweetness of one’s friend—from counsel of the soul. 
Do not forsake your own friend and the friend of your father, || And do not enter the house of your brother in a day of your calamity, || A near neighbor is better than a brother far off. 
Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, || And I return a word to my reproacher. 
The prudent has seen the evil, he is hidden, || The simple have passed on, they are punished. 
Take his garment when a stranger has been guarantor, || And pledge it for a strange woman. 
Whoever is greeting his friend with a loud voice, || Rising early in the morning, || It is reckoned a light thing to him. 
A continual dropping in a day of rain, || And a woman of contentions are alike, 
Whoever is hiding her has hidden the wind, || And the ointment of his right hand calls out. 
Iron is sharpened by iron, || And a man sharpens the face of his friend. 
The keeper of a fig tree eats its fruit, || And the preserver of his master is honored. 
As in water the face is to face, || So the heart of man to man. 
Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, || And the eyes of man are not satisfied. 
A refining pot is for silver, and a furnace for gold, || And a man according to his praise. 
If you beat the foolish in a mortar, || Among washed things—with a pestle, || His folly does not turn aside from off him. 
Know the face of your flock well, || Set your heart to the droves, 
For riches are not for all time, || Nor a crown to generation and generation. 
The hay was revealed, and the tender grass seen, || And the herbs of mountains gathered. 
Lambs are for your clothing, || And the price of the field are male goats, 
And a sufficiency of goats’ milk is for your bread, || For bread to your house, and life to your girls!
