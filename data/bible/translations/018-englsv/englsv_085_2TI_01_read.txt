The Second Letter of Paul to Timothy.
Chapter 1.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 
to Timotheus, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord! 
I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a pure conscience, that I unceasingly have remembrance concerning you in my supplications night and day, 
desiring to see you greatly, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy, 
taking remembrance of the unhypocritical faith that is in you, that first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in you. 
For which cause I remind you to stir up the gift of God that is in you through the putting on of my hands, 
for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind; 
therefore you may not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but you suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God, 
who saved us, and called with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages, 
and was made visible now through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who indeed abolished death, and enlightened life and immortality through the good news, 
to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations, 
for which cause these things I also suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that He is able to guard that which I have committed to Him—to that day. 
Hold the pattern of sound words, which you heard from me, in faith and love that is in Christ Jesus; 
guard the good thing committed through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us; 
you have known this, that they turned from me—all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes; 
may the LORD give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because he refreshed me many times, and was not ashamed of my chain, 
but being in Rome, he sought me very diligently and found me; 
may the LORD give to him to find kindness from the LORD in that day; and you very well know how much he ministered in Ephesus.
