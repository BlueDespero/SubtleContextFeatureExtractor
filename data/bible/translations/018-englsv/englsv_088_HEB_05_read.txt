Hebrews.
Chapter 5.
For every chief priest taken out of men is set in things pertaining to God in behalf of men, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, 
being able to be gentle to those being ignorant and going astray, since he is also surrounded with weakness; 
and because of this weakness he ought, just as for the people, so also for himself, to bring forward sacrifices for sins; 
and no one takes the honor to himself, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron. 
So also the Christ did not glorify Himself to become Chief Priest, but He who spoke to Him: “You are My Son, today I have begotten You”; 
just as He also says in another place, “You are a priest throughout the age, according to the order of Melchizedek”; 
who in the days of His flesh having offered up both prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and having been heard in respect to that which He feared, 
though being a Son, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered, 
and having been made perfect, He became the cause of continuous salvation to all those obeying Him, 
having been called by God a Chief Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, 
concerning the Word, of whom we have much to speak, and of hard explanation to say, since you have become dull of hearing, 
for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again you have need that one teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and you have become having need of milk, and not of strong food, 
for everyone who is partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness—for he is an infant, 
and the strong food is of perfect men, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, to both the discernment of good and of evil.
