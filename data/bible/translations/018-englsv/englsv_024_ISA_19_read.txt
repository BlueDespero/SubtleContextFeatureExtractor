Isaiah.
Chapter 19.
The burden of Egypt. Behold, YHWH is riding on a swift thick cloud, || And He has entered Egypt, || And the idols of Egypt have been moved at His presence, || And the heart of Egypt melts in its midst. 
And I armed Egyptians against Egyptians, || And they fought, each against his brother, || And each against his neighbor, || City against city, kingdom against kingdom. 
And the spirit of Egypt has been emptied out in its midst. And I swallow up its counsel, || And they have sought to the idols, || And to the charmers, || And to those having familiar spirits, || And to the wizards. 
And I have delivered the Egyptians || Into the hand of a hard lord, || And a strong king rules over them, || A declaration of the Lord, YHWH of Hosts. 
And waters have failed from the sea, || And a river is desolated and dried up. 
And they have turned away the flowings, || Brooks of the bulwark have been weak and dried up, || Reed and flag have withered. 
Exposed things by the brook, by the edge of the brook, || And every sown thing of the brook, has withered, || It has been driven away, and is not. 
And the fishers have lamented, || And all casting a hook into the brook have mourned, || And those spreading dragnets on the face of the waters have languished. 
And makers of fine flax have been ashamed, || And weavers of networks. 
And its foundations have been struck, || All making wages are afflicted in soul. 
Only, the princes of Zoan are fools, || The counsel of the wise ones of the counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am a son of the wise, a son of kings of antiquity?” 
Where are they now, your wise ones? Indeed, let them now tell it to you, || And they know what YHWH of Hosts has counseled against Egypt! 
Princes of Zoan have been foolish, || Princes of Noph have been lifted up, || And they have caused Egypt to err, || The chief of her tribes. 
YHWH has mingled in her midst || A spirit of perverseness, || And they have caused Egypt to err in all its work, || As a drunkard errs in his vomit. 
And there is no work to Egypt, || That head or tail, branch or reed, may do. 
In that day Egypt is like women, || And it has mourned, and been afraid, || Because of the waving of the hand of YHWH of Hosts, || That He is waving over it. 
And the land of Judah has been to Egypt for a cause of staggering, || Everyone who mentions it, fears for himself, || Because of the counsel of YHWH of Hosts, || That He is counseling against it. 
In that day there are five cities in the land of Egypt, || Speaking the lip of Canaan, || And swearing to YHWH of Hosts, || “The city of destruction,” is said of one. 
In that day there is an altar to YHWH || In the midst of the land of Egypt, || And a standing pillar to YHWH near its border, 
And it has been for a sign and for a testimony, || To YHWH of Hosts in the land of Egypt, || For they cry to YHWH from the face of oppressors, || And He sends a Savior to them, || Even a great one, and has delivered them. 
And YHWH has been known to Egypt, || And the Egyptians have known YHWH in that day, || And done sacrifice and present, || And vowed a vow to YHWH, and completed it. 
And YHWH has struck Egypt, striking and healing, || And they have turned back to YHWH, || And He has accepted their plea, || And has healed them. 
In that day a highway is out of Egypt to Asshur, || And the Assyrians have come into Egypt, || And the Egyptians into Asshur, || And the Egyptians have served with the Assyrians. 
In that day Israel is third, || With Egypt, and with Asshur, || A blessing in the heart of the earth. 
In that YHWH of Hosts blessed it, saying, “Blessed is My people—Egypt, || And the work of My hands—Asshur, || And My inheritance—Israel!”
