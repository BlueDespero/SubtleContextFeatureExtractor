Psalms.
Chapter 100.
A PSALM OF THANKSGIVING. Shout to YHWH, all the earth! 
Serve YHWH with joy, come before Him with singing. 
Know that YHWH is God, || He made us, and we are His, || His people—and the flock of His pasture. 
Enter His gates with thanksgiving, || His courts with praise, || Give thanks to Him, bless His Name. 
For YHWH is good, || His kindness is for all time, || And His faithfulness to generation and generation!
