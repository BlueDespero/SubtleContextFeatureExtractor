Psalms.
Chapter 137.
By rivers of Babylon—There we sat, || Indeed, we wept when we remembered Zion. 
We hung our harps on willows in its midst. 
For there our captors asked us the words of a song, || And our spoilers—joy: “Sing to us of a song of Zion.” 
How do we sing the song of YHWH, || On the land of a stranger? 
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, my right hand forgets! 
My tongue cleaves to my palate, || If I do not remember you, || If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy. 
Remember, YHWH, for the sons of Edom, || The day of Jerusalem, || Those saying, “Raze, raze to its foundation!” 
O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one, || O the blessedness of him who repays to you your deed, || That you have done to us. 
O the blessedness of him who seizes, and has dashed your sucklings on the rock!
