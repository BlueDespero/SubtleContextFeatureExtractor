Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Praise YAH! Praise, you servants of YHWH. Praise the Name of YHWH. 
The Name of YHWH is blessed, || From now on, and for all time. 
From the rising of the sun to its going in, || The Name of YHWH is praised. 
YHWH is high above all nations, || His glory is above the heavens. 
Who is as our God YHWH, || He is exalting Himself to sit? 
He is humbling Himself to look || On the heavens and on the earth. 
He is raising up the poor from the dust, || He exalts the needy from a dunghill. 
To cause them to sit with princes, || With the princes of His people. 
Causing the barren one of the house to sit, || A joyful mother of sons; praise YAH!
