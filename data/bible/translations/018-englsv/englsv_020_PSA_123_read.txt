Psalms.
Chapter 123.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. I have lifted up my eyes to You, || O dweller in the heavens. 
Behold, as eyes of menservants || Are to the hand of their masters, || As eyes of a maidservant || Are to the hand of her mistress, || So are our eyes to our God YHWH, || Until He favors us. 
Favor us, O YHWH, favor us, || For we have been greatly filled with contempt, 
Our soul has been greatly filled || With the scorning of the easy ones, || With the contempt of the arrogant!
