Hosea.
Chapter 11.
“Because Israel is a youth, and I love him, || Out of Egypt I have called for My Son. 
They have called to them correctly, || They have gone from before them, || They sacrifice to lords, || And make incense to carved images. 
And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, || Taking them by their arms, || And they have not known that I strengthened them. 
I draw them with cords of man, || With thick cords of love, || And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, || And I incline to him—I feed him. 
He does not return to the land of Egypt, || And Asshur—he is his king, || For they have refused to return. 
The sword has been grievous in his cities, || And it has ended his bars, and consumed—from their own counsels. 
And My people are hanging in suspense about My returning, || And to the Most High they call, || Together they do not exalt. 
How do I give you up, O Ephraim? Do I deliver you up, O Israel? How do I make you as Admah? Do I set you as Zeboim? My heart is turned in Me, || My sympathy has been kindled together. 
I do not do the fierceness of My anger, || I do not turn back to destroy Ephraim, || For I am God, and not a man—The Holy One in your midst, and I do not enter in enmity. 
They go after YHWH—He roars as a lion, || When He roars, then the sons from the west tremble. 
They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt, || And as a dove out of the land of Asshur, || And I have caused them to dwell in their own houses,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“Ephraim has surrounded Me with feigning, || And the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah is again ruling with God, || And is faithful with the Holy Ones!”
