Numbers.
Chapter 5.
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Command the sons of Israel, and they send out of the camp every leper, and everyone with discharging, and everyone defiled by a body; 
you send out from male even to female; you send them to the outside of the camp and they do not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.” 
And the sons of Israel do so, and they send them out to the outside of the camp; as YHWH has spoken to Moses so the sons of Israel have done. 
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel: Man or woman, when they do any of the sins of man, by committing a trespass against YHWH, and that person is guilty, 
and they have confessed their sin which they have done, then he has restored his guilt in its principal, and is adding its fifth to it, and has given it to him in reference to whom he has been guilty. 
And if the man has no redeemer to restore the guilt to, the guilt which is restored is to YHWH for the priest, apart from the ram of the atonements, whereby he makes atonement for him. 
And every raised-offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they bring near to the priest, becomes his; 
and any man’s hallowed things become his; that which any man gives to the priest becomes his.” 
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you have said to them: When any man’s wife turns aside, and has committed a trespass against him, 
and a man has lain with her with the seed from intercourse, and it has been hid from the eyes of her husband, and concealed, and she has been defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she has not been caught, 
and a spirit of jealousy has passed over him, and he has been jealous for his wife, and she has been defiled—or a spirit of jealousy has passed over him, and he has been jealous for his wife, and she has not been defiled— 
then the man has brought in his wife to the priest, and he has brought in her offering for her—a tenth of the ephah of barley meal; he does not pour oil on it, nor does he put frankincense on it, for it is a present of jealousy, a present of memorial, causing remembrance of iniquity. 
And the priest has brought her near, and has caused her to stand before YHWH, 
and the priest has taken holy water in an earthen vessel, and the priest takes of the dust which is on the floor of the Dwelling Place, and has put it into the water, 
and the priest has caused the woman to stand before YHWH, and has uncovered the woman’s head, and has given the present of the memorial into her hands (it is a present of jealousy), and the bitter waters which cause the curse are in the hand of the priest. 
And the priest has caused her to swear, and has said to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness under your husband, be free from these bitter waters which cause the curse; 
and you, if you have turned aside under your husband, and if you have been defiled, and a man commits his intercourse with you besides your husband— 
then the priest has caused the woman to swear with an oath of execration, and the priest has said to the woman—YHWH gives you for an execration and for a curse in the midst of your people, in YHWH’s giving your thigh to fall and your belly to swell, 
and these waters which cause the curse have gone into your bowels to cause the belly to swell and the thigh to fall; and the woman has said, Amen, Amen. 
And the priest has written these execrations in a scroll, and has blotted them out with the bitter waters, 
and has caused the woman to drink the bitter waters which cause the curse, and the waters which cause the curse have entered into her for bitter things. 
And the priest has taken the present of jealousy out of the hand of the woman, and has waved the present before YHWH, and has brought it near to the altar; 
and the priest has taken a handful of the present, its memorial, and has made incense on the altar, and afterward causes the woman to drink the water; 
indeed, he has caused her to drink the water, and it has come to pass, if she has been defiled and commits a trespass against her husband, that the waters which cause the curse have gone into her for bitter things, and her belly has swelled, and her thigh has fallen, and the woman has become an execration in the midst of her people. 
And if the woman has not been defiled, and is clean, then she has been acquitted, and has been sown with seed. 
This is the law of jealousies when a wife turns aside under her husband and has been defiled, 
or when a spirit of jealousy passes over a man and he has been jealous of his wife, then he has caused the woman to stand before YHWH, and the priest has done to her all this law, 
and the man has been acquitted from iniquity, and that woman bears her iniquity.”
