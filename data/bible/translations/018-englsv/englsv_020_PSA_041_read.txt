Psalms.
Chapter 41.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. O the blessedness of him || Who is acting wisely to the poor, || In a day of evil YHWH delivers him. 
YHWH preserves him and revives him, || He is blessed in the land, || And You do not give him into the will of his enemies. 
YHWH supports him on a bed of sickness, || You have turned his bed in his weakness. 
I said, “O YHWH, favor me, || Heal my soul, for I sinned against You,” 
My enemies say evil of me: When he dies—his name has perished! 
And if he came to see—he speaks vanity, || His heart gathers iniquity to itself, || He goes out—at the street he speaks. 
All hating me whisper together against me, || Against me they devise evil to me: 
A worthless thing is poured out on him, || And because he lay down he does not rise again. 
Even my ally, in whom I trusted, || One eating my bread, || Made the heel great against me, 
And You, YHWH, favor me, || And cause me to rise, || And I give repayment to them. 
By this I have known, || That You have delighted in me, || Because my enemy does not shout over me. 
As for me, in my integrity, || You have taken hold on me, || And cause me to stand before You for all time. 
Blessed is YHWH, God of Israel, || From age to age. Amen and Amen.
