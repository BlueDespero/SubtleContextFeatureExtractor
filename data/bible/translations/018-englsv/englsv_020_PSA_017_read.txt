Psalms.
Chapter 17.
A PRAYER OF DAVID. Hear, O YHWH, righteousness, attend my cry, || Give ear to my prayer, without lips of deceit. 
My judgment goes out from before You; Your eyes see uprightly. 
You have proved my heart, || You have inspected by night, || You have tried me, You find nothing; My thoughts do not pass over my mouth. 
As for doings of man, || Through a word of Your lips I have observed || The paths of a destroyer; 
To uphold my goings in Your paths, || My steps have not slipped. 
I called You, for You answer me, || O God, incline Your ear to me, hear my speech. 
Separate Your kindness wonderfully, O Savior of the confiding, || By Your right hand, from withstanders. 
Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Your wings, 
From the face of the wicked who spoiled me, || From my enemies in soul who go around against me. 
They have closed up their fat, || Their mouths have spoken with pride: 
“Our steps have now surrounded him”; They set their eyes to turn aside in the land. 
His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, || As a young lion dwelling in secret places. 
Arise, O YHWH, go before his face, || Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Your sword, 
From men, Your hand, O YHWH, || From men of the world, their portion is in life, || And with Your hidden things You fill their belly, || They are satisfied with sons, || And have left their abundance to their sucklings. 
I—in righteousness, || I see Your face; I am satisfied, in awaking, with Your form!
