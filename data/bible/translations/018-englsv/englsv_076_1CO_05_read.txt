1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations—as that one has the wife of the father! 
And you are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work, 
for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so worked this thing: 
in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ—you being gathered together, also my spirit—with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
to deliver up such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus. 
Your glorying is not good; have you not known that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 
Cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are unleavened, for our Passover was sacrificed for us also—Christ, 
so that we may keep the celebration, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
I wrote to you in the letter, not to keep company with whoremongers— 
and certainly not with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing you ought then to go forth out of the world— 
and now, I wrote to you not to keep company with him, if anyone, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—do not even eat together with such a one; 
for what have I also to judge those outside? Do you not judge those within? 
And judge those without God; and put away the evil from among yourselves.
