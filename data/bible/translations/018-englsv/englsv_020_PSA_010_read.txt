Psalms.
Chapter 10.
Why, YHWH, do You stand at a distance? Do You hide in times of adversity? 
Through the pride of the wicked, || Is the poor inflamed, || They are caught in schemes that they devised. 
Because the wicked has boasted || Of the desire of his soul, || And he has blessed a dishonest gainer, || He has despised YHWH. 
The wicked does not inquire according to the height of his face. “There is no God!” are all his schemes. 
His ways writhe at all times, || Your judgments are on high before him, || All his adversaries—he puffs at them. 
He has said in his heart, “I am not moved, || And am not in calamity to generation and generation.” 
His mouth is full of oaths, || And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue is perverseness and iniquity, 
He sits in an ambush of the villages, || He slays the innocent in secret places. His eyes secretly watch for the afflicted, 
He lies in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lies in wait to catch the poor, || He catches the poor, drawing him into his net. 
He is bruised—he bows down, || The afflicted has fallen by his mighty ones. 
He said in his heart, “God has forgotten, || He has hid His face, || He has never seen.” 
Arise, O YHWH! O God, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the humble. 
Why has the wicked despised God? He has said in his heart, “It is not required.” 
You have seen, || For You behold perverseness and anger; By giving into Your hand, || The afflicted leave it on You, || You have been a helper of the fatherless. 
Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, || Seek out his wickedness, find none; 
YHWH is King for all time and forever, || The nations have perished out of His land! 
You have heard the desire of the humble, O YHWH. You prepare their heart; You cause Your ear to attend, 
To judge the fatherless and bruised: He adds no more to oppress—man of the earth!
