Job.
Chapter 40.
And YHWH answers Job and says: 
“Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God, let him answer it.” 
And Job answers YHWH and says: 
“Behold, I have been vile, || What do I return to You? I have placed my hand on my mouth. 
I have spoken once, and I do not answer, || And twice, and I do not add.” 
And YHWH answers Job out of the whirlwind and says: 
“Now gird your loins as a man, || I ask you, and you cause Me to know. 
Do you also make My judgment void? Do you condemn Me, || That you may be righteous? 
And do you have an arm like God? And do you thunder with a voice like His? 
Now put on excellence and loftiness, || Indeed, put on splendor and beauty. 
Scatter abroad the wrath of your anger, || And see every proud one, and make him low. 
See every proud one—humble him, || And tread down the wicked in their place. 
Hide them in the dust together, || Bind their faces in secret. 
And even I praise you, || For your right hand gives salvation to you. 
Now behold, behemoth, || That I made with you: He eats grass as an ox. 
Now behold, his power is in his loins, || And his strength in the muscles of his belly. 
He bends his tail as a cedar, || The sinews of his thighs are wrapped together, 
His bones are tubes of bronze, || His bones are as a bar of iron. 
He is a beginning of the ways of God, || His Maker alone brings His sword near; 
For mountains bear food for him, || And all the beasts of the field play there. 
He lies down under shades, || In a secret place of reed and marsh. 
Shades cover him, with their shadow, || Willows of the brook cover him. 
Behold, a flood oppresses—he does not hurry, || He is confident though Jordan || Comes forth to his mouth. 
Does one take him by his eyes? || Does one pierce the nose with snares?”
