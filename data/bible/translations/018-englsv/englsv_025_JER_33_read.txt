Jeremiah.
Chapter 33.
And there is a word of YHWH to Jeremiah a second time—and he is yet detained in the court of the prison—saying: 
“Thus said YHWH who has made it, YHWH who has formed it, to establish it, YHWH is His Name: 
Call to Me, and I answer you, indeed, I declare to you great and inaccessible things—you have not known them. 
For thus said YHWH, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah that are broken down for the siege mounds, and for the tool; 
they are coming to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the carcasses of men, whom I have struck in My anger, and in My fury, and for whom I have hidden My face from this city, because of all their evil: 
Behold, I am increasing health and cure to it, || And have healed them, and revealed to them || The abundance of peace and truth. 
And I have turned back the captivity of Judah, || And the captivity of Israel, || And I have built them as at the first, 
And cleansed them from all their iniquity || That they have sinned against Me, || And I have pardoned all their iniquities || That they have sinned against Me, || And that they transgressed against Me. 
And it has been for a name of joy to Me, || For praise, and for beauty, to all nations of the earth, || Who hear of all the good that I am doing them, || And they have feared, || And they have trembled for all the good, || And for all the peace, that I am doing to it.” 
Thus said YHWH: “Again is heard in this place—of which you are saying, It is dry, without man and without beast, || In cities of Judah, and in streets of Jerusalem, || That are desolated, without man, || And without inhabitant, and without beast— 
A voice of joy and a voice of gladness, || Voice of bridegroom and voice of bride, || The voice of those saying, || Thank YHWH of Hosts, for YHWH is good, || For His kindness is for all time, || Who are bringing in thanksgiving to the house of YHWH, || For I return the captivity of the land, || As at the first,” said YHWH. 
Thus said YHWH of Hosts: “Again there is in this place—that is dry, || Without man and beast, || And in all its cities—a habitation of shepherds, || Causing the flock to lie down. 
In the cities of the hill-country, || In the cities of the low country, || And in the cities of the south, || And in the land of Benjamin, || And in the outskirts of Jerusalem, || And in the cities of Judah, || Again the flock passes by under the hands of the numberer,” said YHWH. 
“Behold, days are coming,” a declaration of YHWH, “And I have established the good word || That I spoke to the house of Israel, || And concerning the house of Judah. 
In those days, and at that time, || I cause a Shoot of righteousness to shoot up to David, || And He has done judgment and righteousness in the earth. 
In those days Judah is saved, || And Jerusalem dwells confidently, || And this is what she is called: YHWH is Our Righteousness.” 
For thus said YHWH: “A man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel is never cut off from David, 
And to the priests—the Levites, || A man is not cut off from before My face, || Causing a burnt-offering to ascend, || And perfuming a present, and making sacrifice—all the days.” 
And there is a word of YHWH to Jeremiah, saying, 
“Thus said YHWH: If you can break My covenant with the day, || And My covenant with the night, || So that they are not daily and nightly in their season, 
My covenant is also broken with My servant David, || So that he does not have a son reigning on his throne, || And with the Levites the priests, My ministers. 
As the host of the heavens is not numbered, || Nor the sand of the sea measured, || So I multiply the seed of My servant David, || And My ministers the Levites.” 
And there is a word of YHWH to Jeremiah, saying, 
“Have you not considered what this people have spoken, saying, || The two families on which YHWH fixed, || He rejects them? And they despise My people, so that they are no longer a people before them!” 
Thus said YHWH: “If My covenant is not with day and night, || And if I have not appointed the statutes of the heavens and earth— 
I also reject the seed of Jacob, and My servant David, || From taking rulers from his seed || For the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, || For I return their captivity, and have pitied them.”
