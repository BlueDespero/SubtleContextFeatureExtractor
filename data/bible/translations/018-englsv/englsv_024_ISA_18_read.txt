Isaiah.
Chapter 18.
Behold, land shadowed with wings, || That is beyond the rivers of Cush, 
That is sending ambassadors by sea, || Even with implements of reed on the face of the waters—Go, swift messengers, || To a nation drawn out and peeled, || To a people fearful from its beginning and onward, || A nation meeting out by line, and treading down, || Whose land floods have spoiled. 
All you inhabitants of the world, || And you dwellers of earth, || At the lifting up of an ensign on hills you look, || And at the blowing of a horn you hear. 
For thus said YHWH to me: “I rest, and I look on My settled place, || As a clear heat on an herb. As a thick cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. 
For before harvest, when the flower is perfect, || And the blossom is producing unripe fruit, || Then One has cut the sprigs with pruning hooks, || And the branches He has turned aside, cut down. 
They are left together to the ravenous bird of the mountains, || And to the beast of the earth, || And the ravenous bird has summered on them, || And every beast of the earth winters on them. 
At that time a present is brought to YHWH of Hosts, || A nation drawn out and peeled. Even of a people fearful from the beginning until now, || A nation meting out by line, and treading down, || Whose land floods have spoiled, || To the place of the Name of YHWH of Hosts—Mount Zion!”
