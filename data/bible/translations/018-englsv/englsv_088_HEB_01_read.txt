The Letter to the Hebrews.
Chapter 1.
In many parts and many ways, God, having spoken long ago to the fathers by the prophets, 
in these last days speaks to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the ages; 
who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also all things by the saying of His might—having made a cleansing of our sins through Himself, sat down at the right hand of the Greatness in the highest, 
having become so much better than the messengers, as He inherited a more excellent name than them. 
For to which of the messengers did He ever say, “You are My Son—today I have begotten You?” And again, “I will be to Him for a Father, and He will be to Me for a Son?” 
And when again He may bring the firstborn into the world, He says, “And let them worship Him—all messengers of God”; 
and to the messengers, indeed, He says, “The One who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire”; 
but to the Son: “Your throne, O God, is agelong and continuous; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom; 
You loved righteousness, and hated lawlessness; Because of this He anointed You—God, Your God—With oil of gladness above Your partners”; 
and, “You, LORD, founded the earth at the beginning, || And the heavens are a work of Your hands. 
These will perish, but You remain, || And all will become old as a garment, 
And You will roll them together as a mantle, and they will be changed, || But You are the same, and Your years will not fail.” 
And to which of the messengers did He ever say, “Sit at My right hand, || Until I may make Your enemies Your footstool?” 
Are they not all spirits of service—being sent forth for ministry because of those about to inherit salvation?
