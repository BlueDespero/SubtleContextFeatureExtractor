The First Letter of Peter.
Chapter 1.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctification of the Spirit, to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied to you! 
Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the abundance of His kindness begot us again to a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ out of the dead, 
to an incorruptible inheritance, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved for you in the heavens, 
who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, to salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, 
in which you are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in various trials, 
so that the proof of your faith—much more precious than gold that is perishing, and being approved through fire—may be found to result in praise, and honor, and glory, at the revelation of Jesus Christ, 
whom, having not seen, you love, in whom, now believing although not seeing, you are glad with unspeakable joy and have been filled with glory, 
receiving the outcome of the faith—salvation of your souls; 
concerning which salvation the prophets sought out and searched out, who prophesied concerning the grace toward you, 
searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was signifying, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these, 
to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who proclaimed good news to you), by the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven, to which things messengers desire to look into intently. 
For this reason, having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly on the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 
as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance, 
but according as He who called you is holy, you also, become holy in all behavior, 
because it has been written: “Become holy, because I am holy”; 
and if you call on the Father, who is judging without favoritism according to the work of each, pass the time of your sojourn in fear, 
having known that, not with corruptible things—silver or gold—were you redeemed from your foolish behavior inherited from our forefathers, 
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted—Christ’s— 
foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and revealed in the last times because of you, 
who through Him believe in God who raised Him out of the dead, and gave glory to Him, so that your faith and hope may be in God. 
Having purified your souls in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to unhypocritical brotherly love, love one another earnestly out of a pure heart, 
being begotten again, not out of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, through a word of God—living and remaining—throughout the age; 
because all flesh is as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; the grass withered, and the flower of it fell away, 
but the saying of the LORD remains—throughout the age; and this is the saying of good news that was proclaimed to you.
