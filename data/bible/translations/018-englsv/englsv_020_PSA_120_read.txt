Psalms.
Chapter 120.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. I have called to YHWH in my distress, || And He answers me. 
O YHWH, deliver my soul from a lying lip, || From a deceitful tongue! 
What does He give to you? And what does He add to you? O deceitful tongue! 
Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with coals of broom trees. 
Woe to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, || I have dwelt with tents of Kedar. 
My soul has dwelt too much with him who is hating peace. 
I—peace, and when I speak they are for war!
