Proverbs.
Chapter 13.
A wise son—the instruction of a father, || And a scorner—he has not heard rebuke. 
A man eats good from the fruit of the mouth, || And the soul of the treacherous—violence. 
Whoever is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, || Whoever is opening wide his lips—ruin to him! 
The soul of the slothful is desiring, and does not have. And the soul of the diligent is made fat. 
The righteous hates a false word, || And the wicked causes abhorrence, and is confounded. 
Righteousness keeps him who is perfect in the way, || And wickedness overthrows a sin offering. 
There is he who is making himself rich, and has nothing, || Who is making himself poor, and wealth is abundant. 
The ransom of a man’s life are his riches, || And the poor has not heard rebuke. 
The light of the righteous rejoices, || And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished. 
A vain man causes debate through pride, || And wisdom is with the counseled. 
Wealth from vanity becomes little, || And whoever is gathering by the hand becomes great. 
Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, || And a tree of life is the coming desire. 
Whoever is despising the word is destroyed for it, || And whoever is fearing the command is repaid. 
The law of the wise is a fountain of life, || To turn aside from snares of death. 
Good understanding gives grace, || And the way of the treacherous is hard. 
Every prudent one deals with knowledge, || And a fool spreads out folly. 
A wicked messenger falls into evil, || And a faithful ambassador is healing. 
Whoever is refusing instruction—poverty and shame, || And whoever is observing reproof is honored. 
A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, || And an abomination to fools || Is to turn from evil. 
Whoever is walking with wise men is wise, || And a companion of fools suffers evil. 
Evil pursues sinners, || And good repays the righteous. 
A good man causes sons’ sons to inherit, || And the sinner’s wealth is laid up for the righteous. 
Abundance of food—the tillage of the poor, || And substance is consumed without judgment. 
Whoever is sparing his rod is hating his son, || And whoever is loving him has hurried his discipline. 
The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, || And the belly of the wicked lacks!
