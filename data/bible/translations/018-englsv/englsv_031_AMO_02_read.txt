Amos.
Chapter 2.
Thus said YHWH: “For three transgressions of Moab, || And for four, I do not reverse it, || Because of his burning the bones of the king of Edom to lime, 
And I have sent a fire against Moab, || And it has consumed the palaces of Kerioth, || And Moab is dying with noise, || With shouting, with voice of a horn. 
And I have cut off judge from her midst, || And I slay all its heads with him,” said YHWH. 
Thus said YHWH: “For three transgressions of Judah, || And for four, I do not reverse it, || Because of their loathing the Law of YHWH, || And His statutes they have not kept, || And their lies cause them to err, || After which their fathers walked, 
And I have sent a fire against Judah, || And it has consumed palaces of Jerusalem.” 
Thus said YHWH: “For three transgressions of Israel, || And for four, I do not reverse it, || Because of their selling the righteous for silver, || And the needy for a pair of sandals. 
Who are panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, || And the way of the humble they turn aside, || And a man and his father go to the girl, || So as to defile My holy Name. 
And they stretch themselves on pledged garments near every altar, || And the wine of fined ones they drink in the house of their gods. 
And I have destroyed the Amorite from before them, || Whose height is as the height of cedars, || And he is strong as the oaks, || And I destroy his fruit from above, || And his roots from beneath. 
And I have brought you up from the land of Egypt, || And cause you to go in a wilderness forty years, || To possess the land of the Amorite. 
And I raise of your sons for prophets, || And of your choice ones for Nazarites, || Is this not true, O sons of Israel?” A declaration of YHWH. 
“And you cause the Nazarites to drink wine, || And on the prophets you have laid a charge, || Saying, Do not prophesy! 
Behold, I am pressing you under, || As the full cart presses a sheaf for itself. 
And refuge has perished from the swift, || And the strong does not strengthens his power, || And the mighty does not deliver his soul. 
And the handler of the bow does not stand, || And the swift does not deliver himself with his feet, || And the rider of the horse does not deliver his soul. 
And the courageous of heart among the mighty, || Flees naked in that day,” || A declaration of YHWH!
