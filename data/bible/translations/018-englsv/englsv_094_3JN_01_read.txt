The Third Letter of John.
Chapter 1.
The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth! 
Beloved, I desire you to prosper concerning all things, and to be in health, even as your soul prospers, 
for I rejoiced exceedingly, brothers coming and testifying of the truth in you, even as you walk in truth; 
I have no joy greater than these things, that I may hear of my children walking in truth. 
Beloved, you act faithfully in whatever you may do toward the brothers and the one among strangers, 
who testified of your love before an assembly, whom you will do well, having sent forward worthily of God, 
because they went forth for His Name, receiving nothing from the nations; 
we, then, ought to receive such, that we may become fellow-workers to the truth. 
I wrote to the assembly, but he who is loving to be first among them—Diotrephes—does not receive us; 
because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he does, talking nonsense against us with evil words; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and he forbids those intending to receive them, and he casts them out of the assembly. 
Beloved, do not be following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, he is of God, but he who is doing evil has not seen God; 
testimony has been given to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself, and we also—we testify, and you have known that our testimony is true. 
Many things I had to write, but I do not wish to write to you through ink and pen, 
and I hope to see you soon, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to you! The friends greet you. Be greeting the friends by name.
