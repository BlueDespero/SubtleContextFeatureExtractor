Song of Songs.
Chapter 3.
On my bed by night, I sought him whom my soul has loved; I sought him, and I did not find him! 
Now let me rise, and go around the city, || In the streets and in the broad places, || I seek him whom my soul has loved! I sought him, and I did not find him. 
The watchmen have found me || (Who are going around the city), || “Have you seen him whom my soul has loved?” 
But I passed on a little from them, || Until I found him whom my soul has loved! I seized him, and did not let him go, || Until I brought him to the house of my mother—And the chamber of her that conceived me. 
I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, || By the roes or by the does of the field, || Do not stir up nor wake the love until she pleases! 
Who is this coming up from the wilderness, || Like palm-trees of smoke, || Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, || From every powder of the merchant? 
Behold, his couch, that is of Solomon, || Sixty mighty ones are around it, || Of the mighty of Israel, 
All of them holding sword, taught of battle, || Each his sword by his thigh, for fear at night. 
A palanquin King Solomon made for himself, || Of the wood of Lebanon, 
Its pillars he made of silver, || Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, || Its midst lined with love, || By the daughters of Jerusalem. 
Go forth, and look, you daughters of Zion, || On King Solomon, with the crown, || With which his mother crowned him, || In the day of his espousals, || And in the day of the joy of his heart!
