Psalms.
Chapter 140.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Deliver me, O YHWH, from an evil man, || Keep me from one of violence. 
Who have devised evils in the heart, || All the day they assemble for wars. 
They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, || Poison of a viper is under their lips. Selah. 
Preserve me, YHWH, from the hands of the wicked, || Keep me from one of violence, || Who have devised to overthrow my steps. 
The proud hid a snare for me—and cords, || They spread a net by the side of the path, || They have set snares for me. Selah. 
I have said to YHWH, “You are my God, || Hear, YHWH, the voice of my supplications.” 
O YHWH, my Lord, strength of my salvation, || You have covered my head in the day of armor. 
Do not grant, O YHWH, the desires of the wicked, || Do not bring forth his wicked scheme, || They are high. Selah. 
The chief of my surrounders, || The perverseness of their lips covers them. 
They cause burning coals to fall on themselves, || He casts them into fire, || Into deep pits—they do not arise. 
A talkative man is not established in the earth, || One of violence—evil hunts to overflowing. 
I have known that YHWH executes || The judgment of the afflicted, || The judgment of the needy. 
Surely the righteous give thanks to Your Name, || The upright dwell with Your presence!
