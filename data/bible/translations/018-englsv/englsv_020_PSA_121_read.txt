Psalms.
Chapter 121.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. I lift up my eyes to the hills, || From where does my help come? 
My help is from YHWH, || Maker of the heavens and earth, 
He does not permit your foot to be moved, || He who is preserving you does not slumber. 
Behold, He does not slumber, nor sleep, || He who is preserving Israel. 
YHWH is He who is preserving you, || YHWH is your shade on your right hand, 
By day the sun does not strike you, || Nor the moon by night. 
YHWH preserves you from all evil, || He preserves your soul. 
YHWH preserves your going out and your coming in, || From now on—even for all time!
