Psalms.
Chapter 103.
BY DAVID. Bless, O my soul, YHWH, || And all my inward parts—His Holy Name. 
Bless, O my soul, YHWH, || And do not forget all His benefits, 
Who is forgiving all your iniquities, || Who is healing all your diseases, 
Who is redeeming your life from destruction, || Who is crowning you with kindness and mercies, 
Who is satisfying your desire with good, || Your youth renews itself as an eagle. 
YHWH is doing righteousness and judgments || For all the oppressed. 
He makes His ways known to Moses, || His acts to the sons of Israel. 
YHWH is merciful and gracious, || Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy. 
He does not strive forever, || Nor does He watch for all time. 
He has not done to us according to our sins, || Nor according to our iniquities || Has He conferred benefits on us. 
For as the height of the heavens is above the earth, || His kindness has been mighty over those fearing Him. 
He has put our transgressions far from us—as the distance of east from west. 
As a father has mercy on sons, || YHWH has mercy on those fearing Him. 
For He has known our frame, || Remembering that we are dust. 
Mortal man! His days are as grass, || He flourishes as a flower of the field; 
For a wind has passed over it, and it is not, || And its place does not discern it anymore. 
And the kindness of YHWH || Is from age even to age on those fearing Him, || And His righteousness to sons’ sons, 
To those keeping His covenant, || And to those remembering His precepts to do them. 
YHWH has established His throne in the heavens, || And His kingdom has ruled over all. 
Bless YHWH, you His messengers, || Mighty in power—doing His word, || To listen to the voice of His word. 
Bless YHWH, all you His hosts, || His ministers—doing His pleasure. 
Bless YHWH, all you His works, || In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, YHWH!
