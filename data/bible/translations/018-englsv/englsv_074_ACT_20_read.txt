Acts.
Chapter 20.
And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called near the disciples, and having embraced them, went forth to go on to Macedonia; 
and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece; 
and having continued three months—a counsel of the Jews having been against him—being about to set forth to Syria, there came to him a resolution of returning through Macedonia. 
And there were accompanying him to Asia, Sopater of Pyrrhus from Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asians Tychicus and Trophimus; 
these, having gone before, remained for us in Troas, 
and we sailed, after the days of the Unleavened Bread, from Philippi, and came to them to Troas in five days, where we abided seven days. 
And on the first day of the weeks, the disciples having been gathered together to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, about to depart on the next day, he was also continuing the discourse until midnight, 
and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they were gathered together, 
and there a certain youth was sitting, by name Eutychus, on the window—being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul discoursing long—he having sunk down from the sleep, fell down from the third story, and was lifted up dead. 
And Paul, having gone down, fell on him, and having embraced him, said, “Make no tumult, for his life is in him”; 
and having come up, and having broken bread, and having tasted, for a long time also having talked—until daylight, so he went forth, 
and they brought up the boy alive, and were comforted in no ordinary measure. 
And we having gone before to the ship, sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go on foot; 
and when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene, 
and there having sailed, on the next day we came opposite Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus, 
for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus, that there may not be to him a loss of time in Asia, for he was hurrying, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of the Pentecost. 
And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the assembly, 
and when they were come to him, he said to them, “You know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how I was with you at all times; 
serving the LORD with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against me; 
how I kept back nothing of what things are profitable, not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every house, 
testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, conversion toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
And now, behold, I—bound in the Spirit—go on to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will befall me in it, 
except that the Holy Spirit fully testifies in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations remain for me; 
but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy, and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the good news of the grace of God. 
And now, behold, I have known that you will no longer see my face, among all you to whom I went preaching the Kingdom of God; 
for this reason I take you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all, 
for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God. 
Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the Assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood, 
for I have known this, that there will enter in, after my departing, grievous wolves to you, not sparing the flock, 
and there will arise men of your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 
Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and day, I did not cease with tears warning each one; 
and now, I commend you, brothers, to God, and to the word of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those sanctified. 
I coveted the silver or gold or clothing of no one; 
and you yourselves know that to my necessities, and to those who were with me, these hands ministered; 
I showed you all things, that, thus laboring, it is necessary to partake with the ailing, to also be mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said: It is more blessed to give than to receive.” 
And having said these things, having bowed his knees, with them all, he prayed, 
and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen on the neck of Paul, they were kissing him, 
sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said—that they are about to see his face no longer; and they were accompanying him to the ship.
