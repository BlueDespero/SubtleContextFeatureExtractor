Isaiah.
Chapter 27.
In that day YHWH lays a charge, || With His sword—the sharp, and the great, and the strong, || On leviathan—a fleeing serpent, || And on leviathan—a crooked serpent, || And He has slain the dragon that is in the sea. 
In that day respond to her, “A desirable vineyard, 
I, YHWH, am its keeper, || I water it every moment, || Lest any lay a charge against it, || Night and day I keep it! 
Fury is not in Me; Who gives Me a brier—a thorn in battle? I step into it, || I burn it at once. 
Or—he takes hold on My strength, || That he makes peace with Me, || And he makes peace with Me.” 
He causes those coming in to take root, || Jacob blossoms, and Israel has flourished, || And they have filled the face of the world with increase. 
Has He struck him as the striking of his striker? Does He slay as the slaying of his slain? 
In measure, in sending it forth, you strive with it, || He has taken away by His sharp wind, || In the day of an east wind, 
Therefore the iniquity of Jacob is covered by this, || And this is all the fruit—To take away his sin, || In his setting all the stones of an altar, || As chalkstones beaten in pieces, || They do not rise—Asherim and images. 
For the fortified city is alone, || A habitation cast out and forsaken as a wilderness, || There the calf delights, || And there it lies down, || And has consumed its branches. 
In the withering of its branch it is broken off, || Women are coming in and setting it on fire, || For it is not a people of understanding, || Therefore its Maker does not pity it, || And its Former does not favor it. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || YHWH beats out from the branch of the river, || To the stream of Egypt, || And you are gathered one by one, O sons of Israel. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || It is blown with a great horn, || And those perishing in the land of Asshur have come in, || And those cast out in the land of Egypt, || And have bowed themselves to YHWH, || In the holy mountain—in Jerusalem!
