Isaiah.
Chapter 4.
And seven women have taken hold on one man, || In that day, saying, “We eat our own bread, || And we put on our own raiment, || Only, let your name be called over us, || Remove our reproach.” 
In that day is the Shoot of YHWH for desire and for glory, || And the fruit of the earth || For excellence and for beauty to the escaped of Israel. 
And it has been, he who is left in Zion, || And he who is remaining in Jerusalem, “Holy” is said of him, || Of everyone who is written for life in Jerusalem. 
If the Lord has washed away || The filth of daughters of Zion, || And purges the blood of Jerusalem from her midst, || By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 
Then YHWH has created || Over every fixed place of Mount Zion, || And over her convocations, || A cloud by day, and smoke, || And the shining of a flaming fire by night, || That over all glory—a safeguard, 
And a covering may be, || For a shadow from drought by day, || And for a refuge, and for a hiding place, || From inundation and from rain!
