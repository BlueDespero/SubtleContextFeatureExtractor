Psalms.
Chapter 7.
A SHIGGAION OF DAVID, THAT HE SUNG TO YHWH CONCERNING THE WORDS OF CUSH, A BENJAMITE. O YHWH, my God, in You I have trusted, || Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me. 
Lest he tear my soul as a lion, || Tearing, and there is no deliverer. 
O YHWH, my God, if I have done this, || If there is iniquity in my hands, 
If I have done my well-wisher evil, || And draw my adversary without cause, 
Then an enemy pursues my soul, and overtakes, || And treads down my life to the earth, || And places my glory in the dust. Selah. 
Rise, O YHWH, in Your anger, || Be lifted up at the wrath of my adversaries, || And awake Yourself for me: You have commanded judgment. 
And a congregation of peoples surround You, || And over it turn back on high. 
YHWH judges the peoples; Judge me, O YHWH, || According to my righteousness, || And according to my integrity that is on me. 
Please let the evil of the wicked be ended, || And establish the righteous, || And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God. 
My shield is on God, || Savior of the upright in heart! 
God is judging right, || And He is not angry at all times. 
If one does not turn, || He sharpens His sword, || He has bent His bow and He prepares it, 
Indeed, He has prepared for Himself || Instruments of death, || He makes His arrows for burning pursuers. 
Behold, he travails with iniquity, || And he has conceived perverseness, || And has brought forth falsehood. 
He has prepared a pit, and he digs it, || And he falls into a ditch he makes. 
His perverseness returns on his head, || And his violence comes down on his crown. 
I thank YHWH, || According to His righteousness, || And I praise the Name of YHWH Most High!
