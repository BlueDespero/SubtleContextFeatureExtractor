Isaiah.
Chapter 54.
“Sing, O barren, she who has not borne! Break forth with singing, and cry aloud, || She who has not brought forth! For more are the sons of the desolate, || Than the sons of the married one,” said YHWH. 
“Enlarge the place of your tent, || And they stretch out the curtains of your dwelling places, || Do not restrain—lengthen your cords, || And make your pins strong. 
For you break forth right and left, || And nations possess your seed, 
And they cause desolate cities to be inhabited. Do not fear, for you are not ashamed, || Nor blush, for you are not confounded, || For you forget the shame of your youth, || And the reproach of your widowhood || You do not remember anymore. 
For your Maker is your husband, || YHWH of Hosts is His Name, || And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, || He is called God of all the earth. 
For as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, || YHWH has called you, || Even a youthful wife when she is refused,” said your God. 
“In a small moment I have forsaken you, || And in great mercies I gather you, 
In overflowing wrath I hid My face for a moment from you, || And in perpetual kindness I have loved you, || Said your Redeemer—YHWH! 
For this is as the days of Noah to Me, || In that I have sworn that the waters of Noah || Do not pass over the earth again—So I have sworn, || Wrath is not on you, || Nor rebuke against you. 
For the mountains depart, and the hills remove, || And My kindness does not depart from you, || And the covenant of My peace does not remove,” || Says YHWH, your loving one. 
“O afflicted, storm-tossed, not comforted, || Behold, I am laying your stones with cement, || And have founded you with sapphires, 
And have made your pinnacles of agate, || And your gates of carbuncle stones, || And all your border of stones of delight, 
And all your sons are taught of YHWH, || And the peace of your sons is abundant. 
You establish yourself in righteousness, || Be far from oppression, for you do not fear, || And from ruin, for it does not come near to you. 
Behold, he diligently assembles without My desire, || Whoever has assembled near you falls by you! 
Behold, I have created an artisan, || Blowing on a fire of coals, || And bringing out an instrument for his work, || And I have created a destroyer to destroy. 
No weapon formed against you prospers, || And every tongue rising against you, || You condemn in judgment. This is the inheritance of the servants of YHWH, || And their righteousness from Me,” a declaration of YHWH!
