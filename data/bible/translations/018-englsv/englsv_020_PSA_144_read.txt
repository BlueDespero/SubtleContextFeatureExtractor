Psalms.
Chapter 144.
BY DAVID. Blessed is YHWH my Rock, || Who is teaching My hands for war, || My fingers for battle. 
My kind one, and my bulwark, || My tower, and my deliverer, || My shield, and in whom I have trusted, || Who is subduing my people under me! 
YHWH, what is man that You know him? The son of man, that You esteem him? 
Man has been like a breath, || His days are as a shadow passing by. 
YHWH, incline Your heavens and come down, || Strike against mountains, and they smoke. 
Send forth lightning, and scatter them, || Send forth Your arrows, and trouble them, 
Send forth Your hand from on high, || Free me, and deliver me from many waters, || From the hand of sons of a stranger, 
Because their mouth has spoken vanity, || And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 
O God, I sing to You a new song, || I sing praise to You on a stringed instrument of ten strings. 
Who is giving deliverance to kings, || Who is freeing His servant David from the sword of evil. 
Free me, and deliver me || From the hand of sons of a stranger, || Because their mouth has spoken vanity, || And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood, 
Because our sons are as plants, || Becoming great in their youth, || Our daughters as hewn stones, || Polished—the likeness of a palace, 
Our granaries are full, bringing out from kind to kind, || Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, || Ten thousands in our out-places, 
Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, || And there is no outgoing, || And there is no crying in our broad places. 
O the blessedness of the people that is thus, || O the blessedness of the people whose God is YHWH!
