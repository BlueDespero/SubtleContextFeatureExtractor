Psalms.
Chapter 34.
BY DAVID, IN HIS CHANGING HIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE ABIMELECH, AND HE DRIVES HIM AWAY, AND HE GOES. ALEPH-BET I bless YHWH at all times, || His praise is continually in my mouth. 
In YHWH my soul boasts herself, || The humble hear and rejoice. 
Ascribe greatness to YHWH with me, || And we exalt His Name together. 
I sought YHWH, and He answered me, || And delivered me from all my fears. 
They looked expectingly to Him, || And they became bright, || And their faces are not ashamed. 
This poor one called, and YHWH heard, || And saved him from all his distresses. 
A messenger of YHWH is encamping, || Around those who fear Him, || And He arms them. 
Taste and see that YHWH is good, || O the blessedness of the man who trusts in Him. 
Fear YHWH, you His holy ones, || For there is no lack to those fearing Him. 
Young lions have lacked and been hungry, || And those seeking YHWH do not lack any good, 
Come, children, listen to me, || I teach you the fear of YHWH. 
Who is the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good? 
Keep your tongue from evil, || And your lips from speaking deceit. 
Turn aside from evil and do good, || Seek peace and pursue it. 
The eyes of YHWH are to the righteous, || And His ears to their cry. 
(The face of YHWH is on doers of evil, || To cut off their memorial from earth.) 
They cried, and YHWH heard, || And delivered them from all their distresses. 
YHWH is near to the broken of heart, || And He saves the bruised of spirit. 
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, || YHWH delivers him out of them all. 
He is keeping all his bones, || Not one of them has been broken. 
Evil puts the wicked to death, || And those hating the righteous are desolate. 
YHWH redeems the soul of His servants, || And none trusting in Him are desolate!
