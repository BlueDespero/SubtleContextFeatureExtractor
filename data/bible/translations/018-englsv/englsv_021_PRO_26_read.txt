Proverbs.
Chapter 26.
As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, || So honor is not fitting for a fool. 
As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, || So reviling without cause does not come. 
A whip is for a horse, a bridle for a donkey, || And a rod for the back of fools. 
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, || Lest you are like to him—even you. 
Answer a fool according to his folly, || Lest he is wise in his own eyes. 
He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, || Who is sending things by the hand of a fool. 
The two legs of the lame have been weak, || And an allegory in the mouth of fools. 
As one who is binding a stone in a sling, || So is he who is giving honor to a fool. 
A thorn has gone up into the hand of a drunkard, || And an allegory in the mouth of fools. 
The Former of all is great, || And He is rewarding a fool, || And is rewarding transgressors. 
As a dog has returned to its vomit, || A fool is repeating his folly. 
You have seen a man wise in his own eyes, || More hope of a fool than of him! 
The slothful has said, || “A lion is in the way, || A lion is in the broad places.” 
The door turns around on its hinge, || And the slothful on his bed. 
The slothful has hid his hand in a dish, || He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth. 
Wiser is the slothful in his own eyes, || Than seven men returning a reason. 
Laying hold on the ears of a dog, || Is a passer-by making himself wrath for strife that is not his own. 
As one pretending to be feeble, || Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death, 
So has a man deceived his neighbor, || And has said, “Am I not playing?” 
Fire is going out without wood, || And contention ceases without a tale-bearer, 
Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, || And a man of contentions to kindle strife. 
The words of a tale-bearer are as self-inflicted wounds, || And they have gone down to the inner parts of the heart. 
Silver of dross spread over potsherd, || Are burning lips and an evil heart. 
A hater pretends by his lips, || And he places deceit in his heart, 
When his voice is gracious do not trust in him, || For seven abominations are in his heart. 
Hatred is covered by deceit, || Its wickedness is revealed in an assembly. 
Whoever is digging a pit falls into it, || And the roller of a stone, it turns to him. 
A lying tongue hates its bruised ones, || And a flattering mouth works an overthrow!
