Isaiah.
Chapter 61.
“The Spirit of Lord YHWH is on Me, || Because YHWH anointed Me || To proclaim tidings to the humble, || He sent Me to bind the broken of heart, || To proclaim liberty to the captives, || And an opening of bands to those bound. 
To proclaim the year of the favor of YHWH, || And the day of vengeance of our God, || To comfort all mourners. 
To appoint to mourners in Zion, || To give to them beauty instead of ashes, || The oil of joy instead of mourning, || A covering of praise for a faded spirit, || And He is calling to them, Trees of righteousness, || The planting of YHWH—to be beautified.” 
And they have built the ancient ruins, || They raise up the desolations of the ancients, || And they have renewed ruined cities, || The desolations of generation and generation. 
And strangers have stood and fed your flock, || And the sons of a foreigner || Are your farmers and your vinedressers. 
And you are called priests of YHWH, || It is said of you that you are ministers of our God, || You consume the strength of nations, || And you boast yourselves in their glory. 
Instead of your shame—double honor, || And instead of confusion, || They rejoice in their portion, || Therefore they take possession in their land a second time, || Continuous joy is for them. 
“For I am YHWH, loving judgment, || Hating plunder for a burnt-offering, || And I have given their wage in truth, || And I make a perpetual covenant for them. 
And their seed has been known among the nations, || And their offspring in the midst of the peoples, || All their beholders acknowledge them, || For they are a seed YHWH has blessed.” 
I greatly rejoice in YHWH, || My soul rejoices in my God, || For He clothed me with garments of salvation, || And covered me with a robe of righteousness, || As a bridegroom prepares ornaments, || And as a bride puts on her jewels. 
For as the earth brings forth her shoots, || And as a garden causes its sown things to shoot up, || So Lord YHWH causes righteousness and praise || To shoot up before all the nations!
