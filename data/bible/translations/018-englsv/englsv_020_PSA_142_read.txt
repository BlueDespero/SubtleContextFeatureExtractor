Psalms.
Chapter 142.
AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID. A PRAYER WHEN HE IS IN THE CAVE. My voice is to YHWH, I cry, || My voice is to YHWH, I beg for grace. 
I pour forth my meditation before Him, || I declare my distress before Him. 
When my spirit has been feeble in me, || Then You have known my path; In the way in which I walk, || They have hid a snare for me. 
Looking on the right hand—and seeing, || And I have none recognizing; Refuge has perished from me, || There is none inquiring for my soul. 
I have cried to you, O YHWH, || I have said, “You are my refuge, || My portion in the land of the living.” 
Attend to my loud cry, || For I have become very low, || Deliver me from my pursuers, || For they have been stronger than I. 
Bring forth my soul from prison to confess Your Name, || The righteous surround me about, || When You confer benefits on me!
