Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A SONG OF THE ASCENTS. O the blessedness of everyone fearing YHWH, || Who is walking in His ways. 
You surely eat the labor of your hands, || You are blessed, and good is to you. 
Your wife is as a fruitful vine in the sides of your house, || Your sons as olive plants around your table. 
Behold, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing YHWH. 
YHWH blesses you out of Zion, || Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, || All the days of your life, 
And see the sons of your sons! Peace on Israel!
