Psalms.
Chapter 80.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET TO “LILIES OF TESTIMONY.” A PSALM OF ASAPH. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, || Leading Joseph as a flock, || Inhabiting the cherubim—shine forth, 
Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, || Wake up Your might, and come for our salvation. 
O God, cause us to turn back, || And cause Your face to shine, and we are saved. 
YHWH, God of Hosts, until when? You have burned against the prayer of Your people. 
You have caused them to eat bread of tears, || And cause them to drink || With tears a third time. 
You make us a strife to our neighbors, || And our enemies mock at it. 
God of Hosts, turn us back, || And cause Your face to shine, and we are saved. 
You bring a vine out of Egypt, || You cast out nations, and plant it. 
You have looked before it, and root it, || And it fills the land, 
Hills have been covered with its shadow, || And its boughs are cedars of God. 
It sends forth its branches to the sea, || And its shoots to the river. 
Why have You broken down its hedges, || And everyone passing by the way has plucked it? 
A boar out of the forest tears it, || And a wild beast of the fields grazes it. 
God of Hosts, turn back, we implore You, || Look from the heavens, and see, and inspect this vine, 
And the root that Your right hand planted, || And the branch You made strong for Yourself, 
Burned with fire—cut down, || They perish from the rebuke of Your face. 
Let Your hand be on the man of Your right hand || On the son of man You have strengthened for Yourself. 
And we do not go back from You, || You revive us, and in Your Name we call. 
O YHWH, God of Hosts, turn us back, || Cause Your face to shine, and we are saved!
