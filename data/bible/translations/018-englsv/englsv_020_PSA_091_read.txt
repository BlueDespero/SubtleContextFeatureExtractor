Psalms.
Chapter 91.
He who is dwelling || In the secret place of the Most High, || Habitually lodges in the shade of the Mighty, 
He is saying of YHWH, “My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,” 
For He delivers you from the snare of a fowler, || From a calamitous pestilence. 
He covers you over with His pinion, || And under His wings you trust, || His truth is a shield and buckler. 
You are not afraid of fear by night, || Of arrow that flies by day, 
Of pestilence that walks in thick darkness, || Of destruction that destroys at noon, 
One thousand fall at your side, || And a myriad at your right hand, || But it does not come near to you. 
But with your eyes you look, || And you see the reward of the wicked, 
(For You, O YHWH, are my refuge), || You made the Most High your habitation. 
Evil does not happen to you, || And a plague does not come near your tent, 
For He charges His messengers for you, || To keep you in all your ways, 
On the hands they bear you up, || Lest you strike your foot against a stone. 
You tread on lion and cobra, || You trample young lion and dragon. 
Because he has delighted in Me, || I also deliver him—I set him on high, || Because he has known My Name. 
He calls Me, and I answer him, || I am with him in distress, || I deliver him, and honor him. 
I satisfy him with the length of his days, || And I cause him to look on My salvation!
