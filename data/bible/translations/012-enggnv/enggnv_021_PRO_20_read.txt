Proverbs.
Chapter 20.
Wine is a mocker and strong drinke is raging: and whosoeuer is deceiued thereby, is not wise. 
The feare of the King is like the roaring of a lyon: hee that prouoketh him vnto anger, sinneth against his owne soule. 
It is a mans honour to cease from strife: but euery foole will be medling. 
The slouthfull will not plowe, because of winter: therefore shall he beg in sommer, but haue nothing. 
The counsell in the heart of man is like deepe waters: but a man that hath vnderstanding, will drawe it out. 
Many men wil boast, euery one of his owne goodnes: but who can finde a faithfull man? 
He that walketh in his integritie, is iust: and blessed shall his children be after him. 
A King that sitteth in the throne of iudgement, chaseth away all euill with his eyes. 
Who can say, I haue made mine heart cleane, I am cleane from my sinne? 
Diuers weightes, and diuers measures, both these are euen abomination vnto the Lord. 
A childe also is knowen by his doings, whether his worke be pure and right. 
The Lord hath made both these, euen the eare to heare, and the eye to see. 
Loue not sleepe least thou come vnto pouertie: open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
It is naught, it is naught, sayth the buyer: but when he is gone apart, he boasteth. 
There is golde, and a multitude of precious stones: but the lips of knowledge are a precious iewel. 
Take his garment, that is suretie for a stranger, and a pledge of him for the stranger. 
The bread of deceit is sweete to a man: but afterward his mouth shalbe filled with grauel. 
Establish the thoughtes by counsell: and by counsell make warre. 
He that goeth about as a slanderer, discouereth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 
He that curseth his father or his mother, his light shalbe put out in obscure darkenes. 
An heritage is hastely gotten at the beginning, but the end thereof shall not be blessed. 
Say not thou, I wil recompense euill: but waite vpon the Lord, and he shall saue thee. 
Diuers weightes are an abomination vnto the Lord, and deceitful balances are not good. 
The steps of man are ruled by the Lord: how can a man then vnderstand his owne way? 
It is a destruction for a man to deuoure that which is sanctified, and after the vowes to inquire. 
A wise King scattereth the wicked, and causeth the wheele to turne ouer them. 
The light of the Lord is the breath of man, and searcheth all the bowels of the belly. 
Mercie and trueth preserue the King: for his throne shall be established with mercie. 
The beautie of yong men is their strength, and the glory of the aged is the gray head. 
The blewnes of the wound serueth to purge the euill, and the stripes within the bowels of the belly.
