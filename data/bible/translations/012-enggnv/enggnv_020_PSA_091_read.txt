Psalms.
Chapter 91.
Who so dwelleth in the secrete of the most High, shall abide in the shadowe of the Almightie. 
I will say vnto the Lord, O mine hope, and my fortresse: he is my God, in him will I trust. 
Surely he will deliuer thee from the snare of the hunter, and from the noysome pestilence. 
Hee will couer thee vnder his winges, and thou shalt be sure vnder his feathers: his trueth shall be thy shielde and buckler. 
Thou shalt not be afraide of the feare of the night, nor of the arrowe that flyeth by day: 
Nor of the pestilence that walketh in the darkenesse: nor of the plague that destroyeth at noone day. 
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and tenne thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come neere thee. 
Doubtlesse with thine eyes shalt thou beholde and see the reward of the wicked. 
For thou hast said, The Lord is mine hope: thou hast set the most High for thy refuge. 
There shall none euill come vnto thee, neither shall any plague come neere thy tabernacle. 
For hee shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes. 
They shall beare thee in their handes, that thou hurt not thy foote against a stone. 
Thou shalt walke vpon the lyon and aspe: the yong lyon and the dragon shalt thou treade vnder feete. 
Because he hath loued me, therefore will I deliuer him: I will exalt him because hee hath knowen my Name. 
He shall call vpon me, and I wil heare him: I will be with him in trouble: I will deliuer him, and glorifie him. 
With long life wil I satisfie him, and shew him my saluation.
