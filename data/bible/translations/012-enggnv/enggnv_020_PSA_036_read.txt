Psalms.
Chapter 36.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid, the servant of the Lord. Wickedness sayeth to the wicked man, euen in mine heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes. 
For hee flattereth himselfe in his owne eyes, while his iniquitie is foud worthy to be hated. 
The wordes of his mouth are iniquitie and deceit: hee hath left off to vnderstand and to doe good. 
Hee imagineth mischiefe vpon his bed: he setteth himselfe vpon a way, that is not good, and doeth not abhorre euill. 
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth vnto the heauens, and thy faithfulnesse vnto the cloudes. 
Thy righteousnesse is like the mightie moutaines: thy iudgements are like a great deepe: thou, Lord, doest saue man and beast. 
How excellent is thy mercy, O God! therefore the children of men trust vnder the shadowe of thy wings. 
They shall be satisfied with the fatnesse of thine house, and thou shalt giue them drinke out of the riuer of thy pleasures. 
For with thee is the well of life, and in thy light shall we see light. 
Extend thy louing kindnes vnto them that knowe thee, and thy righteousnesse vnto them that are vpright in heart. 
Let not ye foote of pride come against me, and let not the hand of ye wicked men moue me. 
There they are fallen that worke iniquity: they are cast downe, and shall not be able to rise.
