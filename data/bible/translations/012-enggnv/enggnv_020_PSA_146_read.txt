Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise thou the Lord, O my soule. 
I will prayse the Lord during my life: as long as I haue any being, I wil sing vnto my God. 
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sonne of man, for there is none helpe in him. 
His breath departeth, and he returneth to his earth: then his thoughtes perish. 
Blessed is he, that hath the God of Iaakob for his helpe, whose hope is in the Lord his God. 
Which made heauen and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth his fidelitie for euer: 
Which executeth iustice for the oppressed: which giueth bread to the hungry: the Lord loseth the prisoners. 
The Lord giueth sight to the blinde: the Lord rayseth vp the crooked: the Lord loueth the righteous. 
The Lord keepeth the strangers: he relieueth the fatherlesse and widowe: but he ouerthroweth the way of the wicked. 
The Lord shall reigne for euer: O Zion, thy God endureth from generation to generation. Prayse ye the Lord.
