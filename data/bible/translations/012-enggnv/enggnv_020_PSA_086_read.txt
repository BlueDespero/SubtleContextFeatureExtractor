Psalms.
Chapter 86.
A prayer of David. Incline thine eare, O Lord, and heare me: for I am poore and needy. 
Preserue thou my soule, for I am mercifull: my God, saue thou thy seruant, that trusteth in thee. 
Be mercifull vnto me, O Lord: for I crie vpon thee continually. 
Reioyce the soule of thy seruant: for vnto thee, O Lord, doe I lift vp my soule. 
For thou, Lord, art good and mercifull, and of great kindenes vnto all them, that call vpon thee. 
Giue eare, Lord, vnto my prayer, and hearken to the voyce of my supplication. 
In the day of my trouble I will call vpon thee: for thou hearest me. 
Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord, and there is none that can doe like thy workes. 
All nations, whome thou hast made, shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorifie thy Name. 
For thou art great and doest wonderous things: thou art God alone. 
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walke in thy trueth: knit mine heart vnto thee, that I may feare thy Name. 
I wil prayse thee, O Lord my God, with all mine heart: yea, I wil glorifie thy Name for euer. 
For great is thy mercie toward me, and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest graue. 
O God, the proude are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men haue sought my soule, and haue not set thee before them. 
But thou, O Lord, art a pitifull God and mercifull, slowe to anger and great in kindenes and trueth. 
Turne vnto me, and haue mercy vpon me: giue thy strength vnto thy seruant, and saue the sonne of thine handmayd. 
Shew a token of thy goodnes towarde me, that they which hate me, may see it, and be ashamed, because thou, O Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
