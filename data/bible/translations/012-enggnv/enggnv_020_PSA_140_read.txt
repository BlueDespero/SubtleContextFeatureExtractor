Psalms.
Chapter 140.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. Deliuer me, O Lord, from the euill man: preserue me from the cruel man: 
Which imagine euill things in their heart, and make warre continually. 
They haue sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders poyson is vnder their lips. Selah. 
Keepe mee, O Lord, from the handes of the wicked: preserue mee from the cruell man, which purposeth to cause my steppes to slide. 
The proude haue layde a snare for me, and spred a nette with cordes in my pathway, and set grennes for me. Selah. 
Therefore I saide vnto the Lord, Thou art my God: heare, O Lord, the voyce of my prayers. 
O Lord God the strength of my saluation, thou hast couered mine head in the day of battel. 
Let not the wicked haue his desire, O Lord: performe not his wicked thought, least they be proude. Selah. 
As for the chiefe of them, that compasse me about, let the mischiefe of their owne lippes come vpon them. 
Let coles fal vpon them: let him cast them into the fire, and into the deepe pits, that they rise not. 
For the backbiter shall not be established vpon the earth: euill shall hunt the cruell man to destruction. 
I know that the Lord will auenge the afflicted, and iudge the poore. 
Surely the righteous shall prayse thy Name, and the iust shall dwell in thy presence.
