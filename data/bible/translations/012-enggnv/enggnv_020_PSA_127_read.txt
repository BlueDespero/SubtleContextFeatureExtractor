Psalms.
Chapter 127.
A song of degrees, or Psalme of Salomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the citie, the keeper watcheth in vaine. 
It is in vaine for you to rise earely, and to lie downe late, and eate the bread of sorow: but he wil surely giue rest to his beloued. 
Beholde, children are the inheritance of the Lord, and the fruite of the wombe his rewarde. 
As are the arrowes in the hand of ye strong man: so are the children of youth. 
Blessed is the man, that hath his quiuer full of them: for they shall not be ashamed, when they speake with their enemies in the gate.
