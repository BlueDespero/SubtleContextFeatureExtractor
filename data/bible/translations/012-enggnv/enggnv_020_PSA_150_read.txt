Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye God in his Sanctuarie: prayse ye him in the firmament of his power. 
Prayse ye him in his mightie Actes: prayse ye him according to his excellent greatnesse. 
Prayse ye him in the sounde of the trumpet: prayse yee him vpon the viole and the harpe. 
Prayse ye him with timbrell and flute: praise ye him with virginales and organs. 
Prayse ye him with sounding cymbales: prayse ye him with high sounding cymbales. 
Let euery thing that hath breath prayse the Lord. Prayse ye the Lord.
