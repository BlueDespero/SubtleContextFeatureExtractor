Psalms.
Chapter 33.
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becommeth vpright men to be thankefull. 
Prayse the Lord with harpe: sing vnto him with viole and instrument of ten strings. 
Sing vnto him a newe song: sing cheerefully with a loude voyce. 
For the word of the Lord is righteous, and all his workes are faithfull. 
He loueth righteousnesse and iudgement: the earth is full of the goodnesse of the Lord. 
By the worde of the Lord were the heauens made, and all the hoste of them by the breath of his mouth. 
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as vpon an heape, and layeth vp the depths in his treasures. 
Let all the earth feare the Lord: let al them that dwell in the world, feare him. 
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded, and it stood. 
The Lord breaketh the counsell of the heathen, and bringeth to nought the deuices of the people. 
The counsell of the Lord shall stand for euer, and the thoughts of his heart throughout all ages. 
Blessed is that nation, whose God is the Lord: euen the people that he hath chosen for his inheritance. 
The Lord looketh downe from heauen, and beholdeth all the children of men. 
From the habitation of his dwelling he beholdeth all them that dwell in the earth. 
He facioneth their hearts euery one, and vnderstandeth all their workes. 
The King is not saued by the multitude of an hoste, neither is the mightie man deliuered by great strength. 
A horse is a vaine helpe, and shall not deliuer any by his great strength. 
Beholde, the eye of the Lord is vpon them that feare him, and vpon them, that trust in his mercie, 
To deliuer their soules from death, and to preserue them in famine. 
Our soule waiteth for the Lord: for he is our helpe and our shielde. 
Surely our heart shall reioyce in him, because we trusted in his holy Name. 
Let thy mercie, O Lord, be vpon vs, as we trust in thee.
