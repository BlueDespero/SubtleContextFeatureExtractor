Psalms.
Chapter 67.
To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme or song. God be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs, and cause his face to shine among vs. Selah. 
That they may know thy way vpon earth, and thy sauing health among all nations. 
Let the people prayse thee, O God: let all the people prayse thee. 
Let the people be glad and reioyce: for thou shalt iudge the people righteously, and gouerne the nations vpon the earth. Selah. 
Let the people prayse thee, O God: let all the people prayse thee. 
Then shall the earth bring foorth her increase, and God, euen our God shall blesse vs. 
God shall blesse vs, and all the endes of the earth shall feare him.
