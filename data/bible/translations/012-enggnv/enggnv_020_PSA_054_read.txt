Psalms.
Chapter 54.
To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of David, to give instruction. When the Ziphims came and said unto Saul, Is not David hid among us? Save mee, O God, by thy Name, and by thy power iudge me. 
O God, heare my prayer: hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth. 
For strangers are risen vp against me, and tyrants seeke my soule: they haue not set God before them. Selah. 
Beholde, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that vpholde my soule. 
He shall rewarde euill vnto mine enemies: Oh cut them off in thy trueth! 
Then I will sacrifice freely vnto thee: I wil praise thy Name, O Lord, because it is good. 
For he hath deliuered me out of al trouble, and mine eye hath seene my desire vpon mine enemies.
