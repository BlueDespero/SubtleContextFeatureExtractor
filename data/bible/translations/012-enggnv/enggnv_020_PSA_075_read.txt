Psalms.
Chapter 75.
To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme or song committed toAsaph. We will prayse thee, O God, we will prayse thee, for thy Name is neere: therefore they will declare thy wonderous workes. 
When I shall take a conuenient time, I will iudge righteously. 
The earth and all the inhabitantes thereof are dissolued: but I will establish the pillars of it. Selah. 
I saide vnto the foolish, Be not so foolish, and to the wicked, Lift not vp the horne. 
Lift not vp your horne on high, neither speake with a stiffe necke. 
For to come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South, 
But God is the iudge: he maketh lowe and he maketh hie. 
For in the hand of the Lord is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixt, and he powreth out of the same: surely all the wicked of the earth shall wring out and drinke the dregges thereof. 
But I will declare for euer, and sing prayses vnto the God of Iaakob. 
All the hornes of the wicked also will I breake: but the hornes of the righteous shalbe exalted.
