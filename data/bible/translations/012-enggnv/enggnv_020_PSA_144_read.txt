Psalms.
Chapter 144.
A Psalme of David. Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth mine hands to fight, and my fingers to battell. 
He is my goodnes and my fortresse, my towre and my deliuerer, my shield, and in him I trust, which subdueth my people vnder me. 
Lord, what is man that thou regardest him! or the sonne of man that thou thinkest vpon him! 
Man is like to vanitie: his dayes are like a shadow, that vanisheth. 
Bow thine heauens, O Lord, and come downe: touch the mountaines and they shall smoke. 
Cast forth the lightning and scatter them: shoote out thine arrowes, and consume them. 
Send thine hand from aboue: deliuer me, and take me out of the great waters, and from the hand of strangers, 
Whose mouth talketh vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 
I wil sing a new song vnto thee, O God, and sing vnto thee vpon a viole, and an instrument of ten strings. 
It is he that giueth deliuerance vnto Kings, and rescueth Dauid his seruant from the hurtfull sworde. 
Rescue me, and deliuer me from the hand of strangers, whose mouth talketh vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falshood: 
That our sonnes may be as the plantes growing vp in their youth, and our daughters as the corner stones, grauen after the similitude of a palace: 
That our corners may be full, and abounding with diuers sorts, and that our sheepe may bring forth thousands and ten thousand in our streetes: 
That our oxen may be strong to labour: that there be none inuasion, nor going out, nor no crying in our streetes. 
Blessed are the people, that be so, yea, blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord.
