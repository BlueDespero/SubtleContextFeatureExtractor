Job.
Chapter 26.
Bvt Iob answered, and sayde, 
Whom helpest thou? him that hath no power? sauest thou the arme that hath no strength? 
Whome counsellest thou? him that hath no wisedome? thou shewest right well as the thing is. 
To whom doest thou declare these words? or whose spirit commeth out of thee? 
The dead things are formed vnder the waters, and neere vnto them. 
The graue is naked before him, and there is no couering for destruction. 
He stretcheth out the North ouer the emptie place, and hangeth the earth vpon nothing. 
He bindeth the waters in his cloudes, and the cloude is not broken vnder them. 
He holdeth backe the face of his throne: and spreadeth his cloude vpon it. 
He hath set bounds about the waters, vntil the day and night come to an ende. 
The pillars of heauen tremble and quake at his reproofe. 
The sea is calme by his power, and by his vnderstanding he smiteth the pride thereof. 
His Spirite hath garnished the heauens, and his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 
Loe, these are part of his wayes: but how litle a portion heare we of him? and who can vnderstand his fearefull power?
