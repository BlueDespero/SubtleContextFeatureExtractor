Psalms.
Chapter 47.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. All people clap your hands: sing loude vnto God with a ioyfull voyce. 
For the Lord is high, and terrible: a great King ouer all the earth. 
He hath subdued the people vnder vs, and the nations vnder our feete. 
Hee hath chosen our inheritance for vs: euen the glory of Iaakob whom he loued. Selah. 
God is gone vp with triumph, euen the Lord, with the sound of the trumpet. 
Sing prayses to God, sing prayses: sing prayses vnto our King, sing prayses. 
For God is the King of all the earth: sing prayses euery one that hath vnderstanding. 
God reigneth ouer the heathen: God sitteth vpon his holy throne. 
The princes of the people are gathered vnto the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the world belong to God: he is greatly to be exalted.
