Psalms.
Chapter 62.
To the excelletn musician Ieduthun. A Psalme of David. Yet my soule keepeth silence vnto God: of him commeth my saluation. 
Yet he is my strength and my saluation, and my defence: therefore I shall not much be mooued. 
How long wil ye imagine mischiefe against a man? ye shalbe all slaine: ye shalbe as a bowed wall, or as a wall shaken. 
Yet they consult to cast him downe from his dignitie: their delight is in lies, they blesse with their mouthes, but curse with their hearts. Selah. 
Yet my soule keepe thou silence vnto God: for mine hope is in him. 
Yet is hee my strength, and my saluation, and my defence: therefore I shall not be mooued. 
In God is my saluation and my glory, the rocke of my strength: in God is my trust. 
Trust in him alway, ye people: powre out your hearts before him, for God is our hope. Selah. 
Yet the children of men are vanitie, the chiefe men are lies: to lay them vpon a balance they are altogether lighter then vanitie. 
Trust not in oppression nor in robberie: be not vaine: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 
God spake once or twise, I haue heard it, that power belongeth vnto God, 
And to thee, O Lord, mercie: for thou rewardest euery one according to his worke.
