Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A song of degrees. Out of the deepe places haue I called vnto thee, O Lord. 
Lord, heare my voyce: let thine eares attend to the voyce of my prayers. 
If thou, O Lord, straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
But mercie is with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 
I haue waited on the Lord: my soule hath waited, and I haue trusted in his worde. 
My soule waiteth on the Lord more then the morning watch watcheth for the morning. 
Let Israel waite on the Lord: for with the Lord is mercie, and with him is great redemption. 
And he shall redeeme Israel from all his iniquities.
