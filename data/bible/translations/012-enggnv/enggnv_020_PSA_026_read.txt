Psalms.
Chapter 26.
A Psalme of David. Judge me, O Lord, for I haue walked in mine innocency: my trust hath bene also in the Lord: therefore shall I not slide. 
Proue me, O Lord, and trie mee: examine my reines, and mine heart. 
For thy louing kindnesse is before mine eyes: therefore haue I walked in thy trueth. 
I haue not hanted with vaine persons, neither kept companie with the dissemblers. 
I haue hated the assemblie of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked. 
I will wash mine handes in innocencie, O Lord, and compasse thine altar, 
That I may declare with the voyce of thankesgiuing, and set foorth all thy wonderous woorkes. 
O Lord, I haue loued the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 
Gather not my soule with the sinners, nor my life with the bloodie men: 
In whose handes is wickednes, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
But I will walke in mine innocencie: redeeme me therefore, and be mercifull vnto me. 
My foote standeth in vprightnesse: I will praise thee, O Lord, in the Congregations.
