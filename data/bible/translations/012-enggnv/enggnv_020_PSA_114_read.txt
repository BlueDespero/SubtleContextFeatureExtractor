Psalms.
Chapter 114.
When Israel went out of Egypt, and the house of Iaakob from the barbarous people, 
Iudah was his sanctification, and Israel his dominion. 
The Sea sawe it and fled: Iorden was turned backe. 
The mountaines leaped like rams, and the hils as lambes. 
What ailed thee, O Sea, that thou fleddest? O Iorden, why wast thou turned backe? 
Ye mountaines, why leaped ye like rams, and ye hils as lambes? 
The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Iaakob, 
Which turneth the rocke into waterpooles, and the flint into a fountaine of water.
