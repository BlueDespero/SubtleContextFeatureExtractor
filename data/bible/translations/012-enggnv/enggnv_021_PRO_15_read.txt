The tongue of the wise vseth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fooles babbleth out foolishnesse. 
The eyes of the Lord in euery place beholde the euill and the good.

The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the righteous is acceptable vnto him. 
The way of the wicked is an abomination vnto the Lord: but he loueth him that followeth righteousnes. 
Instruction is euill to him that forsaketh the way, and he that hateth correction, shall die. 
Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the sonnes of men?

A ioyfull heart maketh a chearefull countenance: but by the sorow of the heart the minde is heauie. 
The heart of him that hath vnderstanding, seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of the foole is fedde with foolishnes. 
All the dayes of the afflicted are euill: but a good conscience is a continuall feast. 
Better is a litle with the feare of the Lord, then great treasure, and trouble therewith. 
Better is a dinner of greene herbes where loue is, then a stalled oxe and hatred therewith. 
An angrie man stirreth vp strife: but hee that is slowe to wrath, appeaseth strife. 
The way of a slouthfull man is as an hedge of thornes: but the way of the righteous is plaine. 
A wise sonne reioyceth the father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
