Psalms.
Chapter 100.
A Psalme of Praise. Sing ye loude vnto the Lord, all the earth. 
Serue the Lord with gladnes: come before him with ioyfulnes. 
Knowe ye that euen the Lord is God: hee hath made vs, and not we our selues: we are his people, and the sheepe of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with prayse, and into his courts with reioycing: prayse him and blesse his Name. 
For the Lord is good: his mercy is euerlasting, and his trueth is from generation to generation.
