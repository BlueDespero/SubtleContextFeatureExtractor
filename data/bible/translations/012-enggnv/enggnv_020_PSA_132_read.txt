Psalms.
Chapter 132.
A song of degrees. Lord, remember Dauid with all his affliction. 
Who sware vnto the Lord, and vowed vnto the mightie God of Iaakob, saying, 
I will not enter into the tabernacle of mine house, nor come vpon my pallet or bed, 
Nor suffer mine eyes to sleepe, nor mine eye lids to slumber, 
Vntill I finde out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mightie God of Iaakob. 
Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah, and found it in the fieldes of the forest. 
We will enter into his Tabernacles, and worship before his footestoole. 
Arise, O Lord, to come into thy rest, thou, and the Arke of thy strength. 
Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousnesse, and let thy Saints reioyce. 
For thy seruant Dauids sake refuse not the face of thine Anointed. 
The Lord hath sworne in trueth vnto Dauid, and he wil not shrinke from it, saying, Of the fruite of thy body will I set vpon thy throne. 
If thy sonnes keepe my couenant, and my testimonies, that I shall teach them, their sonnes also shall sit vpon thy throne for euer. 
For the Lord hath chosen Zion, and loued to dwell in it, saying, 
This is my rest for euer: here will I dwell, for I haue a delite therein. 
I will surely blesse her vitailes, and will satisfie her poore with bread, 
And will clothe her Priests with saluation, and her Saints shall shoute for ioye. 
There will I make the horne of Dauid to bud: for I haue ordeined a light for mine Anoynted. 
His enemies will I clothe with shame, but on him his crowne shall florish.
