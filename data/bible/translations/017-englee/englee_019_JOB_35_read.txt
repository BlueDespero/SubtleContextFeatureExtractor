Job.
Chapter 35.
Then commenced Elihu, and said, 
Dost thou deem this to be just, that thou hast said, “My righteousness is more than God's?” 
For thou sayest, “What benefit will it be unto thee? what more profit shall I have, than if I had sinned?” 
I will truly reply unto thee with words, and unto thy friends with thee. 
Look unto the heavens, and see; and gaze on the skies which are higher than thou. 
If thou sin, what dost thou effect against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what canst thou do unto him? 
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what doth he accept out of thy hand? 
A man like thyself thy wickedness may reach, and a son of earth thy righteousness. 
By reason of the multitude of oppressions the wicked cause men to cry: these complain aloud because of the arm of the mighty. 
But man saith not, Where is God my maker, who bestoweth joyful songs even in the night; 
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of the heavens? 
There do they cry, but he answereth not: because of the pride of evil men. 
Only what is false will God not hear, nor will the Almighty regard it. 
Although thou sayest, thou canst not see him: yet the decision is before him; and do thou wait for him. 
But now, because his anger hath punished nothing, shall he not greatly take cognizance of the multitude of sins? 
But Job openeth wide his mouth for nought: without knowledge he heapeth up words.
