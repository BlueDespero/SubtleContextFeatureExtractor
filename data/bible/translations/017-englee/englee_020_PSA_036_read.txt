Psalms.
Chapter 36.
“To the chief musician, by the servant of the Lord, by David.” (36:2) Saith vice itself to the wicked—so I feel it within my heart— that he should have no dread of God before his eyes. 
(36:3) For he flattereth himself in his own eyes too much to find out his iniquity to hate it. 
(36:4) The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, to do good. 
(36:5) He deviseth wickedness upon his couch; he placeth himself on a way that is not good; evil he despiseth not. 
(36:6) O Lord, into the heavens reacheth thy kindness, thy faithfulness even into the skies. 
(36:7) Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy acts of justice like the great deep: man and beast dost thou ever help, O Lord. 
(36:8) How precious is thy kindness, O God! And the children of men that seek shelter under the shadow of thy wings,— 
(36:9) These will be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and of the stream of thy delights wilt thou give them to drink. 
(36:10) For with thee is the source of life: in thy light shall we see light. 
(36:11) Draw down continuously thy kindness unto those that acknowledge thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
(36:12) Let not come against me the foot of pride, and let not the hand of the wicked chase me off. 
(36:13) There are fallen the workers of wickedness: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
