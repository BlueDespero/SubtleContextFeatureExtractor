Psalms.
Chapter 19.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (19:2) The heavens relate the glory of God; and the expanse telleth of the works of his hands. 
(19:3) Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. 
(19:4) There is no speech, there are no words, their voice is not heard. 
(19:5) But their melody extendeth through all the earth, and to the end of the world their words. For the sun hath he set a tabernacle among them; 
(19:6) And he goeth out as a bridegroom from his chamber, he is glad like a strong man to run his course; 
(19:7) From the end of the heavens is his going forth, and his circuit is unto their ends: and there is nothing hidden from his heat. 
(19:8) The law of the Lord is perfect, quieting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. 
(19:9) The precepts of the Lord are upright, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes. 
(19:10) The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever: the ordinances of the Lord are the truth, they are just altogether. 
(19:11) They are those which are to be desired more than gold, and much fine gold; and they are sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycomb. 
(19:12) Moreover thy servant is admonished by them: in keeping them there is great reward. 
(19:13) Who can guard against errors? from secret faults do thou cleanse me. 
(19:14) Also from presumptuous sins withhold thy servant; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from any great transgression. 
(19:15) May the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer.
