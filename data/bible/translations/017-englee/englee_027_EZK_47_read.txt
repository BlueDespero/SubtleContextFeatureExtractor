Ezekiel.
Chapter 47.
And he brought me back again unto the door of the house: and, behold, water was issuing out from under the threshold of the house eastward; for the front of the house stood toward the east; and the water came down from under the threshold, from the right side of the house, to the south of the altar. 
Then did he bring me out by the way of the gate northwards and led me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looked eastward: and, behold, the water was running on the right side. 
When the man went forth eastward, having the measuring-line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, the water reaching to the ankles. 
Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through the water, the water reaching to the knees. Again he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through, the water reaching to the loins. 
And he measured again a thousand cubits, it being a stream that I could not wade through; for the water was increased, being water fit to swim in, a stream that could not be waded through. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this: Then did he lead me, and caused me to return to the bank of the stream. 
Now when I returned, behold, there were at the banks of the stream very many trees, on the one side and on the other. 
Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the eastern district, and go down into the plain, and fall into the sea, the waters being carried forth into the sea, so that the waters shall be healed. 
And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the double-stream shall come, shall live: and the fish shall be therein in great abundance; for when this water shall have come thither, the waters of the sea shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the stream cometh. 
And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand by it; from 'En-gedi even unto 'En-'eglayim, there shall be places for the spreading out of nets: after their various kinds shall the fish thereof be, like the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many. 
But its swamps and its lagoons shall not be healed, for the production of salt are they destined. 
And by the stream upon its banks, on this side and on that side, shall grow up all kinds of trees for food, the leaves of which shall not fade, and the fruit of which shall not come to an end, every month shall they bring forth new ripe fruit; because its water is that which issueth out of the sanctuary; and their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for remedies. 
Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This shall be the boundary, whereby ye shall divide out the land unto the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions. 
And ye shall inherit it, every one like the other, the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for an inheritance. 
And this shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, the road to Chethlon, as far as to Zedad; 
Chamath, Berothah, Sibrayim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Chamath; Chazar-hattichon, which is by the boundary of Chavran. 
And the boundary shall be from the sea to Chazar-'enon, the boundary of Damascus, and the northern part on the north, and the boundary of Chamath. And this is the north side. 
And the east side shall ye measure between Chavran and Damascus on the one side, and between Gil'ad and the land of Israel on the other side by the Jordan, from the north boundary unto the east sea. And this is the east side. 
And the south side; on the south, from Thamar even to the waters of contention at Kadesh, toward the brook flowing into the Great Sea. And this is the south side on the south. 
And the west side shall be the great sea from the southern boundary, as far as straight up to Chamath. This is the west side. 
And ye shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. 
And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves, and to the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, who shall have begotten children in the midst of you; and they shall be unto you as the native born among the children of Israel: with you shall they obtain an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. 
And it shall come to pass that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Eternal.
