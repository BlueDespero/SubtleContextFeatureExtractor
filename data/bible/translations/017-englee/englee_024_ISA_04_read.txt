Isaiah.
Chapter 4.
And seven women shall take hold of one man on that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take but away our reproach. 
On that day shall the sprout of the Lord be for ornament and for honor, and the fruit of the land for excellence and for glory for the escaped of Israel. 
And it shall come to pass, that whoever is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written down unto life in Jerusalem: 
When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have scoured away the blood-guiltiness of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction. 
And then will the Lord create upon every dwelling of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, a cloud and smoke by day, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering. 
And a tabernacle shall it be for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a covert from tempest and from rain.
