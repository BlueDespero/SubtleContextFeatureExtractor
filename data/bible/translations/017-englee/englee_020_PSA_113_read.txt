Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Hallelujah. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise ye the name of the Lord. 
Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore. 
From the rising of the sun unto his going down the name of the Lord is praised. 
High above all nations is the Lord, above the heavens is his glory. 
Who is like the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high? 
Who condescendeth to view what is done in the heavens, and on the earth? 
He raiseth up out of the dust the poor, from the dunghill he lifteth up the needy: 
That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 
He causeth the barren woman to dwell in the midst of her household, the joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.
