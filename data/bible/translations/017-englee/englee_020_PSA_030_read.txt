Psalms.
Chapter 30.
“A psalm, a song at the dedication of the temple, of David.” (30:2) I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me. 
(30:3) O Lord my God, I cried loudly unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 
(30:4) O Lord, thou hast brought up from the nether world my soul: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
(30:5) Sing unto the Lord, O ye his pious ones, and give thanks to the memorial of his holiness. 
(30:6) For his anger is momentary, but life is in his favor: in the evening cometh weeping to stay for a night, but in the morning, there is joyful song. 
(30:7) And I had said indeed in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 
(30:8) Lord, by thy favor hadst thou caused my mountain to stand in strength: thou didst hide thy face, and I was terrified. 
(30:9) Unto thee, O Lord, will I call; and unto the Lord will I make supplication. 
(30:10) What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the grave? Shall the dust thank thee? shall it announce thy truth? 
(30:11) Hear, O Lord, and be gracious unto me: Lord, be thou a helper unto me. 
(30:12) Thou hast changed my mourning into dancing for me; thou hast loosened my sack-cloth, and girded me with joy. 
(30:13) To the end that my glorious soul may sing praise to thee, and never be silent. O Lord my God, for ever will I give thanks unto thee.
