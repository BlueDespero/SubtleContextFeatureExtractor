Psalms.
Chapter 60.
“To the chief musician upon Shushan'eduth, a Michtham of David, to teach, (60:2) When he fought with Aram-naharayim, and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Salt Valley twelve thousand men.” (60:3) O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast made a breach in us, thou hast been displeased: restore now unto us thy favor. 
(60:4) Thou hast caused the earth to quake; thou hast split it: heal her breaches; for she is moved. 
(60:5) Thou hast caused thy people to see hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of confusion. 
(60:6) Thou hast given to those that fear thee a banner, to elevate themselves, because of the truth. Selah. 
(60:7) In order that thy beloved may be delivered: help with thy right hand, and answer me. 
(60:8) God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will I measure out. 
(60:9) Mine is Gil'ad, and mine is Menasseh; Ephraim also is the strong-hold of my head; of Judah are my chiefs; 
(60:10) Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou but over me. 
(60:11) Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will lead me as far as Edom? 
(60:12) Behold, it is thou, O God, who hast cast us off; and thou, O God, goest not forth with our armies. 
(60:13) Give us help against the assailant; for vain is the help of man. 
(60:14) Through God shall we do valiantly: and he it is that will tread down our assailants.
