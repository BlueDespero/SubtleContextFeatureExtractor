Job.
Chapter 40.
And the Lord addressed Job, and said, 
Will he that contendeth with the Almighty yet find fault? him that reproveth God answer this. 
Then answered Job the Lord, and said, 
Behold, I am too vile: what shall I answer thee? my hand do I place on my mouth. 
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will not repeat it again. 
Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the storm-wind, and said, 
Do but gird up like a mighty man thy loins: I will ask thee, and do thou inform me. 
Wilt thou indeed annul my decree? wilt thou condemn me, in order that thou mayest appear righteous? 
But if thou hast an arm like God, or if thou canst thunder loudly like him: 
Then do deck thyself with excellence and greatness, and clothe thyself in majesty and glory. 
Scatter abroad the ragings of thy wrath, and look on every proud one, and humble him. 
Look on every proud one, and bend him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 
Hide them in the dust altogether: bind up their faces in concealment. 
Then will I also myself praise thee, when thy own right hand hath helped thee. 
Only behold Behemoth, which I made near thee: grass he eateth like the ox. 
Only see, how great is his strength in his loins, and his force, in the muscles of his belly. 
He stretcheth out his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his loins are closely wrapped together. 
His bones are like pipes of brass: his frame is like bars of iron. 
He is the first in rank of the works of God: he that made him can alone bring his sword near unto him. 
But truly the mountains bear for him his food, and all the beasts of the field play there. 
Under shady trees he lieth down, in the covert of the reeds, and swamp. 
Shady trees cover him as his shadow: willows of the brook encompass him about. 
Behold, a river sweepeth violently along, but he hasteneth not away: he remaineth quiet, though a Jordan rusheth up to his mouth. 
Can one catch him before his eyes? pierce his nose by means of snares?—
