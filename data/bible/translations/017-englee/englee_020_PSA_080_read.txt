Psalms.
Chapter 80.
“To the chief musician upon Shoshannim; an 'Eduth by Assaph; a psalm.” (80:2) O Shepherd of Israel, give ear, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. 
(80:3) Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Menasseh awaken thy might, and come to our help. 
(80:4) O God, cause us to return, and let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved. 
(80:5) O Lord of hosts, how long shall thy anger smoke against the prayer of thy people? 
(80:6) Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 
(80:7) Thou renderest us a contest unto our neighbors: and our enemies hold derision among themselves. 
(80:8) O God of hosts, cause us to return, and let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved. 
(80:9) A vine didst thou remove out of Egypt: thou drovest out nations, and plantedst it. 
(80:10) Thou didst clear out a place before it, and it struck its root deeply, and it filled the land. 
(80:11) Mountains were covered with its shadow, and with its boughs the cedars of God. 
(80:12) It sent out its tendrils as far as the sea, and unto the river its suckers. 
(80:13) Wherefore hast thou now broken down its fences, so that all who pass by the way pluck the fruit from it? 
(80:14) The boar out of the forest doth gnaw at it, and what moveth on the field feedeth on it. 
(80:15) O God of hosts, return; I pray thee, look down from heaven, and behold, and think of this vine; 
(80:16) And of the sprout which thy right hand hath planted, and of the branch that thou hast made strong for thyself. 
(80:17) It is burnt with fire, it is hewn down; because of the rebuke of thy countenance do they perish. 
(80:18) Let thy hand be over the man of thy right hand, over the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself. 
(80:19) Then will we not swerve from thee: revive us again, and we will call on thy name. 
(80:20) O Lord God of hosts, cause us to return: let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved.
