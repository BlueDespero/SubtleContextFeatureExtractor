Isaiah.
Chapter 12.
And thou shalt say on that day, “I will thank thee, O Lord, that thou wast angry with me: thy anger now is turned away, and thou comfortest me. 
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust him; for my strength and song is Yah the Eternal: and he is become my salvation.” 
And ye shall draw water with gladness out of the springs of salvation. 
And ye shall say on that day, “Give thanks unto the Lord, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people, keep it in remembrance that exalted is his name. 
Sing unto the Lord; for he hath wrought a stupendous thing: known is this on all the earth.” 
Call aloud and shout, inhabitress of Zion; for great is in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel.
