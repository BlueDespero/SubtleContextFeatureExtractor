Exodus.
Chapter 11.
And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; after that he will let you go hence: when he doth let you go, he shall surely thrust you out altogether from here. 
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold. 
And the Lord gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people. 
And Moses said, Thus hath said the Lord, About midnight will I go out in the midst of Egypt: 
And there shall die every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that is to sit upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and every first-born of cattle. 
And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, the like of which hath never been, and the like of which will not be any more. 
But against any of the children of Israel not a dog shall move his tongue, neither against man nor beast; in order that ye may know how that the Lord doth distinguish between the Egyptians and Israel. 
And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow themselves down unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that followeth thee; and after that I will go out: and he went out from Pharaoh in a burning anger. 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; in order that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
