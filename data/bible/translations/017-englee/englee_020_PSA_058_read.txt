Psalms.
Chapter 58.
“To the chief musician Al-tashcheth, by David, a Michtham.” (58:2) Do you indeed, who are dumb, speak righteously? do ye judge in uprightness, O ye sons of men? 
(58:3) Even in your heart ye work injustice: on the earth do ye weigh out the violence of your hands. 
(58:4) The wicked are estranged from goodness from the womb: those who speak lies go astray from their very birth. 
(58:5) They have poison like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 
(58:6) Which will not hearken to the voice of conjurers, yea, that of the wisest of all charmers. 
(58:7) O God, break out their teeth in their mouth: the jaw-teeth of the young lions tear thou out, O Lord. 
(58:8) Let them melt away as water which runneth off: when each one bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as if cut in pieces. 
(58:9) As a snail which melteth, let him pass away; like the untimely birth of a woman which hath not seen the sun. 
(58:10) Before your pots can feel the thorns, will he take them away with a whirlwind, both the green and the burning. 
(58:11) The righteous will rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he will bathe his steps in the blood of the wicked. 
(58:12) So that a man shall say, Verily fruit will come for the righteous: verily there is a God that judgeth on the earth.
