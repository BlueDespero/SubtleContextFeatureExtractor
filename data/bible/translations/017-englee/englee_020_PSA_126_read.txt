Psalms.
Chapter 126.
“A song of the degrees.” When the Lord bringeth back again the captivity of Zion, then shall we be like dreamers. 
Then shall our mouth be filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then shall they say among the nations, Great things hath the Lord done for these. 
Great things would the Lord have done for us, whereat we should be joyful. 
Bring back again, O Lord, our captivity, like rivulets in arid land. 
Those that sow in tears shall reap with joyful song. 
He goeth forth indeed and weepeth, that beareth the seed for sowing; but he will surely come with joyful song when he beareth home his sheaves.
