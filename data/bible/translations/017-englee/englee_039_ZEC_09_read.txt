Zechariah.
Chapter 9.
The prophecy of the word of the Lord concerning the land of Chadrach, and Damascus his resting-place; for unto the Lord will look the eye of men, and that of all the tribes of Israel; 
And also concerning Chamath that is bordering thereon, Tyre, and Zidon, though it be very wise. 
And though Tyre have built herself a strong-hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets: 
Behold, the Lord will drive her out, and he will strike down her power into the sea; and she herself shall be devoured with fire. 
Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gazzah also, and tremble greatly: and 'Ekron, for her trust will be made ashamed: and the king shall vanish from Gazzah, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. 
And aliens shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
And I will remove their bloody -sacrifices out of their mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth; and their land also shall be left for our God, and it shall be as a prince's dwelling in Judah, and 'Ekron shall be like Jebusi. 
And I will encamp about my house against armies, against those that pass to and fro, and there shall not pass over them any more an oppressor; for now do I look on them with my eyes. 
Be greatly glad, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! behold, thy King will come unto thee, righteous and victorious is he, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of a she-ass. 
And I will cut off chariots from Ephraim, and horses from Jerusalem, and there shall be cut off the battle-bow, and he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. 
As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant, do I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein there is no water. 
Return you to the strong-hold, ye hopeful prisoners: even today do I declare, that I will recompense twofold good unto thee. 
For I do bend Judah for me, grasp Ephraim as a bow; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Javan, and I will render thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
And the Lord will appear over them, and then will go forth like the lightning his arrow: and the Lord Eternal will blow on the cornet, and he will go along in the tempests of the south. 
The Lord of hosts will be a shield over them; and they shall devour the prey, and subdue the sling-stones; and they shall drink, make a noise as one drunken with wine; and they shall be filled like the offering-bowls, like the corners of the altar. 
And the Lord their God will save them on that day as the flock of his people; for like the stones of a crown, will they elevate themselves over his land. 
For how great will be that generation's happiness, and how great its beauty! corn shall make the young men sing joyfully, and new wine the virgins.
