Psalms.
Chapter 108.
“A song or psalm of David.” (108:2) My heart is firm, O God; I will sing and give praise, even with my spirit. 
(108:3) Awake, psaltery and harp: I will wake up the morning-dawn. 
(108:4) I will give thee thanks among the people, O Lord: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
(108:5) For great above the heavens is thy kindness, and thy truth reacheth even unto the skies. 
(108:6) Exalt thyself above the heavens, O God; and above all the earth thy glory. 
(108:7) In order that thy beloved may be delivered: help with thy right hand, and answer me. 
(108:8) God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will I measure out. 
(108:9) Mine id Gil'ad, and mine is Menasseh; Ephraim also is the strong-hold of my head; of Judah are my chiefs. 
(108:10) Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 
(108:11) Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will lead me as far as Edom? 
(108:12) Behold, it is thou, O God, who hast cast us off; and thou, O God, goest not forth with our armies. 
(108:13) Give us help against the assailant; for vain is the help of man. 
(108:14) Through God shall we do valiantly; for he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
