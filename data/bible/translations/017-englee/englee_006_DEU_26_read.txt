Deuteronomy.
Chapter 26.
And it shall come to pass, when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and thou hast taken possession of it, and dwellest therein: 
That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the soil, which thou shalt bring in from thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket; and thou shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God will choose to let his name dwell there. 
And thou shalt come unto the priest that may be in those days, and thou shalt say unto him, I give thanks this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come into the land which the Lord swore unto our fathers to give to us. 
And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God. 
And thou shalt commence and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian, wandering about, was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a family few in number, and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and numerous. 
And the Egyptians treated us ill, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard labor; 
And then we cried unto the Eternal, the God of our fathers; and the Lord heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our trouble, and our oppression; 
And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror, and with signs, and with wonders; 
And he brought us unto this place, and gave unto us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the soil, which thou hast given me, O Lord; and thou shalt set it down before the Lord thy God, and prostrate thyself before the Lord thy God; 
And thou shalt rejoice with every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, with the Levite, and the stranger that is in the midst of thee. 
When thou hast made an end of giving away all the tithe of thy produce in the third year, the year of the tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, and they have eaten it within thy gates, and are satisfied: 
Then shalt thou say before the Lord thy God, I have removed away the hallowed things out of the house, and I have also given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me; I have not deviated from thy commandments, and I have not forgotten; 
I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I removed away aught thereof in an unclean state, nor have I given aught thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, I have done all, just as thou hast commanded me. 
Look down from the habitation of thy holiness, from the heavens, and bless thy people Israel, and the soil which thou hast given unto us, as thou hast sworn unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
This day the Lord thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances; and thou shalt keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. 
Thou hast this day acknowledged the Lord, that he is thy God, and that thou wilt walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice; 
And the Lord hath acknowledged thee this day, that thou art unto him a peculiar people, as he hath spoken unto thee, and that thou shouldst keep all his commandments; 
So that he may set thee highest above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.
