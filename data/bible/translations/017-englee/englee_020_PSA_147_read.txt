Psalms.
Chapter 147.
Hallelujah; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is comely; him becometh praise. 
The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem: the outcasts of Israel will he gather together; 
He that healeth the broken-hearted, and bindeth up their hurts; 
Who counteth the number of the stars; who calleth them all by their names. 
Great is our Lord, and abundant in power: his understanding is immeasurable. 
The Lord helpeth up the meek: he bringeth down the wicked to the ground. 
Lift up a song unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praises unto our God with the harp; 
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who causeth grass to grow upon the mountains; 
Who giveth to the beast its food, to the young ravens which cry. 
Not in the strength of the horse hath he delight: nor in the swiftness of the legs of man taketh he pleasure. 
The Lord taketh pleasure in those that fear him, that wait for his kindness. 
Glorify, O Jerusalem, the Lord: praise thy God, O Zion. 
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children in the midst of thee; 
He who bestoweth peace in thy borders, who satisfieth thee with the best of wheat; 
He who sendeth forth his decree unto the earth: how swiftly speedeth his word along! 
He who dispenseth snow like wool; who streweth about the hoarfrost like ashes; 
He who casteth down his ice like pieces: before his cold who can stand? 
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and waters run along. 
He declareth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances unto Israel. 
He hath not done so unto any nation: and his ordinances— these they know not. Hallelujah.
