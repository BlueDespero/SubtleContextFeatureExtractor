Psalms.
Chapter 3.
“A psalm of David, when he fled from before Abshalom his son.” (3:2) Lord, how numerous are my assailants! how many, that rise up against me! 
(3:3) Many say of my soul, There is no help for him with God. Selah. 
(3:4) But thou, O Lord, art a shield around me, my glory, and he that lifteth up my head. 
(3:5) With my voice I call unto the Lord, and he answereth me out of his holy mountain. Selah. 
(3:6) I laid myself down and slept: I awoke; for the Lord sustaineth me. 
(3:7) I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have placed themselves round about against me. 
(3:8) Arise, O Lord, help me, O my God; for thou smitest all my enemies upon the cheek bone: the teeth of the wicked dost thou break. 
(3:9) Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah.
