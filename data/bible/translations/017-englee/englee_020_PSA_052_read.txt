Psalms.
Chapter 52.
“To the chief musician, a Maskil of David, (52:2) When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Achimelech.” (52:3) What vauntest thou thyself of wickedness, O mighty man? the kindness of God endureth all the time. 
(52:4) Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs, like a sharpened razor, thou worker of deceit. 
(52:5) Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood more than speaking righteousness. Selah. 
(52:6) Thou lovest all words of destruction, the tongue of deceit. 
(52:7) Therefore God will also destroy thee for ever: he will take thee away, and pluck thee out of his tent, and root thee out of the land of life. Selah.— 
(52:8) And the righteous shall see it, and they will be afraid, and laugh concerning him: 
(52:9) “Lo, this is the man that made not God his fortress; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, relied proudly on his mischievous wickedness.” 
(52:10) But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the kindness of God for ever and ever. 
(52:11) I will thank thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for it is good, before thy pious ones.
