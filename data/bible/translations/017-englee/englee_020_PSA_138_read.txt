Psalms.
Chapter 138.
“By David.” I will praise thee with my whole heart: before thee, O God, will I sing praise unto thee. 
I will bow myself down before thy holy temple, and I will thank thy name for thy kindness and for thy truth; for thou hast magnified above all thy name thy promise. 
On the day when I called didst thou answer me, and raise me up with strength in my soul. 
All the kings of the earth will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, when they hear the promises of thy mouth. 
And they will sing on the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord. 
For exalted is the Lord, yet doth he regard the lowly; but the proud he punisheth from afar. 
If I should walk in the midst of distress, thou wilt revive me: against the wrath of my enemies wilt thou stretch forth thy hand, and thy right hand will save me. 
The Lord will accomplish all in my behalf; O Lord, thy kindness endureth for ever: the works of thy own hands do not abandon.
