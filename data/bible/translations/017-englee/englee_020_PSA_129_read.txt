Psalms.
Chapter 129.
“A song of the degrees.” Many a time have they assailed me from my youth, so should Israel say; 
Many a time have they assailed me from my youth: yet have they not prevailed against me. 
Upon my back have ploughmen ploughed; they have drawn long their furrows: 
Yet the Lord is righteous; he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
May all be put to shame and turned backward that hate Zion; 
May they become like the grass of the roofs, which withereth before it is pulled up; 
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor his arm he that bindeth sheaves. 
Nor do they who pass by say, The blessing of the Lord be with you: we bless you in the name of the Lord.
