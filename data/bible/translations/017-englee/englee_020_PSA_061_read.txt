Psalms.
Chapter 61.
“To the chief musician upon Neginah, by David.” (61:2) Hear, O God, my entreaty; listen to my prayer. 
(61:3) From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is too high for me. 
(61:4) For thou hast been a shelter unto me, a strong tower against the enemy. 
(61:5) Let me sojourn in thy tent to all eternity; let me be sheltered under the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
(61:6) For thou, O God, hast truly listened to my vows: thou hast given back the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
(61:7) Oh, add days unto the king's days: may his years be as of many generations. 
(61:8) May he abide for ever before God: ordain that kindness and truth may guard him. 
(61:9) So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may pay my vows day by day.
