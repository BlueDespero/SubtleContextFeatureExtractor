Isaiah.
Chapter 15.
The doom of Moab. Truly in a night is 'Ar of Moab plundered, it is laid waste; truly in a night is Kir of Moab plundered, it is laid waste. 
It goeth up to the idol-house, and Dibon goeth up to the high-places to weep, on Nebo and on Medeba shall Moab wail: on all its heads there is baldness, and every beard is hewn off. 
In its streets they are girded with sack-cloth, on its roofs, and in its public places every one shall wail, groan with weeping. 
And loud crieth Cheshbon with El'aleh; as far as Yahaz is heard their voice: therefore the armed men of Moab shall howl; its soul is grieved for itself. 
My heart will cry for Moab, whose fugitives are as far as Zo'ar, and the third 'Eglarth; for the ascent of Luchith—with weeping is it ascended; for on the way to Choronayim they let resound the cry of defeat in battle. 
For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for dry is the grass, gone are the herbs, and green things are no more. 
Therefore the rest of their acquisitions and what they possess shall they carry away over the brook of the willows. 
For the cry hath encompassed the boundary of Moab; up to Eglayim is heard its wail, and at Beer-elim is heard its wail. 
For the waters of Dimon are filled with blood; for I will bring over Dimon armed bands; over the escaped of Moab cometh a lion, and over the remnant of the land.
