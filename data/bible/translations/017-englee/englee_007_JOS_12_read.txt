And these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel smote, and whose land they took possession of on the other side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Chermon, and all the plain on the east: 
Sichon the king of the Emorites, who dwelt in Cheshbon, and ruled from 'Aro'er, which is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and over the land in the middle of the brook, and from half Gil'ad, even unto the brook Yabbok, the boundary of the children of 'Ammon; 
And over the plain up to the sea of Kinneroth on the east, and up to the sea of the plain, the salt sea on the east, on the way to Beth-hayeshimoth; and at the south, under the declivities of Pisgah; 
And the territory of 'Og the king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Rephaim, that dwelt at 'Ashtaroth and at Edre'i, 
And reigned over mount Chermon, and over Salchah, and over all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites, and half Gil'ad, to the boundary of Sichon the king of Cheshbon. 
These did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite; and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh.
