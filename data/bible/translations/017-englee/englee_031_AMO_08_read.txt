Amos.
Chapter 8.
Thus did the Lord Eternal show unto me: and, behold, there was a basket of summer fruit. 
And he said, What dost thou see, 'Amos? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, The end is come for my people Israel: I will not farther indulge them any more. 
And the songs of the temple shall become a wailing on that day, saith the Lord Eternal: many shall be the dead bodies; in every place shall men throw them down, saying, Be silent. 
Hear this, O ye that are greedy to swallow the needy, and to ruin the poor of the land, 
Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell provision? and the sabbath, that we may open the corn-warehouses, making the ephah small, and increasing the shekel, and cheating with deceitful balances? 
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; and even sell the refuse of the corn? 
Sworn hath the Lord by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will not forget to eternity all their works. 
Shall because of this the land not tremble, and mourn every one that dwelleth therein? and shall it not rise up like a stream wholly, and roll onward and sink again like the stream of Egypt? 
And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord Eternal, that I will cause the sun to set at noon, and I will bring darkness over the earth on a bright day; 
And I will change your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations; and I will bring upon all loins sackcloth, and upon every head baldness; and I will cause the land to mourn as one doth for an only son, and its end to be as a day of bitter complaint. 
Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord Eternal, when I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water, but to hear the words of the Lord: 
And they will wander about from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they will roam about to seek the word of the Lord; but they shall not find it. 
On that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst; 
Those that swear by the guilt of Samaria, and say, As thy god liveth, O Dan; and, As liveth the worshipped idol of Beer-sheba',—yea, they shall fall, and never rise up again.
