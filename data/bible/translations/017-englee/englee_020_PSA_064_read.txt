Psalms.
Chapter 64.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (64:2) Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: preserve my life from the dread of the enemy. 
(64:3) Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, from the tumultuous assault of the workers of wickedness; 
(64:4) Who whet their tongue like a sword, who aim with their arrow, the bitter word: 
(64:5) To shoot in secret at the innocent; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
(64:6) They encourage themselves in an evil plan; they tell secretly of laying snares: they say, Who will see them? 
(64:7) They search out iniquities; “We are ready with the carefully searched out device:” and the inward thought and heart of each is deeply hidden. 
(64:8) But God shooteth at them suddenly his arrow;—thence are come their wounds. 
(64:9) And their own tongues will stumble over themselves: all that look on them will shake their head. 
(64:10) All men shall fear, and shall declare the deeds of God, and understand his works. 
(64:11) The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glorify themselves.
