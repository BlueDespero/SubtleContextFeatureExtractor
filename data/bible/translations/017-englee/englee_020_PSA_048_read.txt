Psalms.
Chapter 48.
“A song and psalm by the sons of Korach.” (48:2) Great is the Lord, and highly praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 
(48:3) A beautiful district, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, the farthest north, the city of the great King. 
(48:4) God is become known in her palaces as a defence. 
(48:5) For, lo, the kings were assembled, they are passed away together. 
(48:6) They indeed saw—and so they were astonished; they were terrified, they were confounded. 
(48:7) Trembling seized on them there, pain, as on a woman in travail. 
(48:8) With the east wind thou breakest the ships of Tharshish. 
(48:9) As we have heard, so have we seen it in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 
(48:10) We have reflected on thy kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 
(48:11) As thy name is, O God, so is thy praise over the ends of the earth: of righteousness is thy right hand full. 
(48:12) Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
(48:13) Compass Zion about, and walk round about her; number her towers. 
(48:14) Direct your mind to her outer wall, mark carefully her palaces: in order that ye may tell it to the latest generation. 
(48:15) For this One is God, our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
