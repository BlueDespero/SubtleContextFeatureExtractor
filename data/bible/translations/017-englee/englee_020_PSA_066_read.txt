Psalms.
Chapter 66.
“To the chief musician, a song or psalm.” Shout joyfully unto God, all ye lands: 
Sing forth the glory of his name; make glorious his praise. 
Say unto God, How fear-inspiring is every one of thy works! through the greatness of thy strength will thy enemies yield feigned obedience unto thee. 
All the lands shall bow themselves down unto thee, and shall sing praises unto thee; they shall sing praises to thy name. Selah. 
Come and see the deeds of God: fear-inspiring is his doing toward the children of men. 
He changed the sea into dry land: through the river they went on foot: there did we rejoice in him. 
He ruleth by his might for ever; his eyes look upon the nations: the rebellious—these shall not be exalted. Selah. 
Bless, O ye people, our God, and cause the voice of his praise to be heard: 
Who hath appointed our soul to life, and hath not suffered our foot to slip. 
For thou hast proved us, O God: thou hast refined us, as silver is refined. 
Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast placed fetters upon our loins. 
Thou hast caused men to ride on our head: we entered into fire and into water; but thou broughtest us out to the enjoyment of overflowing plenty. a 
I will enter thy house with burnt-offerings: I will pay unto thee my vows, 
Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress. 
Burnt-offerings of fatlings will I offer up unto thee, with the incense of rams; I will prepare steers with he-goats. Selah. 
Come, hear, and I will relate, all ye that fear God, what he hath done for my soul. 
Unto him I cried with my mouth, and a song of extolling was on my tongue. 
If I had looked on wickedness with my heart, the Lord would not have heard; 
But verily God hath heard; he hath listened to the voice of my prayer. 
Blessed be God, who hath not removed my prayer from him, nor his kindness from me.
