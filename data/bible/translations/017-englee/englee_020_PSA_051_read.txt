Psalms.
Chapter 51.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David, (51:2) When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in unto Bath-sheba'.” (51:3) Be gracious unto me, O God, according to thy kindness: according to the greatness of thy mercies blot out my transgressions. 
(51:4) Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
(51:5) For of my transgressions I have full knowledge; and my sin is before me continually. 
(51:6) To thee, thee only, have I sinned, and what is evil in thy eyes have I done:—in order that thou mightest be righteous when thou speakest, be justified when thou judgest. 
(51:7) Behold, in iniquity was I brought forth; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
(51:8) Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: therefore do thou cause me to know wisdom in the recesses of the heart. 
(51:9) Cleanse me from sin with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
(51:10) Cause me to hear gladness and joy; that the bones which thou hast crushed may rejoice. 
(51:11) Hide thy face from my sins, and all my iniquities do thou blot out. 
(51:12) Create unto me a clean heart, O God; and a firm spirit renew thou within me. 
(51:13) Cast me not away from thy presence; and thy holy spirit do not take from me. 
(51:14) Restore unto me the gladness of thy salvation; and with a liberal spirit do thou support me.— 
(51:15) I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall return unto thee. 
(51:16) Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; that my tongue may sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
(51:17) O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
(51:18) For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: in burnt-offering hast thou no delight. 
(51:19) The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, wilt thou not despise. 
(51:20) Do good in thy favor unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
(51:21) Then wilt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and entire offering: then shall bullocks be offered upon thy altar.
