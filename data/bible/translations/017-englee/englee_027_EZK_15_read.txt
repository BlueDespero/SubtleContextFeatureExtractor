Ezekiel.
Chapter 15.
And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, What shall become of the wood of the vine more than of any other wood, of the branch which was standing among the trees of the forest? 
Can wood be taken therefrom to employ it for any work? or will men take from it a pin to hang thereon any vessel? 
Behold, if it be given up to the fire to be consumed,—and the fire have consumed both its ends, and the middle of it be scorched; will it be fit for any work? 
Behold, when it was yet entire, it could not be employed for any work: how much more must this be when the fire hath consumed it, and it is scorched,—and shall it yet be employed for any work? 
Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed: so do I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
And I will set my face against them: from the fire have they gone forth, yet the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them. 
And I will render the land a desert; because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Eternal.
