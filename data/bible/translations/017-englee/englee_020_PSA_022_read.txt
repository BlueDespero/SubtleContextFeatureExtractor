Psalms.
Chapter 22.
“To the chief musician upon Ayeleth-hashachar, a psalm of David.” (22:2) My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from saving me, and from the words of my loud complaint? 
(22:3) O my God! I call in the day-time, but thou answerest not; and in the night I find no rest. 
(22:4) But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amidst the praises of Israel. 
(22:5) In thee did our fathers trust: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
(22:6) Unto thee they cried, and were delivered: in thee they trusted, and were not put to shame. 
(22:7) But I am a worm, and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of people. 
(22:8) All those who see me laugh me to scorn: they draw open their lips, they shake their head, saying, 
(22:9) “Let him throw himself on the Lord, that he may deliver him: he will save him, for he delighteth in him.” 
(22:10) Yea, thou art he that took me from the womb: thou hast been my trust when I hung on my mother's breasts. 
(22:11) Upon thee was I cast from my birth: from my mother's womb art thou my God. 
(22:12) Oh be not far from me now; for distress is near; for there is none to help. 
(22:13) Many steers have encompassed me: the strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 
(22:14) They have opened wide against me their mouth, as a ravenous and roaring lion. 
(22:15) Like water am I poured out, and all my bones are disjointed: my heart is become like wax, it is melted in the midst of my entrails. 
(22:16) Like a potsherd is my strength dried up; and my tongue cleaveth to my palate; and into the dust of death hast thou laid me down. 
(22:17) For dogs have encompassed me; the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: like lions they threaten my hands and my feet. 
(22:18) I may number all my bones: while they stare and look upon me. 
(22:19) They divide my clothes among themselves, and for my garment do they cast lots. 
(22:20) But thou, O Lord, be not far from me: O thou who art my strength, hasten to my aid. 
(22:21) Deliver from the sword my life, from the power of the dog my solitary soul. 
(22:22) Save me from the lion's mouth; as thou hast answered me from the horns of the reem. 
(22:23) I will relate thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. 
(22:24) Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and be in dread of him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
(22:25) For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the poor; neither hath he hidden his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. 
(22:26) Of thee shall be my praise in a great assembly: my vows will I pay in the presence of those who fear him. 
(22:27) The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they who seek him shall praise the Lord: may your heart live for ever. 
(22:28) All the ends of the world shall remember and return unto the Lord: and all the families of the nations shall bow themselves down before thee. 
(22:29) For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he governeth the nations. 
(22:30) All they that eat the fat of the earth shall bow themselves down; before him shall bend the knee all that are going down into the dust; for none can keep alive his own soul. 
(22:31) Distant ages shall serve him; there shall be related of the Lord unto future generations. 
(22:32) They will come, and will tell his righteousness unto a people yet unborn, that he hath done this.
