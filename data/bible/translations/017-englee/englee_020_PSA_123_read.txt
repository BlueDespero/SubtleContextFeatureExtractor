Psalms.
Chapter 123.
“A song of the degrees.” Unto thee do I lift up my eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: thus are our eyes directed unto the Lord our God, until he be gracious unto us. 
Be gracious unto us, O Lord! be gracious unto us; for we are overburdened with contempt. 
Our soul is overburdened with the scorn of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud oppressors.
