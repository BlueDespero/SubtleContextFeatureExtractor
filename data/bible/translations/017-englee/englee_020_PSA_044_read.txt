Psalms.
Chapter 44.
“To the chief musician, for the sons of Korach, a Maskil.” (44:2) O God, with our ears have we heard, our fathers have told us, deeds which thou hadst done in their days, in times of old. 
(44:3) Thou, with thy hand, didst indeed drive out nations, and plant them; thou didst ill-treat people, and cause them to spread out. 
(44:4) For not by their sword did they obtain possession of the land, and their own arm brought them no victory; but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst given them thy favor. 
(44:5) Thou art my King, O God: ordain salvation for Jacob. 
(44:6) Through thee will we butt down our assailants: through thy name will we tread under foot our opponents. 
(44:7) For not in my bow will I trust, and my sword shall not help me. 
(44:8) But thou helpest us against our assailants, and those that hate us thou puttest to shame. 
(44:9) Of God we boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. Selah. 
(44:10) But now thou hast cast off, and put us to the blush, and goest not forth with our armies. 
(44:11) Thou causest us to turn back from before our assailant: and they who hate us take spoil for themselves. 
(44:12) Thou givest us up like sheep for food, and among the nations hast thou dispersed us. 
(44:13) Thou sellest thy people for no value, and acquirest no gain by their price. 
(44:14) Thou renderest us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and a derision to those that are round about us. 
(44:15) Thou renderest us a by-word among the nations, a shaking of the head among the people. 
(44:16) All the day is my disgrace before me, and the shame of my face covereth me; 
(44:17) Because of the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and him that seeketh vengeance. 
(44:18) All this is come over us, yet have we not forgotten thee; nor have we dealt falsely by thy covenant; 
(44:19) Our heart is not moved backward, nor hath our step turned aside from thy path: 
(44:20) Even when thou didst crush us in the abode of monsters, and cover us with the shadow of death. 
(44:21) If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange God: 
(44:22) Would not God search out this? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
(44:23) But for thy sake are we slain all the day; we are counted as flocks destined for slaughter. 
(44:24) Awake, wherefore wilt thou sleep, O Lord? arise, abandon us not for ever. 
(44:25) Wherefore wilt thou hide thy face, wilt thou forget our misery, and our oppression? 
(44:26) For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body cleaveth unto the earth. 
(44:27) Arise unto our help, and redeem us for the sake of thy kindness.
