Hosea.
Chapter 8.
Set the cornet to thy mouth. Let the enemy come like the eagle against the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and against my law have they trespassed. 
To me will they then cry, My God, we, Israel, know thee. 
But Israel did reject the good; so let the enemy pursue him. 
They set up kings, but not my advice: they chose princes and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made themselves idols so that they will be cut off. 
Thy calf, O Samaria, hath caused thy rejection; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be that they cannot cleanse themselves? 
For whom Israel did also that idol spring; an artisan made it, and no God is it: so then shall it become broken in splinters— that calf of Samaria. 
For the wind do they sow, and the whirlwind shall they reap: their seed bringeth no standing corn; the plant yieldeth no meal; but should it yield it, strangers would swallow it up. 
Swallowed up is Israel: now are they among the nations as a vessel without any value. 
For they are needs gone up to Assyria, they who like a wild ass should dwell alone: Ephraim spendeth lovers' gifts. 
But even though they should spend gifts among the nations, now will I gather them: and they shall be humbled a little through the burden of the king of princes. 
Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, the altars have been unto him the means of sinning. 
I ever wrote down for him the great things of my law; but as a strange thing are they accounted. 
My sacrificial offerings they slay as common flesh that they may eat it; the Lord accepteth them not in favor: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall indeed return to Egypt. 
For Israel forgot his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire among his cities, and it shall devour their fine edifices.
