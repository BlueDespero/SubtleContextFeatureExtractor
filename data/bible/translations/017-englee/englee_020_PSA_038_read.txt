Psalms.
Chapter 38.
“A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.” (38:2) O Lord, correct me not in thy wrath, nor chastise me in thy fury. 
(38:3) For thy arrows have penetrated into me, and thy hand presseth down upon me. 
(38:4) There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy indignation: there is no peace in my bones because of my sin. 
(38:5) For my iniquities are passed over my head, as a heavy burden are they too heavy for me. 
(38:6) Foul, corrupt are my bruises because of my folly. 
(38:7) I am bent double; I am bowed down to the utmost; all the day long I go about full of grief. 
(38:8) For my loins are filled with a burning disease, and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
(38:9) I am made faint and crushed to the utmost; I cry aloud because of the groaning of my heart. 
(38:10) Lord, before thee is all my longing; and my sighing is from thee not hidden. 
(38:11) My heart is restless, my strength hath left me; and the light of my eyes—that also is no more with me. 
(38:12) My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
(38:13) They also that seek after my life lay snares; and they that wish for my mishap speak wicked falsehoods; and deceits do they devise all the day long. 
(38:14) But I, as a deaf man, hear not; and I am as a dumb man that cannot open his mouth. 
(38:15) Thus am I as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no words of defence. 
(38:16) For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 
(38:17) For I said, Perhaps they might rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they might magnify themselves over me. 
(38:18) For I am prepared for my downfall, and my pain is continually before me. 
(38:19) For I will tell of my iniquity; I will be grieved because of my sin. 
(38:20) But my enemies are strong in life; and numerous are those that hate me wrongfully; 
(38:21) They also that repay me evil in lieu of good; they hate me bitterly because I pursue what is good. 
(38:22) Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me. 
(38:23) Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
