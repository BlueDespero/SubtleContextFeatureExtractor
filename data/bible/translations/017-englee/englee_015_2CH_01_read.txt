The Second Book of the Chronicles.
Chapter 1.
And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and caused him to become exceedingly great. 
Then said Solomon unto all Israel, to the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the chiefs of the family divisions that they should go with him. 
Thereupon went Solomon, and all the assembly with him, to the high-place that was at Gib'on; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness. 
Nevertheless the ark of God had David brought up from Kiryath-ye'arim to the place which David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
But the copper altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, had made, he placed before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the assembly sought for it. 
And Solomon sacrificed there on the copper altar before the Lord, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered upon it a thousand burnt-offerings. 
In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. 
And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shown unto David my father great kindness, and hast made me king in his stead. 
Now, O Lord God, let thy word unto David my father be verified; for thou hast made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who could otherwise judge this thy great people? 
And God said unto Solomon, Whereas this hath been in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, and hast not even asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 
Therefore are the wisdom and the knowledge granted unto thee; and riches, and wealth, and honor, will I give thee, such as no kings that have been before thee have had, and the like of which after thee none shall have. 
Then came Solomon from the high-place that was at Gib'on to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. 
And Solomon brought together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
And the king rendered the silver and gold at Jerusalem like stones, and cedar-trees he rendered as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowlands for abundance. 
And Solomon had his horses brought out of Egypt; a company of the king's merchants bought a quantity at a price. 
And they brought up, and fetched out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
