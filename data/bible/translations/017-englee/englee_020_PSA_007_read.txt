Psalms.
Chapter 7.
“A Shiggayon of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the affairs of Cush the Benjamite.” (7:2) O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust; save me from every one of my persecutors, and deliver me: 
(7:3) Lest he tear like a lion my soul, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver. 
(7:4) O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be injustice in my hands; 
(7:5) If I have recompensed him that was at peace with me with evil; If I have taken aught from my assailants without cause: 
(7:6) May the enemy hotly pursue my soul, and overtake it; and tread down upon the earth my life, and cause my honor to be in the dust. Selah. 
(7:7) Arise, O Lord, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. 
(7:8) So shall the congregation of nations compass thee about: and for their sakes return thou to the height. 
(7:9) The Lord will judge the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity grant me recompense. 
(7:10) Oh let the evil of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just, O thou, who triest the hearts and reins, O righteous God. 
(7:11) My protection is by God, who saveth the upright in heath. 
(7:12) God is a righteous judge, and a God who is indignant with the wicked every day. 
(7:13) If he turn not, He will whet his sword, he bendeth his bow, and maketh it ready. 
(7:14) Also for him he prepareth the instruments of death; he fashioneth his arrows against the persecutors. 
(7:15) Behold, he travaileth with wrong doing; but he hath conceived mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood. 
(7:16) He hath hollowed out a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he hath wrought. 
(7:17) His mischief will return upon his own head, and upon his own skull will his violence come down. 
(7:18) I will thank the Lord according to his righteousness; and I will sing praises to the name of the Lord the Most High.
