Psalms.
Chapter 53.
“To the chief musician upon Machalath, a Maskil of David.” (53:2) The worthless fool saith in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and they are abominable in their injustice: there is none that doth good. 
(53:3) God looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be one intelligent, one who seeketh for God. 
(53:4) Every one of them hath departed from righteousness; altogether are they become corrupt: there is none that doth good, no, not one. 
(53:5) Is there no knowledge in the workers of wickedness? who eat up my people as they eat bread: while they do not call on God. 
(53:6) There were they terrified with terror where there was no terror; for God had scattered the bones of those that encamped against thee: thou didst put them to shame, because God had rejected them. 
(53:7) Oh that some one might bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, then will Jacob be glad, and Israel will rejoice.
