Psalms.
Chapter 87.
“By the sons of Korach; a psalm or song.” It is founded by him on holy mountains. 
The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as those that know me; behold, here is Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: “This man was born there.” 
But of Zion will it be said, “This and that man were born in her:” and the Most High himself doth establish her. 
The Lord will number when he writeth down nations. “This man was born there.” Selah. 
And the singers as well as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs of joy are in thee.
