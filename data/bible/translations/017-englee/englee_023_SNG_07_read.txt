Song of Solomon.
Chapter 7.
(7:2) How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince's daughter! the roundings of thy thighs are like jewelled ornaments, the work of the hands of the artificer. 
(7:3) Thy navel is like a round goblet which lacketh not the mixed wine: thy body is like a heap of wheat fenced about with lilies. 
(7:4) Thy two breasts are like two fawns, the twins of the roe. 
(7:5) Thy neck is like a tower of ivory; thy eyes are like the pools in Cheshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. 
(7:6) Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple: a king is held bound in the tresses. 
(7:7) How beautiful and how pleasant art thou, O love, in thy attractions! 
(7:8) This thy stature is like a palm-tree, and thy breasts are like clusters of grapes. 
(7:9) I thought, I wish to climb up the palm-tree, I wish to take hold of its boughs; and, oh, that thy breasts might be like clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 
(7:10) And thy palate like the best wine, that glideth down for my friend gently, exciting the lips of those that are asleep.— 
(7:11) I am my friend's, and toward me is his desire. 
(7:12) Come, my friend, let us go forth into the field; let us spend the night in the villages; 
(7:13) Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine have blossomed, whether the young grape have opened to the view, whether the pomegranates have budded: there will I give my caresses unto thee. 
(7:14) The mandrakes give forth their smell, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and also old: O my friend, these have I laid up for thee.
