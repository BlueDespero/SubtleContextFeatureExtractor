Chapter 2.
Upon my watch will I stand, and place myself upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer to my reproof. 
And the Lord answered me, and said, Write down the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that everyone may read it fluently. 
For there is yet a vision for the appointed time, and it speaketh of the end, and it will not deceive: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not be delayed. 
Behold, disturbed, not at rest is the soul of the wicked in him; but the righteous ever liveth in his trustful faith. 
And though the wine-drunken traitor, the proud man, whose house will not stand, who enlargeth his desire as the grave, and is like death, which cannot be satisfied,—though he gather unto him all the nations, and assemble unto him all the people: 
Will not all these take up a parable against him, and a proverb and a satire concerning him? and they will say, Woe to him that increaseth what is not his! for how long? and to him that loadeth himself with a burden of guilt! 
Behold, suddenly will rise up those that afflict thee, and awake those that plague thee, and thou shalt become a booty unto them. 
Because thou hast despoiled many nations will all the remnant of the people despoil thee; because of the blood of men, and the violence against the land, the town, and all that dwell therein. 
Woe to him that obtaineth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the grasp of the wicked! 
Thou hast counselled shame to thy house, by cutting off many people, and sinning against thy soul. 
For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the wood -work will answer it. 
Woe to him that buildeth a city with blood-guiltiness, and layeth the foundation of a town by wrong-doing. 
Behold, is it not from the Lord of hosts that people shall labor for the very fire, and nations shall weary themselves for naught but vanity! 
For the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. 
Woe unto him that maketh his neighbors drink, to thee that pourest out thy poisonous wine, and makest them also drunken, in order to look on their nakedness! 
Thou art filled with shame instead of glory; drink thou also, and let thy nakedness be uncovered: there shall be turned around thee the cup of the Lord's right hand, and filthy spittle shall be on thy glory. 
For the violence against Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of beasts, which he terrified away; because of the blood of men, and the violence against the land, the town, and all that dwell therein. 
What profiteth the graven image that its maker hath graven it? the molten image, and a teacher of falsehood? that the maker of his image trusteth therein, while making dumb idols? 
Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake! Rouse up to the dumb stone. Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and no breath whatever is in its bosom. 
But the Lord is in his holy temple: be silent before him all the earth.
