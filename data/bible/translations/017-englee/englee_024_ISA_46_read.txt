Isaiah.
Chapter 46.
Bel is bowed down, Nebo sinketh, their idols are delivered unto the beasts, and unto the cattle; those which were once carried by you are now laden up a burden to the weary beasts. 
They are sunk, they are bowed down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves are gone into captivity. 
Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who are borne by me from their birth, who are carried from the womb; 
And even unto old age I am the same; and even unto the time of hoary hairs will I bear: l have done it, and I will carry you; even I will bear, and deliver you. 
To whom will ye liken and assimilate me, and compare me, that we may be like? 
There are those that lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; that hire a melter, that he may make of it a god; they then bend the knee, yea, they bow themselves down; 
They carry him, upon the shoulder they bear him, and set up him in his spot, and he remaineth standing, from his place he doth not move: yea, though one should cry unto him, he cannot answer, out of his trouble he cannot help him. 
Remember this, and take courage: take it again to heart, O ye transgressors. 
Remember the former things of olden times; for I am God, and there is no one else; I am God, and there is nothing like me. 
Declaring from the beginning the end, and from the earliest days the things that have not yet been done, saying, My counsel shall stand firm, and all my pleasure will I do: 
Calling from the east the eagle, from a far-off country the man of my counsel; yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also execute it. 
Hearken unto me, ye stout of heart, that are far from righteousness: 
I have brought near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will grant unto Zion salvation, unto Israel my glory.
