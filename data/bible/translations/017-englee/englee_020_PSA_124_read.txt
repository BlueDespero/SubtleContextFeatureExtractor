Psalms.
Chapter 124.
“A song of the degrees by David.” If it had not been the Lord who was for us, so should Israel say; 
If it had not been the Lord who was for us, when men rose up against us: 
Then would they have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; 
Then would the waters have overwhelmed us, the stream would have passed over our soul; 
Then would have passed over our soul the presumptuous waters. 
Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us up as a prey to their teeth. 
Our soul is escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
