Psalms.
Chapter 114.
When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language: 
Judah became his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 
The sea beheld it, and fled: the Jordan was driven backward. 
The mountains skipped like wethers, the hills like lambs. 
What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleest? thou, O Jordan, that thou art driven backward? 
Ye mountains, that ye skip like wethers? ye hills, like lambs? 
At the presence of the Lord tremble, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
Who changeth the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of water.
