Psalms.
Chapter 49.
“To the chief musician, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” (49:2) Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the perishable world: 
(49:3) Both the sons of the low and the sons of the high, rich and needy, altogether. 
(49:4) My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. 
(49:5) I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open with the harp my riddle. 
(49:6) Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my oppressors encompasseth me?— 
(49:7) Of those that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves of the multitude of their riches? 
(49:8) No one can in any wise redeem his brother, nor can he give to God redemption money for himself; 
(49:9) For the ransom of their soul is too costly, and it is omitted for ever. 
(49:10) And should he still live for ever? not see the pit? 
(49:11) For he must see that wise men die, that together the fool and the brutish person perish and leave to others their wealth. 
(49:12) Their inward thought is, that their houses are to be for ever, their dwelling-places, from generation to generation; they call them by their own names in various countries. 
(49:13) Nevertheless man in his splendor endureth not: he is like the beasts that perish. 
(49:14) This is their way, their folly: yet their posterity will take pleasure in their sayings. Selah. 
(49:15) Like flocks are they thrust into the nether world; death will feed them; but the upright shall have dominion over them in that morning, and their form wasteth away in the nether world, taken away from their own dwelling. 
(49:16) But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether world; for he will take me away. Selah. 
(49:17) Be not thou afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 
(49:18) For when he dieth he can take nothing away; his glory will not descend after him. 
(49:19) For though he bless his soul during his life, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself: 
(49:20) She shall go to the generation of his fathers, unto eternity will these never see light. 
(49:21) Man, though in splendor, who understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. °
