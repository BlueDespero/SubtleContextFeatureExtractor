The First Book of Moses, called Genesis.
Chapter 1.
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God was waving over the face of the waters. 
And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. 
And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness. 
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it was evening and it was morning, the first day. 
And God said, Let there be an expansion in the midst of the waters, and let it divide between waters and waters. 
And God made the expansion, and divided between the waters which were under the expansion and the waters which were above the expansion: and it was so. 
And God called the expansion Heaven. And it was evening and it was morning, the second day. 
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land be visible: and it was so. 
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, herbs yielding seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, in which its seed is upon the earth: and it was so. 
And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees yielding fruit, in which its seed is after their kind: and God saw that it was good. 
And it was evening and it was morning, the third day. 
And God said, Let there be lights in the expansion of the heaven to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years; 
And let them be for lights in the expansion of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars. 
And God set them in the expansion of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
And to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 
And it was evening and it was morning, the fourth day. 
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open expansion of the heaven. 
And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind: and God saw that it was good. 
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply on the earth. 
And it was evening and it was morning, the fifth day. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so. 
And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind: and God saw that it was good. 
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and they shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
And God created man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 
And God said, Behold I have given unto you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree on which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food. 
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heaven, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so. 
And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.
