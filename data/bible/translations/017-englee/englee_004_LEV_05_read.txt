Leviticus.
Chapter 5.
And if any person sin, because he heareth the voice of adjuration, and he is a witness, since he hath either seen or knoweth something; if he do not tell it, and thus bear his iniquity; 
Or if there be a person who toucheth any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of an unclean creeping thing, and it escape his recollection; but he becometh aware that he is unclean, and hath thus incurred guilt; 
Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness of the kind it be by which he can be defiled, and it escape his recollection; but he becometh aware of it, and that he hath thus incurred guilt; 
Or if any person swear, by pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good to himself, in whatsoever it be that a man pronounceth with an oath, and it escape his recollection; but he becometh aware of it that he hath incurred guilt by any one of these: 
And it shall be, if he have incurred guilt by any one of these things, that he shall confess that concerning which he hath sinned; 
And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath committed, a female from the flocks, a sheep or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin. 
And if his means be not sufficient for a sheep, then shall he bring as his offering for the trespass which he hath committed, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering. 
And he shall bring them unto the priest, and he shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head by the back of its neck, but shall not divide it asunder: 
And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin-offering upon the wall of the altar: and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; it is a sin-offering. 
And the second shall he prepare as a burnt-offering, according to the prescribed order; and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
But if his means be not sufficient for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then shall he bring as his offering for that which he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall not put upon it any oil, nor shall he put thereupon any frankincense; for it is a sin-offering. 
And he shall bring it to the priest; and the priest shall take from it his handful, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, upon the fire-offerings of the Lord: it is a sin-offering. 
And the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin that he hath committed in one of these, and it shall be forgiven unto him; and it shall belong to the priest, as the meat-offering. 
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
If any person commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, against the holy things of the Lord: then shall he bring as his trespass-offering unto the Lord a ram without blemish out of the flocks, in value of two shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering. 
And that, in which he hath sinned against the holy thing, shall he pay, and shall add its fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
And if any person sin, and commit any one of the prohibitions of the Lord which ought not to be done; and he know not whether he have incurred guilt, and so bear his iniquity: 
Then shall he bring a ram without blemish out of the flocks, of the usual value, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin of ignorance, wherein he hath erred and knoweth it not, and it shall be forgiven unto him. 
It is a trespass-offering: he hath in trespassing trespassed against the Lord.
