Psalms.
Chapter 62.
“To the chief musician, upon Jeduthun, a psalm of David.” (62:2) Only in God my soul trusted in silence: from him cometh my salvation. 
(62:3) Only he is my rock and my salvation; he is my defense: I shall not be greatly moved. 
(62:4) How long will ye devise mischief against a man? will ye all assault him murderously, as though he were a falling wall, a tottering fence? 
(62:5) Yea, from his height do they take counsel to cast him down; they delight in lies: with their mouth do they bless, but inwardly do they curse. Selah. 
(62:6) Yea, in God hope in silence, my soul; for from him is my expectation. 
(62:7) Only he is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence: I shall not be moved. 
(62:8) With God are my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength and my protection are in God. 
(62:9) Trust in him at all times, O ye people; pour out before him your heart: God is a protection for us. Selah. 
(62:10) Verily nought are the sons of common men, a lie the sons of the great; they must rise in the balance; they are altogether lighter than nought. 
(62:11) Do not put your trust in defrauding, and be not rendered vain through robbery: if riches flourish, set not your heart upon them. 
(62:12) Once hath God spoken; yea, twice what I have heard: that strength belongeth unto God. 
(62:13) And unto thee, O Lord, belongeth kindness; for thou wilt recompense every man according to his works.
