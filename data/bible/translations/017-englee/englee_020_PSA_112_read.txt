Psalms.
Chapter 112.
Hallelujah. Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that greatly delighteth in his commandments. 
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 
Plenty and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness shall endure for ever. 
There ariseth in the darkness a light to the upright: he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous. 
Well will it be with the man who is kind, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with justice. 
Surely unto eternity shall he not be moved: in everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be held. 
Of an evil report shall he not be afraid: his heart is firm, trusting in the Lord. 
Well supported is his heart, he shall not be afraid, until he looketh on the punishment of his assailants. 
He distributeth, he giveth to the needy: his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted in honor. 
The wicked shall see it, and be vexed; he will gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the longing of the wicked shall perish.
