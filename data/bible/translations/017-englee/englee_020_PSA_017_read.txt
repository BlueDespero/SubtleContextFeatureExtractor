Psalms.
Chapter 17.
“A prayer of David.” Hear, O Lord, the cause of righteousness, attend unto my entreaty, give ear unto my prayer, coming from lips without deceit. 
Let from thy presence my sentence come forth; let thy eyes behold what is right. 
Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast thought of me in the night; thou hast refined me—thou couldst find nothing: my purpose doth not pass beyond the words of my mouth. 
Among the deeds of men did I observe, by the word of thy lips, the paths of the dissolute. 
My steps held firmly to thy tracks, and my footsteps did not slip. 
I call on thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thy ear unto me, hear my speech. 
Show marvelously thy loving-kindnesses, O thou that savest those who put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them by thy right hand. 
Keep me as the apple of the eye; conceal me under the shadow of thy wings, 
From the wicked that despoil me, my enemies, who, to take my life, compass me about. 
They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 
On our steps they now encompass us: they direct their eyes to turn aside in the land. 
Every man is just like a lion that is greedy to tear his prey, and like a young lion lurking in a covert. 
Arise, O Lord, prevent him, cast him down; deliver my soul from the wicked, who is thy sword,— 
From these men—thy hand—O Lord, from the men of this world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hidden treasure: they have children in plenty, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 
As for me, in righteousness shall I behold thy face: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with contemplating thy likeness.
