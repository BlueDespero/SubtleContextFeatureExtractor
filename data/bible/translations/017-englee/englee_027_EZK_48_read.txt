Ezekiel.
Chapter 48.
Now these are the names of the tribes: At the edge, on the north side, along the road on the way to Chethlon, as far as Chamath, Chazar-'enan, the boundary of Damascus northward, alongside of Chamath, there shall be from the east side to the west for Dan one portion. 
And by the boundary of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, for Asher one portion. 
And by the boundary of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, for Naphtali one portion. 
And by the boundary of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, for Menasseh one portion. 
And by the boundary of Menasseh, from the east side unto the west side, for Ephraim one portion. 
And by the boundary of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, for Reuben one portion. 
And by the boundary of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, for Judah one portion. 
And by the boundary of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall set aside of five and twenty thousand rods in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. 
The oblation that ye shall set aside unto the Lord shall be in length five and twenty thousand rods, and in breadth ten thousand. 
And to these shall belong the holy oblation,—namely to the priests, toward the north, five and twenty thousand rods in length, and on the west ten thousand in breadth, and on the east ten thousand in breadth, and on the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst of it. 
Unto the priests, that are sanctified, of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
To them shall thus belong the portion set aside of the oblation of the land as a most holy thing by the boundary of the Levites. 
And the Levites shall have alongside the boundary of the priests five and twenty thousand rods in length, and in breadth ten thousand; the whole in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand. 
But they shall not sell aught thereof, or exchange, or alienate this first portion of the land; for it is holy unto the Lord. 
And the five thousand rods, that are left in the breadth, with a length of five and twenty thousand, shall be an unconsecrated land for the city, for dwelling, and for an open space: and the city shall be in the midst thereof. 
And these shall be its measures: The north side four thousand and five hundred rods, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
And the open space of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty rods, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 
And the produce of the residue in length alongside the holy oblation ten thousand rods eastward, and ten thousand westward, that which is alongside the holy oblation, shall be for food unto the laborers of the city. 
And the laborers of the city, men taken out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. 
All the oblation, five and twenty thousand rods by five and twenty thousand square, shall ye set apart as the holy oblation, with the possession of the city. 
And the residue shall belong to the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, alongside of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the eastern boundary, and westward alongside the five and twenty thousand toward the western boundary, alongside the portions of the tribes; for the prince shall it be: and so shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof. 
And both the possession of the Levites, and the possession of the city, shall be in the midst of that which belongeth to the prince: between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin, shall be for the prince. 
As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, shall be for Benjamin one portion. 
And by the boundary of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, for Simeon one portion. 
And by the boundary of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, for Issachar one portion. 
And by the boundary of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, for Zebulun one portion. 
And by the boundary of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, for Gad one portion. 
And by the boundary of Gad, on the southern side toward the south, shall be the boundary from Thamar unto the waters of contention of Kadesh, unto the brook by the Great Sea. 
This is the land which ye shall divide by lot for an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these are their allotted divisions, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And these are the outlines of the city: On the north side, five hundred and four thousand rods, by the measure. 
And of the gates of the city, being after the names of the tribes of Israel, shall be three gates on the north: the gate of Reuben one, the gate of Judah one, the gate of Levi one. 
And on the east side, five hundred and four thousand rods, with three gates: namely, the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of Dan one. 
And the south side, five hundred and four thousand rode by the measure, with three gates: the gate of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zebulun one. 
The west side, five hundred and four thousand rods, with their three gates: the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher one, the gate of Naphtali one. 
All around it shall be eighteen thousand rods: and the name of the city shall be from that day “The Lord is there.”
