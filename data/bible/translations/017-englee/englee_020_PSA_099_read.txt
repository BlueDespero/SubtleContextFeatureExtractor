Psalms.
Chapter 99.
The Lord reigneth; people tremble: he sitteth enthroned over the cherubim; the earth is moved. 
The Lord is great in Zion; and he is exalted above all the people. 
They will give thanks to thy name, great, and terrible, and holy it is. 
And to the power of the king who loveth justice and righteousness hast thou truly executed in Jacob. 
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and bow yourselves down before his footstool: he is holy.— 
Moses and Aaron were among his priests, and Samuel among those that call on his name; they called on the Lord, and he answered them. 
In the pillar of cloud he used to speak unto them: they kept his testimonies, and the statutes which he had given unto them. 
O Lord, our God, thou didst answer them: thou wast a forgiving God unto them, yet also an avenger for their wrong doings. 
Exalt the Lord our God, and bow yourselves down before his holy mount; for holy is the Lord our God.
