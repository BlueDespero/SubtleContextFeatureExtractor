Psalms.
Chapter 141.
“A psalm of David.” O Lord, I call thee, hasten unto me: give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee. 
May my prayer be valued as incense before thee, the lifting up of my hands, as the evening offering. 
Set, O Lord, a watch unto my mouth: keep a guard at the door of my lips. 
Permit not my heart to incline after any evil thing, to practise deeds in wickedness with men that are doers of wrong: and let me not eat of their dainties. 
If the righteous strike me, it is a kindness; and if he reprove me, it is as oil poured on the head, my head shall not refuse it; for yet my prayer also is offered in their sufferings. 
Are their judges fallen down through means of a rock: then will they listen to my words; for they are pleasant. 
As when one cutteth in and splitteth open the earth: so are our bones scattered for the mouth of the grave. 
For unto thee, O Eternal Lord, are my eyes directed; in thee do I trust: pour not out my life. 
Guard me from the power of the snare which they have laid for me, and the traps of the wrong-doers. 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, altogether—while I pass safely by.
