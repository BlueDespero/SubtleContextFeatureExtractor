Psalms.
Chapter 130.
“A song of the degrees.” Out of the depths have I called thee, O Lord. 
Lord, listen to my voice: let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
If thou, Lord, shouldst treasure up iniquities, O Lord, who would be able to stand? 
But with thee there is forgiveness, in order that thou mayest be feared. 
I hope for the Lord, my soul doth hope, and for his word do I wait. 
My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning expect the morning. 
Let Israel wait for the Lord; for with the Lord there is kindness, and with him is redemption in abundance; 
And he wilt surely redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
