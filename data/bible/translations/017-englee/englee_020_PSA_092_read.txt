Psalms.
Chapter 92.
“A psalm or song for the sabbath day.” (92:2) It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: 
(92:3) To tell in the morning of thy kindness, and of thy faithfulness in the nights. 
(92:4) Upon a ten-stringed instrument, and upon the psaltery; and with the sweet sound of the harp. 
(92:5) For thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Lord, through thy doing: because of the works of thy hands will I triumph. 
(92:6) How great are thy works, O Lord! exceedingly profound are thy thoughts. 
(92:7) A brutish man knoweth it not, and a fool cannot understand this. 
(92:8) When the wicked spring up like herbs, and when all the workers of wickedness do flourish; it is that they may be destroyed evermore. 
(92:9) But thou art exalted to eternity, O Lord! 
(92:10) For, lo, thy enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thy enemies shall perish: all the workers of wickedness shall be scattered. 
(92:11) But thou exaltest my horn like that of a reem: I am anointed with fresh oil. 
(92:12) And my eye looketh on the punishment of those that regard me with envy: of the evildoers that rise up against me my ears shall bear it. 
(92:13) The righteous shall spring up like the palm-tree: like a cedar in Lebanon shall he grow high. 
(92:14) Planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our God shall they spring up. 
(92:15) They shall still flourish in high old age; they shall be vigorous and covered with foliage; 
(92:16) To declare that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no faultiness in him.
