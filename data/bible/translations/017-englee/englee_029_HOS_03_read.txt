Hosea.
Chapter 3.
Then said the Lord unto me, Go once more, love a woman beloved of her husband, yet committing adultery; like the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel, who turn themselves after other gods, and love flagons of wine. 
So I bought me such a one for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a chomer of barley, and half a chomer of barley. 
And I said unto her, Many days shalt thou abide true for me: thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not belong to any man, and so will I also be toward thee. 
For many days shall the children of Israel abide without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without a standing image, and without an ephod and theraphim. 
After that will the children of Israel return, and seek for the Lord their God and David their king; and fearing will they hasten to the Lord and to his goodness in the latter days,
