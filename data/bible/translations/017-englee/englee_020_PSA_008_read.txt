Psalms.
Chapter 8.
“To the chief musician upon Gittith, a psalm of David.” (8:2) O Eternal One our Lord, how excellent is thy name on all the earth! thou who hast set thy majesty above the heavens. 
(8:3) Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou founded thy might, because of thy opponents, that thou mightest bring to silence the enemy and him that seeketh vengeance. 
(8:4) When I behold thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast established:— 
(8:5) What is the mortal, that thou rememberest him? and the son of man, that thou thinkest of him: 
(8:6) Yet thou hast made him but a little less than angels, and hast crowned him with honor and glory. 
(8:7) Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; every thing hast thou placed beneath his feet: 
(8:8) Flocks and herds altogether, and also the beasts of the field; 
(8:9) The birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 
(8:10) O Eternal One our Lord, how excellent is thy name on all the earth!
