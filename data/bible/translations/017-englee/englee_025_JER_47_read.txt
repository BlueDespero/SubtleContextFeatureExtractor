Jeremiah.
Chapter 47.
The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before the time that Pharaoh smote Gazzah. 
Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, waters are coming up out of the north, and they shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land, and what filleth it; the city, and those that dwell therein: and the men shall cry aloud, and every inhabitant of the land shall wail. 
Because of the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stud-horses, because of the rushing sound of his chariots, the rumbling of his wheels, fathers do not turn round to their children from their feebleness of hands; 
Because of the day that cometh to devastate all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth; for the Lord devastateth the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphthor. 
Baldness is come upon Gazzah; ruined is Ashkelon with the remnant of their valley: how long yet wilt thou cut thyself? 
Woe! thou sword of the Lord, how long yet wilt thou not be quiet? withdraw thyself into thy scabbard, take thee rest, and be still. 
Yet how canst thou be quiet? When the Lord hath given it a charge, against Ashkelon, and against the sea-coast—thither hath he destined it.
