Jeremiah.
Chapter 28.
And it came to pass in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that there said unto me Chananyah the son of 'Azzur the prophet, who was from Gib'on, in the house of the Lord, before the eyes of the priests, and of all the people, as followeth, 
Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon; 
Within yet two years' time will I cause to be brought back unto this place all the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath taken away from this place, and which he hath carried to Babylon: 
And Jechonyah the son of Jehoyakim the king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah that are gone to Babylon, will I cause to return to this place, saith the Lord; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
Then said Jeremiah the prophet unto Chananyah the prophet before the eyes of the priests, and before the eyes of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord, 
Yea, then said Jeremiah the prophet, Amen, may the Lord do so: may the Lord fulfill thy words which thou hast prophesied, to cause the vessels of the Lord's house, and all that have been carried into exile, to be brought back from Babylon unto this place. 
Nevertheless hear thou now this word which I speak before thy ears, and before the ears of all the people: 
The prophets that have been before me and before thee from olden times prophesied both concerning many countries, and against great kingdoms, respecting war, and respecting evil, and respecting pestilence. 
The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet doth come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, as the one whom the Lord hath sent in truth. 
Then took Chananyah the prophet the yoke-bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke it. 
And Chananyah said before the eyes of all the people, as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord, Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon within two years' time from the neck of all the nations. And Jeremiah the prophet went his way. 
Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, after Chananyah the prophet had broken the yoke-bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 
Go and say unto Chananyah as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord, Yoke-bars of wood hast thou broken; but thou shalt make in their stead yoke-bars of iron. 
For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, A yoke of iron have I placed upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon; and they shall work for him: and also the beasts of the field have I given him. 
Then said Jeremiah the prophet unto Chananyah the prophet, Hear now, Chananyah, The Lord did not send thee; but thou hast caused this people to trust on a falsehood. 
Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against the Lord. 
So Chananyah the prophet died in that same year, in the seventh month.
