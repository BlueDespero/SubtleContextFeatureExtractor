Psalms.
Chapter 34.
“By David, when he disguised his reason before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.” (34:2) I will bless the Lord at all times: continually shall his praise be in my mouth. 
(34:3) My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear it, and be rejoiced. 
(34:4) Oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
(34:5) I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and from all that I dreaded did he deliver me. 
(34:6) They who looked unto him, were indeed enlightened, and their faces were not put to the blush. 
(34:7) This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and out of all his distresses did he save him. 
(34:8) The angel of the Lord encampeth round about those who fear him, and delivereth them. 
(34:9) Experience and see that the Lord is good: happy is the man that trusteth in him. 
(34:10) Oh fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to those who fear him. 
(34:11) The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good. 
(34:12) Come, ye children, hearken unto me: the fear of the Lord will I teach you. 
(34:13) Who is the man that desireth life, loveth many days, that he may see happiness? 
(34:14) Guard thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking deceit. 
(34:15) Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
(34:16) The eyes of the Lord are directed unto the righteous, and his ears unto their cry. 
(34:17) But the anger of the Lord is against those that do evil, to cut off from the earth their remembrance. 
(34:18) Those cry, and the Lord heareth, and from all their distresses he delivereth them. 
(34:19) The Lord is nigh unto those that are broken-hearted: and he saveth those that are of a contrite spirit. 
(34:20) Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but out of them all the Lord ever delivereth him. 
(34:21) He watcheth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 
(34:22) The evil will slay the wicked: and they who hate the righteous shall incur guiltiness. 
(34:23) The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and all that trust in him shall not incur guiltiness.
