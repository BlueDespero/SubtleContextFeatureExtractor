Psalms.
Chapter 144.
“By David.” Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who exerciseth my hands for the battle, my fingers for the war: 
My kindness, and my strong-hold; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 
Lord, what is man, that thou takest cognizance of him: the son of a mortal, that thou regardest him! 
Man is like the breath: his days are like a passing shadow. 
O Lord, bend thy heavens, and come down: touch the mountains, that they may smoke. 
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: send out thy arrows, and confound them. 
Stretch out thy hands from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of the children of the stranger. 
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is the right hand of falsehood. 
O God, a new song will I sing unto thee: upon the ten-stringed psaltery will I sing praises unto thee. 
Thou art he that giveth victory unto kings: who riddeth David his servant from the evil-bringing sword. 
Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of the children of the stranger, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is the right hand of falsehood. 
So that our sons may be like plants, grown up in their youth: our daughters, like corner-pillars, sculptured in the model of a palace. 
May our garners be full, furnishing all manner of store: our sheep bringing forth thousands and ten thousands in our open pastures. 
May our oxen be strong to labor: may there be no breach, nor migration, nor loud complaint in our streets. 
Happy the people, that fare thus: happy the people, whose God is the Lord.
