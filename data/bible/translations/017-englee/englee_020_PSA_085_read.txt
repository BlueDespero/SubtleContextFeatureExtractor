Psalms.
Chapter 85.
“To the chief musician, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” (85:2) Thou hast been favorable, O Lord, unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 
(85:3) Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered over all their sin. Selah. 
(85:4) Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast relinquished the fierceness of thy anger. 
(85:5) Return to us, O God of our salvation, and cause thy ill-will toward us to cease. 
(85:6) Wilt thou be wroth with us for ever? wilt thou extend thy anger from generation to generation? 
(85:7) Wilt thou not now revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee? 
(85:8) Show us thy kindness, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. 
(85:9) I will hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his pious ones: only let them not turn again to folly. 
(85:10) Surely, nigh is his salvation unto those that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land. 
(85:11) Kindness and truth are met together: righteousness and peace kiss each other. 
(85:12) Truth will grow up out of the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven. 
(85:13) Yea, the Lord will also give the good, and our land will yield its products. 
(85:14) Righteousness will walk firmly before him, and will make level the way by its steps.
