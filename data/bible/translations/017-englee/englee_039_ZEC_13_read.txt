Zechariah.
Chapter 13.
On that day shall there be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for cleansing from sin and for purification. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall not be remembered any more: and also the prophets and the unclean spirit will I remove out of the land. 
And it shall come to pass, if any one should yet prophesy, that his father and his mother who have begotten him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for falsely hast thou spoken in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother who have begotten him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one because of his vision, when he prophesieth; and they shall not clothe themselves with a hairy cloak in order to deceive. 
But he will say, I am no prophet, a man that tilleth the ground am I; for some one hath taught me to keep cattle from my youth. 
And should some one say unto him, What are these wounds between thy hands? Then will he say, Those with which I have been wounded in the house of my vicious friends. 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man whom I have associated with me, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; but I will turn my hand toward the feeble ones. 
And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts of those therein shall be cut off, shall perish; but the third part shall be left therein. 
And I will bring the third part into the fire, and I will refine them as one refineth silver, and will probe them as gold is probed: they will call on my name, and I will answer their prayer; I will say, They arc my people; and they will say, The Lord is my God.
