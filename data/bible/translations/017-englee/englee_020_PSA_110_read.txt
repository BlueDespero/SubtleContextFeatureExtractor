Psalms.
Chapter 110.
“By David, a psalm.” The Eternal saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I place thy enemies as a stool for thy feet. 
The staff of thy strength will the Eternal stretch forth out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies. 
Thy people will bring freewill-gifts on the day of thy power, in the ornaments of holiness: as out of the bosom of the morning-dawn so is thine the dew of thy youth. 
The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent of it, Thou shalt be a priest for ever after the order of Malki-zedek. 
The Lord at thy right hand crusheth kings on the day of his wrath. 
He will judge among the nations—there shall be a fulness of corpses—he crusheth heads on a wide-spread land. 
From the brook will he drink on the way: therefore will he lift up the head.
