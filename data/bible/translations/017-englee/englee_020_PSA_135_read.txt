Psalms.
Chapter 135.
Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord; 
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. 
Hallelujah; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is lovely. 
For Jacob hath the Lord chosen unto himself, Israel, as his peculiar treasure. 
For I well know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
Whatsoever the Lord willeth, hath he done in the heavens, and on the earth, in the seas, and in all the deeps. 
He causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. 
He it is who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and of cattle; 
Who sent signs and wonderful tokens into the midst of thee, O Egypt, against Pharaoh, and against all his servants; 
Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings; 
Sichon the king of the Emorites, and 'Og the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan; 
And gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance unto Israel his people. 
O Lord, thy name endureth for ever: O Lord, thy memorial is throughout all generations. 
For the Lord will espouse the cause of his people, and concerning his servants will he bethink himself. 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of the hands of men. 
Mouths they have, but they speak not; eyes they have, but they see not; 
Ears they have, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouth. 
Like them are those that make them, every one that trusteth in them. 
O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord; O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord. 
O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord; ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord. 
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, even he that resideth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
