Psalms.
Chapter 115.
Not for our sake, O Lord, not for our sake, but unto thy name give glory, for the sake of thy kindness, for the sake of thy truth. 
Wherefore should the nations say, Where now is their God? 
Whereas our God is in the heavens: whatsoever he desireth hath he done. 
Their idols are sliver and gold, the work of the hands of man. 
A mouth they have, but speak not; eyes they have, but see not; 
Ears they have, but hear not; a nose they have, but smell not. 
They have hands, but they touch not; they have feet, but they walk not: nor do they give any utterance by their throat. 
Like them are those that make them, every one that trusteth in them. 
O Israel, trust thou in the Lord—he is their help and their shield. 
O house of Aaron, trust ye in the Lord—he is their help and their shield. 
Ye that fear the Lord, trust ye in the Lord—he is their help and their shield. 
The Lord hath even been mindful of us, he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 
He will bless those that fear the Lord, the small together with the great. 
May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children. 
Blessed are ye of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. 
The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
Not the dead can praise the Lord, nor all those that go down into the silence of death. 
But as for us, we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Hallelujah.
