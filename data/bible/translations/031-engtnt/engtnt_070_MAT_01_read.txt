The byrthe of Iesus Christ was on thys wyse. When hys mother Mary was betrouthed to Ioseph before they came to dwell to gedder she was foude with chylde by the holy goost. 
The Ioseph her husbande beinge a perfect man and loth to make an ensample of her was mynded to put her awaye secretely. 
Whill he thus thought behold the angell of the Lorde appered vnto him in a dreame saynge: Ioseph the sonne of David feare not to take vnto ye Mary thy wyfe. For that which is conceaved in her is of the holy goost. 
She shall brynge forthe a sonne and thou shalt call his name Iesus. For he shall save his peple from their synnes. 
All this was done to fulfill that which was spoken of the Lorde by the Prophet saynge: 
Beholde a mayde shall be with chylde and shall brynge forthe a sonne and they shall call his name Emanuel which is by interpretacion God with vs. 
And Ioseph assone as he awoke out of slepe did as the angell of the Lorde bade hym and toke hys wyfe vnto hym 
and knewe her not tyll she had brought forth hir fyrst sonne and called hys name Iesus.
