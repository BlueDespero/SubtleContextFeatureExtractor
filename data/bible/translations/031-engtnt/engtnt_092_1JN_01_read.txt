Chapter 1.
That which was from the begynninge concerninge which we have hearde which we have sene with oure eyes which we have loked vpon and oure hondes have hadled of the worde of life. 
For the lyfe appered and we have sene and beare witnes and shewe vnto you that eternall lyfe which was with the father and appered vnto vs. 
That which we have sene and herde declare we vnto you that ye maye have felloushippe with vs and that oure fellishippe maye be with the father and his sonne Iesus Christ. 
And this write we vnto you that oure ioye maye be full. 
And this is the tydynges which we have hearde of him and declare vnto you that god is lyght and in him is no darknes at all 
yf we saye that we have fellishippe with him and yet walke in darknes we lye and do not the truth: 
but and yf we walke in (lyght) even as he is in lyght then have we fellishippe with him and the bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne clenseth vs from all synne. 
Yf we saye that we have no synne we deceave oure selves and trueth is not in vs. 
Yf we knowledge oure synnes he is faythfull and iust to forgeve vs oure synnes and to clense vs from all vnrightewesnes. 
Yf we saye we have not sinned we make him a lyar and his worde is not in vs.
