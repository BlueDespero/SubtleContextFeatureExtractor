Acts.
Chapter 6.
In those dayes as the nombre of the disciples grewe ther arose a grudge amonge the Grekes agaynst the Ebrues because their wyddowes were despysed in the dayly mynystracion. 
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to gether and sayde: it is not mete that we shuld leave the worde of God and serve at the tables. 
Wherfore brethren loke ye out amonge you seven men of honest reporte and full of the holy goost and wysdome which we maye apoynte to this nedfull busynes. 
But we will geve oure selves cotinually to prayer and to the ministracion of the worde. 
And the sayinge pleased the whoale multitude. And they chose Steven a man full of fayth and of the holy goost and Philip and Prochorus and Nichanor and Timon and Permenas and Nicholas a converte of Antioche. 
Which they set before the Apostles and they prayed and layde their hondes on them. 
And the worde of God encreased and the noubre of the disciples multiplied in Ierusalem greatly and a great company of the prestes were obedient to the faythe. 
And Steven full of faythe and power dyd great wondres and myracles amonge the people. 
Then ther arose certayne of the synagoge which are called Lybertines and Syrenites and of Alexandria and of Cilicia and Asia and disputed with Steven. 
And they coulde not resist the wysdome and the sprete with which he spake. 
Then sent they in men which sayd: we have hearde him speake blasphemous wordes agaynst Moses and agaynst God. 
And they moved the people and the elders and the scribes: and came apon him and caught him and brought him to the counsell 
and brought forth falce witnesses which sayde. This man ceasith not to speake blasphemous wordes agaynst this holy place and the lawe: 
for we hearde him saye: this Iesus of Nazareth shall destroye this place and shall chaunge the ordinaunces which Moses gave vs. 
And all that sate in the counsell loked stedfastly on him and sawe his face as it had bene the face of an angell.
