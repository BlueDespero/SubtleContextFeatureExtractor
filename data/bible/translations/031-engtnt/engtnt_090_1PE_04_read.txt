1 Peter.
Chapter 4.
For as moche as christ hath suffred for vs in the flesshe arme youre selves lyke wyse with the same mynde: for he which suffereth in the flesshe ceasith from synne 
that he hence forwarde shuld lyve as moche tyme as remayneth in the flesshe: not after the lustes of men but after the will of God. 
For it is sufficient for vs that we have spent the tyme that is past of the lyfe after the will of the gentyls walkinge in wantannes lustes dronkennes in eatinge drinkinge and in abominable ydolatrie. 
And it semeth to them a straunge thinge that ye runne not also with them vnto the same excesse of ryote and therfore speake they evill of you 
which shall geve a comptes to him that is redy to iudge quycke and deed. 
For vnto this purpose verely was the gospell preached vnto the (deed) that they shuld be condempned of men in the flesshe but shuld live before God in the sprete. 
The ende of all thinges is at honde. Be ye therfore discrete and sober that ye maye be apte to prayers. 
But above all thinges have fervet love amonge you. For love covereth the multitude of synnes. 
Be ye herberous one to another and that with out grudginge. 
As every man hath receaved the gyfte minister the same one to another as good ministers of the manyfolde grace of God. 
Yf eny man speake let him talke as though he spake the wordes of God. If eny man minister let him do it as of the abilitie which god ministreth vnto him. That god in all thinges maye be glorified thorow Iesus Christ to whom be prayse and dominion for ever and whyll the worlde stondeth. Amen. 
Dearly beloved be not troubled in this heate which now is come amonge you to trye you as though some strauge thinge had happened vnto you: 
but reioyce in as moche as ye are partetakers of Christes passions that when his glory appereth ye maye be mery and glad. 
If ye be rayled vpon for the name of Christ happie are ye. For the sprete of glory and the sprete of god resteth apon you. On their parte he is evyll spoken of: but on youre parte he is glorified. 
Se that none of you suffre as a murtherer or as a thefe or an evyll doar or as a busybody in other mens matters. 
Yf eny man suffre as a Christe man let him not be ashamed: but let him glorifie god on his behalfe. 
For the tyme is come that iudgement must begynne at the housse of god. If it fyrst begynne at vs what shall the ende be of them which beleve not the gospell of god? 
And yf the righteous scasly be saved: where shall the vngodly and the sinner appere? 
Wherfore let them that suffer accordynge to the will of god commit their soules to him with well doynge as vnto a faythfull creator.
