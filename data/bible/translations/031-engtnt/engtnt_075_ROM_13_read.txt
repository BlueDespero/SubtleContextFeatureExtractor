Romans.
Chapter 13.
Let every soule submit him selfe vnto the auctorite of the hyer powers. For there is no power but of God. The powers that be are ordeyned of God. 
Whosoever therfore resysteth power resisteth the ordinaunce of God. And they that resist shall receave to the selfe damnacion. 
For rulars are not to be feared for good workes but for evyll. Wilt thou be with out feare of the power? Do well then: and so shalt thou be praysed of the same. 
For he is the minister of God for thy welth. But and yf thou do evyll then feare: for he beareth not a swearde for nought: but is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on them that do evyll. 
Wherfore ye must nedes obeye not for feare of vengeaunce only: but also because of conscience. 
And even for this cause paye ye tribute. For they are goddes ministers servynge for the same purpose. 
Geve to every man therfore his duetie: Tribute to whom tribute belongeth: Custome to whom custome is due: feare to whom feare belongeth: Honoure to who honoure pertayneth. 
Owe nothinge to eny man: but to love one another. For he that loveth another fulfylleth the lawe. For these commaundementes: 
Thou shalt not commit advoutry: Thou shalt not kyll: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnes: Thou shalt not desyre and so forth (yf there be eny other commaundement) they are all comprehended in this sayinge: Love thyne neghbour as thy selfe. 
Love hurteth not his neghbour. Therfore is love the fulfillynge of the lawe. 
This also we knowe I mean the season howe that it is tyme that we shuld now awake oute of slepe. For now is oure salvacion nearer then when we beleved. 
The nyght is passed and the daye is come nye. Let us therfore cast awaye the dedes of darcknes and let vs put on the (Armoure) of lyght. 
Let vs walke honestly as it were in the daye lyght: not in eatynge and drinkynge: nether in chamburynge and wantannes: nether in stryfe and envyinge: 
but put the on the Lorde Iesus Christ. And make not provision for the flesshe to fulfyll the lustes of it.
