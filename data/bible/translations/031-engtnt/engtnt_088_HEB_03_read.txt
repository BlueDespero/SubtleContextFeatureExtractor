Hebrews.
Chapter 3.
Wherfore holy brethren partakers of the celestiall callinge consyder the embasseatour and hye prest of oure profession Christ Iesus 
which was faythfull to him that made him even as was Moses in all his housse. 
And this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses: In as moche as he which hath prepared the housse hath most honoure in the housse. 
Every housse is prepared of some man. But he that ordeyned all thinges is god. 
And Moses verely was faythfull in all his housse as a minister to beare witnes of tho thinges which shuld be spoken afterwarde. 
But Christ as a sonne hath rule over the housse whose housse are we so that we hold fast the confydence and the reioysynge of that hope vnto the ende. 
Wherfore as the holy goost sayth: to daye if ye shall heare his voyce 
harden not youre hertes after the rebellyon in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes 
where youre fathers tempted me proved me and sawe my workes xl. yeare longe. 
Wherfore I was greved with the generacion and sayde. They erre ever in their hertes: they verely have not knowe my wayes 
so that I sware in my wrathe that they shuld not enter into my rest. 
Take hede brethren that therbe in none of you an evyll herte in vnbeleve that he shuld departe from the lyvynge god: 
but exhorte one another dayly whill is it called to daye lest eny of you wexe harde herted thorow the deceytfullnesse of sinne. 
We are partetakers of Christ yf we kepe sure vnto the ende the fyrst substance 
so longe as it is sayd: to daye yf ye heare his voyce harde not youre hertes as when ye rebelled. 
For some when they hearde rebelled: howbe it not all that came out of Egypt vnder Moses. 
But with who was he despleased .xl. yeares? Was he not displeased with them that synned: whose carkases were overthorwen in the desert? 
To whom sware he that they shuld not enter into his rest: but vnto them that beleved not? 
And we se that they coulde not enter in because of vnbeleve.
