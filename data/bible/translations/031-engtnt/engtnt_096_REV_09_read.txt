Revelation.
Chapter 9.
And the fyfte angell blewe and I sawe a stare fall from heven vnto the erth. And to him was geven the kaye of the bottomlesse pytt. 
And he opened the botomlesse pytt and there arose the smoke of a grett fornace. And the sunne and the ayer were darkned by the reason of the smoke of the pytt. 
And there cam out of the smoke locustes vpon the erth: and vnto them was geve power as the scorpions of the erth have power. 
And it hurt the grasse of the erth: nether eny grene thinge: nether eny tree: but only those me which have not the seale in their forhedes 
and to the was commaunded that they shulde not kyll them but that they shulde be vexed v monethes and their payne was as the payne that cometh of a scorpion when he hath stoge a man. 
And in those dayes shall men seke deeth and shall not fynde it and shall desyre to dye and deeth shall flye from them. 
And the similitude of the locustes was lyke vnto horses prepared vnto battayll and on their heddes were as it were crownes lyke vnto golde: and their faces were as it had bene the faces of men. 
And they had heare as the heare of wemen. And their tethe were as the tethe of lyons. 
And they had habbergions as it were habbergions of yron. And the sounde of their wynges was as the sounde of charettes when many horsses runne to gedder to battayle. 
And they had tayles lyke vnto scorpions and there were stinges in their tayles. And their power was to hurt men v. monethes. 
And they had a kynge over them which is the angell of the bottomlesse pytt whose name in the hebrew tonge is Abadon: but in the greke tonge Apollion. 
One woo is past and beholde two wooes come after this. 
And the sixte. angell blewe and I herd a voyce from the iiii. corners of the golden aultre which is before god 
saying to the sixte angell which had the trompe: Loose the iiii. angelles which are bounde in the grett ryver Eufrates. 
And the iiii. angelles were loosed which wer prepared for an houre for a daye for a moneth and for a yeare for to slee the thyrde part of men. 
And the nombre of horsme of warre were twenty tymes xM. And I herde the nobre of them. 
And thus I sawe the horses in a vision and them that sate on the havynge fyry habbergions of a Iacyncte coloure and brymstony and the heeddes of the horses werre as the heeddes of lyons. And out of their mouthes went forth fyre and smoke and brymstone. 
And of these iii. was the thyrde parte of men kylled: that is to saye of fyre smoke and brymstone which proceded out of the mouthes of them: 
For their power was in their mouthes and in their tayles: for their tayles were lyke vnto serpetes and had heedes and with them they dyd hurt: 
And the remnaunt of the men which were not kylled by these plages repented not of the dedes of their hondes that they shulde not worshyppe devyls and ymages of golde and sylver and brasse and stone and of wood which nether can se nether heare nether goo. 
Also they repented not of their murther and of their sorcery nether of their fornacion nether of their thefte.
