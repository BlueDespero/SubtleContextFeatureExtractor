1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
There goeth a commen sayinge that ther is fornicacion amonge you and soche fornicacion as is not once named amonge the gentyls: that one shuld have his fathers wyfe. 
And ye swell and have not rather sorowed that he which hath done this dede myght be put from amonge you. 
For I verely as absent in body even so present in sprete have determyned all redy (as though I were present) of him that hath done this dede 
in the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ when ye are gaddered togedder and my sprete with the power of the Lorde Iesus Christ 
to deliver him vnto Satan for the destruccion of the flesshe that the sprete maye be saved in the daye of the Lorde Iesus. 
Youre reioysinge is not good: knowe ye not that a lytle leve sowreth the whole lompe of dowe. 
Pourge therfore the olde leven that ye maye be newe dowe as ye are swete breed. For Christ oure esterlambe is offered vp for vs. 
Therfore let vs kepe holy daye not with olde leve nether with the leven of maliciousnes and wickednes: but with the swete breed of purenes and truth. 
I wrote vnto you in a pistle that ye shuld not company with fornicatours. 
And I meant not at all of the fornicatours of this worlde ether of the coveteous or of extorsioners ether of the ydolaters: for then must ye nedes have gone out of the worlde. 
But now I write vnto you that ye company not togedder yf eny that is called a brother be a fornicator or coveteous or a worshipper of ymages ether a raylar ether a dronkard or an extorcionar: with him that is soche se that ye eate not. 
For what have I to do to iudge them which are with out? Do ye not iudge them that are with in? 
Them that are with out God shall iudge. Put awaye from amonge you that evyll parson.
