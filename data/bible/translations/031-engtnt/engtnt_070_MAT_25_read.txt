Matthew.
Chapter 25.
Then the kyngdome of heven shalbe lykened vnto .x. virgins which toke their lampes and wet to mete the brydgrome: 
fyve of them were folysshe and fyve were wyse. 
The folysshe toke their lampes but toke none oyle with the. 
But the wyse tooke oyle with the in their vesselles with their lampes also. 
Whill the brydgrome taryed all slombred and slepte. 
And even at mydnyght there was a crye made: beholde the brydgrome cometh goo out against him. 
Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lampes. 
And the folysshe sayde to the wyse: geve vs of youre oyle for our lampes goo out? 
but the wyse answered sayinge. Not so lest ther be not ynough for vs and you: but goo rather to them that sell and by for youre selves. 
And whill they went to bye the brydgrome came: and they that were redy went in with him to the weddinge and the gate was shett vp: 
Afterwardes came also the other virgins sayinge: master master open to vs. 
But he answered and sayde: verely I saye vnto you: I knowe not you. 
Watche therefore: for ye knowe nether the daye nor yet the houre when the sonne of man shall come. 
Lykwyse as a certeyne man redy to take his iorney to a straunge countre called his servautes and delivered to them his gooddes. 
And vnto one he gave .v. talentes to another .ii. and to another one: to every man after his abilite and streyght waye departed. 
Then he that had receaved the fyve talentes went and bestowed them and wanne other fyve talentes. 
Lykwyse he that receaved .ii. gayned other .ii. 
But he that receaved the one went and digged a pit in the erth and hyd his masters money. 
After a longe season the lorde of those servauntes came and rekened with them. 
Then came he that had receaved fyve talentes and brought other fyve talentes sayinge: master thou deliveredst vnto one fyve talentes: beholde I have gayned with the fyve talentes moo. 
The his master sayde vnto him: well good servaut and faithfull. Thou hast bene faithfull in lytell I will make the ruler over moche: entre in into thy masters ioye. 
Also he that receaved .ii. talentes came and sayde: master thou deliveredest vnto me .ii. talentes: beholde I have wone .ii. other talentes with them. 
And his master sayde vnto him well good servaunt and faithfull. Thou hast bene faithfull in lytell I wyll make the ruler over moche: go in into thy masters ioye. 
Then he which had receaved the one talent came and sayd: master I considered that thou wast an harde man which repest where thou sowedst not and gadderest where thou strawedst not 
and was therfore afrayde and went and hyd thy talent in the erth: Beholde thou hast thyn awne. 
His master answered and sayde vnto him: thou evyll servaut and slewthfull thou knewest that I repe where I sowed not and gaddre where I strawed not: 
thou oughtest therfore to have had my money to the chaugers and then at my comynge shulde I have receaved myne awne with vauntage. 
Take therfore the talent from him and geve it vnto him which hath .x. talentes 
For vnto every man that hath shalbe geven and he shall have aboundance: and from him that hath not shalbe taken awaye even that he hath. 
And cast that vnprofitable servaunt into vtter dercknes: there shalbe wepynge and gnasshinge of teeth. 
When the sonne of man cometh in his glorie and all the holy angels with him then shall he syt vpon the seate of his glorie 
and before him shalbe Gaddred all nacions. And he shall seperate the one from a nother as a shepherde deuideth the shepe from the gootes. 
And he shall set the shepe on his right honde and the gotes on the lyfte. 
Then shall the kynge saye to them on his right honde: Come ye blessed chyldren of my father inheret the the kyngdo prepared for you from the beginninge of the worlde. 
For I was anhongred and ye gave me meate. I thursted and ye gave me drinke. I was herbourlesse and ye lodged me. 
I was naked and ye clothed me. I was sicke and ye visited me. I was in preson and ye came vnto me. 
Then shall the righteous answere him sayinge master when sawe we the anhongred and feed the? or a thurst and gave the drinke? 
when sawe we the herbourlesse and lodged the? or naked and clothed the? 
or when sawe we the sicke or in preson and came vnto the? 
And the kynge shall answere and saye vnto them: verely I saye vnto you: in as moche as ye have done it vnto one of the leest of these my brethren ye have done it to me. 
Then shall the kynge saye vnto them that shalbe on the lyfte hande: departe from me ye coursed into everlastinge fire which is prepared for the devyll and his angels. 
For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meate. I thursted and ye gave me no drinke. 
I was herbourlesse and ye lodged me not. I was naked and ye clothed me not. I was sicke and in preson and ye visited me not. 
Then shall they also answere him sayinge: master when sawe we the an hungred or a thurst or herbourlesse or naked or sicke or in preson and did not ministre vnto the? 
Then shall he answere the and saye: Verely I saye vnto you in as moche as ye did it not to one of the leest of these ye did it not to me. 
And these shall go into everlastinge payne: And the righteous into lyfe eternall.
