Chapter 13.
Yahweh, how long will you continue to forget about me RHQ? Will you hide yourself SYN from me forever? 
How long must I endure anguish/worry? Must I be miserable/sad every day? How long will my enemies continue to defeat me? 
Yahweh my God, look at me and answer me. Enable me to become strong again IDM, and do not allow me to die. 
Do not allow my enemies to boast saying, “We have defeated him!” Do not allow them to defeat me, with the result that they will rejoice about it! 
But I trust that you will faithfully love me; I will rejoice when you rescue me. 
Yahweh, you have done many good things for me, so I will sing to you.
