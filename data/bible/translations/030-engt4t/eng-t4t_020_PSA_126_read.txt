Chapter 126.
When Yahweh brought us Israeli people back to Jerusalem (OR, enabled us Israelis to prosper again), it was wonderful; it seemed as though SIM we were dreaming. 
We were extremely happy, and we SYN continued shouting joyfully. Then the other people-groups said about us, “Yahweh has done great things for them!” 
And we say, “Yes, Yahweh truly has done great things for us, and we are very happy.” 
Yahweh, when it rains, water flows in the streams again after they were dry SIM. Similarly, enable our nation to become great again like it was before. 
We cried when we planted seeds because it was hard work preparing the soil that had not been plowed for many years; now we want to shout joyfully because we are gathering a big harvest. 
Those who cried as they carried the bags of seeds to the fields will shout joyfully when they bring the crops to their houses at harvest time.
