Chapter 63.
God, you are the God whom I worship. I greatly desire to be with you like SIL a person in a dry hot desert greatly desires some cool water. 
So, I want to see you in your temple; I want to see that you are great and glorious. 
Your constantly loving me is ◄worth more/more precious► than my life, so I MTY will always praise you. 
I will praise you all the time that I live; I will lift up my hands to you while I pray. 
Knowing you satisfies me more than IDM, MET my eating a very big feast, so I will praise you while I sing MTY joyful songs. 
While I lie on my bed, I think about you. I think/meditate about you all during the night, 
because you have always helped me, and I sing joyfully knowing that I am protected by you as a little bird is protected under its mother’s wings MET. 
I cling to you; and with your hand/power you protect me. 
But those who are trying to kill me will die and descend into the place of the dead; 
they will be killed in battles MTY and their corpses will be eaten by jackals/wild dogs. 
But I, the king of Israel, will rejoice in what God has done; and all those who revere and trust God will praise him, but he will not allow liars to say anything.
