Chapter 70.
God, please save me! Yahweh, come quickly to help me! 
Humble those who are happy about my troubles/difficulties, and cause them to be disgraced/ashamed. Chase away those who are trying to kill me. 
I hope/desire that you will cause them to become dismayed and ashamed because you have defeated them. 
But I hope/desire that all those who go to worship you will be very joyful DOU. I want those who love you because you saved them to shout repeatedly HYP, “God is great!” 
As for me, I am poor and needy DOU; so God, come quickly to help me! Yahweh, you are the one who saves and helps me, so please come quickly!
