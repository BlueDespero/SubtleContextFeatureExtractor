PSALMS.
Chapter 134.
All you people who serve Yahweh, who stand up and ◄serve/pray to► him at night in his temple, come and praise him! 
Lift up your hands/arms to pray to him in the temple and praise him! 
And I want Yahweh, who created heaven and the earth, to bless you from where he lives in the temple on Zion Hill.
