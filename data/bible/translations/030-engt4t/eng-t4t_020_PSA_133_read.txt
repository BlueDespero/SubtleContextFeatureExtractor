Chapter 133.
It is very good and very pleasant for God’s people to gather together harmoniously. 
It is as delightful as the precious/expensive ◄olive oil/perfume► that runs down from the Supreme Priest Aaron’s head onto his beard when he is anointed and runs down onto the collar of his robes. 
Gathering together harmoniously is as delightful  as the dew that falls on Hermon Mountain and the dew that falls on the hills near Zion Hill. Yahweh has promised to bless his people there in Jerusalem by giving them everlasting (OR, a long-lasting) life.
