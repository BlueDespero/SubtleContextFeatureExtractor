PSALMS.
Chapter 131.
Yahweh, I am not proud and I have not thought highly about ◄myself/the things that I have done►. And I do not concern myself about things that you have done that are very big or very wonderful. 
Instead, I am calm and peaceful, like a small child who lies quietly in its mother’s arms SIM. In the same way, I am peaceful. 
You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh will do good things for you, now and forever!
