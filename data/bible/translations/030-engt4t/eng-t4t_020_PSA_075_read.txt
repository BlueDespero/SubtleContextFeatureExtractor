Chapter 75.
We give thanks to you; our God, we thank you. You are close to us, and we proclaim to others the wonderful things that you have done for us. 
You have said, “I have appointed a time when I will judge people, and I will judge everyone fairly. 
When the earth shakes and all the creatures on the earth tremble, I am the one who will ◄keep its foundations steady/prevent it from being destroyed►. 
I say to people who ◄boast/talk proudly about themselves►, ‘Stop bragging!’ and I say to wicked people, ‘Do not proudly do things to show how great you are IDM! 
Do not be arrogant, and do not speak so boastfully!’” 
The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west, and he does not come from the desert. 
God is the one who judges people; he says that some have sinned and must be punished, and that others have not done what is wrong. 
It is as though Yahweh holds a cup in his hand; it is filled with wine that has spices mixed in it to cause those who drink it to become more drunk; and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it; they will drink every drop of it, which means that he will give them all the punishment that they deserve. 
But as for me, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob worshiped has done; I will never quit singing to praise him. 
He will destroy the power IDM of wicked people, but he will cause righteous people to become more powerful.
