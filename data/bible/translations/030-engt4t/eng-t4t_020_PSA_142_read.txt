Chapter 142.
Yahweh, I cry out to you; I plead with you to help me. 
I am bringing to you all my problems; I am telling you all my troubles/difficulties. 
When I am very discouraged, you know what I should do. Wherever I walk, it is as though my enemies have hidden traps for me to fall into. 
I look around, but there is no one who pays attentionto me, no one who will protect me, no one who cares about what happens to me. 
So Yahweh, I cry out to you to help me; you are the one who protects me; and you are all that I need while I am alive. 
Listen to me while I cry out to you for help, because I am very distressed. Rescue/Save me from those who are pursuing me, because they are very strong, with the result that I cannot escape from them. 
Free/Rescue me from my troubles/difficulties MET in order that I may thank you. If you do that, when I am with godly/righteous people, I will praise you for having been very good to me.
