Chapter 67.
God, be merciful to us and bless us; be kind to us IDM, 
in order that everyone in the world may know what you want them to do, and the people of all nations may know that you have the power to save them. 
God, I desire that all people-groups will praise you; I want them all to praise you! 
I desire that the people of all nations will be glad and sing joyfully, because you judge the people-groups equally/justly, and you guide all nations in the world. 
God, I desire that the people-groups will praise you; I want them all to praise you! 
Good crops have grown on our land; God, our God, has blessed us. 
And because God has blessed us, I desire that all people everywhere MTY on the earth will revere him.
