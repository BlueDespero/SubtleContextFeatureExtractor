Chapter 97.
Yahweh is the king! I want everyone on the earth to be glad/happy, and the people who live on the islands in the oceans to also rejoice about that! 
There are very dark clouds around him to hide him; he rules MTY righteously/justly and fairly. 
He sends fire in front of him, and he completely burns all his enemies in that fire. 
All around the world he causes lightning to flash; people on the earth see it, and it causes them to be afraid and tremble. 
The mountains/hills melt like wax in front of Yahweh, the one who is the Lord, who rules over all the earth. 
The angels in MTY heaven proclaim that he acts righteously, and all the people-groups see his glory. 
Everyone who worships idols should be ashamed; all those who are proud of their false gods should realize that their gods are useless, It is as though all those gods bow down to worship Yahweh. 
The people MTY of Jerusalem hear about Yahweh and are glad/happy, and people in the other MTY cities in Judah also rejoice, because Yahweh judges and punishes wicked people. 
Yahweh is the supreme king over all the earth; he has very great power, and all the other gods have no power at all. 
Yahweh loves those who hate what people do that is evil; he protects the lives of his people, and he rescues them when the wicked people try to harm them. 
His light shines on righteous people; he causes those who are righteous to rejoice. 
You righteous people, rejoice about what Yahweh has done, and thank him, our holy God!
