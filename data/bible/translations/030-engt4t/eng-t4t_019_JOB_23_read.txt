JOB.
Chapter 23.
Then Job replied again, 
“Today I am again complaining bitterly/strongly to God; I continue groaning, but he SYN continues to ◄punish me/cause me to suffer►. 
I ◄wish that I knew/want to know► where I could meet/talk with him, so that I could go to the place where he lives. 
If I could do that, I would tell him why I know that I am innocent; I would tell MTY to him all my ◄arguments/evidence to show that I have not done what is evil►. 
Then I would find out what he would reply to me DOU. 
Would he use his great power to argue with me? No, he would listen to me carefully. 
I am ◄an honest/a righteous► man; so I would be able to discuss things with him fairly, and then he would declare that I am innocent, and that decision would endure forever. 
“But, I have gone to the east, and he is not there; I have gone to the west, but I have not found him there. 
I have gone north and I have gone south, but I have not seen him anywhere. 
But he knows how I have conducted my life; and when he has finished testing me, he will see that I am as pure as SIM gold whose impurities have all been burned out. 
I SYN have faithfully walked on the path that he showed me; I have not stopped obeying him. 
I have always obeyed what he SYN commanded; I have treasured the words that he has spoken. 
“He never changes. There is no one who can RHQ stop him from doing what he desires. Whatever he wants to do, he does. 
And he will finish doing for me the things that he has planned for me; and I am sure that he has thought about doing many things for me. 
So I am terrified in his presence; when I think about what he can do, I am very afraid DOU. 
Almighty God has caused me SYN to feel terrified DOU. 
It is as though there is only thick darkness in front of me, but it is God that I am afraid of, not the darkness.”
