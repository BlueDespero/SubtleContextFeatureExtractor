PSALMS.
Chapter 130.
Yahweh, I have a lot of troubles/many difficulties, so I call out to you. 
Yahweh, hear me, while I call out to you SYN to be merciful to me! 
Yahweh, if you kept a record of the sins that we have committed, not one of us RHQ would escape from being condemned and punished 
But you forgive us, with the result that we greatly revere you. 
Yahweh has said that he would help/rescue me; I trust what he said, and I wait eagerly for him to do that. 
I wait for Yahweh to help me more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn; yes, I wait more eagerly than they do! 
You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh will bless us. He will bless us because he faithfully loves us, and he is very willing to save/rescue us. 
And he will save us Israeli people from being punished for all the sins that we have committed.
