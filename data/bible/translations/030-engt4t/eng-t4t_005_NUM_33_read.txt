NUMBERS.
Chapter 33.
Here is a list of the places where the/we Israelis went as Aaron and Moses/I led them/us after they/we left Egypt. 
Yahweh commanded Moses/me to write down the names of the places where they/we went. 
On the fifteenth day of the first month of the year, the day after we celebrated the ◄Passover/the time when Yahweh killed all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt►, they/we left Rameses city in Egypt and marched boldly while the Egyptian army was coming behind them/us. 
As they/we left, the people of Egypt were still burying the bodies of their firstborn sons. By killing them, Yahweh showed that the gods that the people of Egypt worshiped were false gods. 
After leaving Rameses, they/we first went to Succoth and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Succoth and went to Etham, at the edge of the desert, and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Etham and returned to Pi-Hahiroth, to the east of Baal-Zephon, and set up their/our tents near Migdol. 
Then they/we left Pi-Hahiroth and walked through the Red Sea into the Etham Desert, and set their/our tents at Marah. 
Then they/we left Marah and went to Elim. There were twelve springs and 70 palm trees there. They/We set up our tents there. 
Then they/we left Elim and went to the area near the Red Sea and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left the Red Sea area and went to the area near the Sin Desert and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left the Sin Desert and went to Dophkah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Dophkah and went to Alush and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Alush and went and set up their/our tents at Rephidim, where they/we had no water to drink. 
Then they/we left Rephidim and went to the Sinai Desert and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left the Sinai Desert and went to Kibroth-Hattaavah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Kibroth-Hattaavah and went to Hazeroth and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Hazeroth and went to Rithmah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Rithmah and went to Rimmon-Perez and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Rimmon-Perez and went to Libnah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Libnah and went to Rissah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Rissah and set up their/our tents at Kehelathah. 
Then they/we left Kehelathah and went to Shepher Mountain and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Shepher and went to Haradah Mountain and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Haradah and went to Makheloth and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Makheloth and went to Tahath and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Tahath and went to Terah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Terah and went to Mithcah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Mithcah and went to Hashmonah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Hashmonah and went to Moseroth and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Moseroth and went to Bene-Jaakan and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Bene-Jaakan and went to Hor-Haggidgad and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Hor-Haggidgad and went to Jotbathah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Jotbathah and went to Abronah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Abronah and went to Ezion-Geber and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Ezion-Geber and went to Zin Desert and set up their/our tents at Kadesh there. 
Then they/we left Kadesh and went to Hor Mountain, at the border of Edom land and set up their/our tents there. 
Aaron, the priest, obeyed Yahweh and climbed up the mountain. There he died, on the first day of their/our fifth month, 40 years after the/we Israelis left Egypt. 
Aaron was 123 years old when he died. 
(That was when the king of Arad city heard that the/we Israelis were coming. Arad was in the southern part of Canaan, where the Canaan people-group lived.) 
The Israelis left Hor Mountain and went to Zalmonah and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Zalmonah and went to Punon and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Punon and went to Oboth and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Oboth and went to Iye-Abarim, which was on the border of the Moab region, and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Iye-Abarim and went to Dibon-Gad and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left Dibon-Gad and set up their/our tents at Almon-Diblathaim. 
Then they/we left Almon-Diblathaim and went to the Abarim Mountains, near Nebo and set up their/our tents there. 
Then they/we left the Abarim Mountains and went to the plains of the Moab region, near the Jordan River, across from Jericho. 
They/We set up our tents there; their/our tents stretched for several miles/km. from Beth-Jeshimoth to Acacia. 
While we were there on the plains of the Moab region near the Jordan River, across from Jericho, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me. He said, 
“Tell this to the Israeli people: When you cross the Jordan River and enter the Canaan region, 
you must force all the people who live there to leave. Destroy all their carved statues and all their idols made of metal. Wreck all the places where they worship their idols. 
Take their land from them and start to live there, because I have given their land to you for you to own. 
“ivide up the land by throwing ◄lots/small stones which have been marked► to decide which group will get which area. Give the larger areas to the groups that have more people, and give the smaller areas to the groups that have fewer people. Each tribe will receive its own land. 
If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have much trouble. They will be like sharp hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living. 
And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.”
