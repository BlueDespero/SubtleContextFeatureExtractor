Psalms.
Chapter 46.
One of the songs of the Korah mob, for the leader of music at God’s ceremony house. God is strong and is always ready to help us when we get trouble. He is like a safe place for us to hide. Whenever we get trouble, he is the one that can help us. 
So we will never get frightened. Even if there is a big earthquake, and the mountains start to break up and fall into the sea, even then we will not be frightened. 
Even if the waves in the sea get really big and loud, and if the mountains shake, even then we will not be frightened. 
There is a river in God’s city, and it makes the people there happy. That place is God’s home. He is the greatest one of all. 
God lives in that city. Nothing can ever knock it down. God will stop anybody from hurting the people in that city. He will look after them all the time, right from the start of every day. 
You see, God is powerful, and he frightens the nations that don’t follow him. So they go wild and don’t think properly, and they get weak and useless. It’s like God just yells at those people and they finish up, like ice that melts in the hot sun. 
God is the boss of everything, and he is with us and helps us. He is the God of us Israel people, and he will stop anyone from hurting us. 
Come and look at what God does. He does things on the earth that will shock you. 
He stops wars all over the world. It’s like he breaks all the things that people use to fight with, like their spears and bows, and it’s like he burns all the shields with fire. 
God says, “Stop, you mob. Keep still, and think, and you will know that I am the only one that really is God. The people in every nation will respect me. People all over the world will respect me.” 
God is the boss of everything, and he is with us and helps us. He is the God of us Israel people, and he will stop anyone from hurting us.
