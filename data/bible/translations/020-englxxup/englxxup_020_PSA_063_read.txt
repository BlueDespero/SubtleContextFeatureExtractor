Psalms.
Chapter 63.
For the end, a Psalm of David. 
Hear my prayer, O God, when I make my petition to thee; Deliver my soul from fear of the enemy. 
Thou hast sheltered me from the conspiracy of them that do wickedly; From the multitude of them that work iniquity; 
Who have sharpened their tongues as a sword; They have bent their bow maliciously; 
To shoot in secret at the blameless; They will shoot him suddenly, and will not fear. 
They have set up for themselves an evil matter, They have given counsel to hide snares; They have said, Who shall see them? 
They have searched out iniquity; They have wearied themselves with searching diligently, A man shall approach and the heart is deep, 
And God shall be exalted, Their wounds were caused by the weapon of the foolish children, 
And their tongues have set him at nought, All that saw them were troubled; 
And every man was alarmed, And they related the works of God, And understood his deeds. 
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and hope on him, And all the upright in heart shall be praised.
