Kings IV.
Chapter 14.
In the second year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, did Amaziah also the son of Joash the king of Judah begin to reign. 
Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 
And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not as David his father: he did according to all things that his father Joash did. 
Only he removed not the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 
And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants that had slain the king his father. 
But he slew not the sons of those that had slain him; according as it is written in the book of the laws of Moses, as the Lord gave commandment, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the children shall not be put to death for the fathers; but every one shall die for his own sins. 
He smote of Edom ten thousand in the Valley of Salt, and took the Rock in the war, and called its name Joktheel until this day. 
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 
And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give my daughter to thy son to wife: and the wild beasts of the field that were in Lebanon passed by and trod down the thistle. 
Thou hast smitten and wounded Edom, and thy heart has lifted thee up: stay at home and glorify thyself; for wherefore art thou quarrelsome to thy hurt? So both thou wilt fall and Judah with thee. 
Nevertheless Amaziah hearkened not: so Jehoash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face in Beth-shemesh of Judah. 
And Judah was overthrown before Israel, and every man fled to his tent. 
And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, in Beth-shemesh; and he came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, beginning at the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits. 
And he took the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria. 
And the rest of the acts of Jehoash, even all that he did in his might, how he warred with Amaziah king of Judah, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. 
And Amaziah the son of Jehoash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 
And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish: and they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 
And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 
And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, and he was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 
He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers. 
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah began Jeroboam son of Joash to reign over Israel in Samaria forty and one years. 
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who led Israel to sin. 
He recovered the coast of Israel from the entering in of Hamath to the Sea of Arabah, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet of Gath-hepher. 
For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, and that they were few in number, straitened and in want, and destitute, and Israel had no helper. 
And the Lord said that he would not blot out the seed of Israel from under heaven; so he delivered them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. 
And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, which he achieved in war, and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.
