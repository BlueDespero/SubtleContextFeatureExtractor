Psalms.
Chapter 94.
The praise of a Song by David. Come, let us exult in the Lord; Let us make a joyful noise to God our Savior. 
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, And make a joyful noise to him with psalms. 
For the Lord is a great God, And a great king over all gods: For the Lord will not cast off his people. 
For the ends of the earth are in his hands; And the heights of the mountains are his. 
For the sea is his, and he made it: And his hands formed the dry land. 
Come, let us worship and fall down before him; And weep before the Lord that made us. 
For he is our God; And we are the people of his pasture, And the sheep of his hand. 
Today, if ye will hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, According to the day of irritation in the wilderness: 
Where your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my works. 
Forty years was I grieved with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart, And they have not known my ways. 
So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
