Psalms.
Chapter 21.
For the end, concerning the morning aid, a Psalm of David. 
O God, my God, attend to me: why hast thou forsaken me? The account of my transgressions is far from my salvation. 
O my God, I will cry to thee by day, but thou wilt not hear: And by night, and it shall not be accounted for folly to me. 
But thou, the praise of Israel, dwellest in a sanctuary. 
Our fathers hoped in thee; They hoped, and thou didst deliver them. 
They cried to thee, and were saved: They hoped in thee, and were not ashamed. 
But I am a worm, and not a man; A reproach of men, and scorn of the people. 
All that saw me mocked me: They spoke with their lips, they shook the head, saying, 
He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him, Let him save him, because he takes pleasure in him. 
For thou art he that drew me out of the womb; My hope from my mother’s breasts. 
I was cast on thee from the womb: Thou art my God from my mother’s belly. 
Stand not aloof from me; for affliction is near; For there is no helper. 
Many bullocks have compassed me: Fat bulls have beset me round. 
They have opened their mouth against me, As a ravening and roaring lion. 
I am poured out like water, And all my bones are loosened: My heart in the midst of my belly is become like melting wax. 
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue is glued to my throat; And thou hast brought me down to the dust of death. 
For many dogs have compassed me: The assembly of the wicked doers has beset me round: They pierced my hands and my feet. 
They counted all my bones; And they observed and looked upon me. 
They parted my garments among themselves, And cast lots upon my raiment. 
But thou, O Lord, remove not my help afar off: Be ready for mine aid. 
Deliver my soul from the sword; My only begotten one from the power of the dog. 
Save me from the lion’s mouth; And regard my lowliness from the horns of the unicorns. 
I will declare thy name to my brethren: In the midst of the church will I sing praise to thee. 
Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; All ye seed of Jacob, glorify him: Let all the seed of Israel fear him. 
For he has not despised nor been angry at the supplication of the poor; Nor turned away his face from me; But when I cried to him, he heard me. 
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. 
The poor shall eat and be satisfied; And they shall praise the Lord that seek him: Their heart shall live forever. 
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord: And all the kindred of the nations shall worship before him. 
For the kingdom is the Lord’s; And he is the governor of the nations. 
All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and worshiped: All that go down to the earth shall fall down before him: My soul also lives to him. 
And my seed shall serve him: The generation that is coming shall be reported to the Lord. 
And they shall report his righteousness To the people that shall be born, whom the Lord has made.
