Jonah.
Chapter 3.
And the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, saying, 
Rise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach in it according to the former preaching which I spoke to thee of. 
And Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, as the Lord had spoken. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of about three days’ journey. 
And Jonah began to enter into the city about a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. 
And the men of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them. 
And the word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from off his throne, and took off his raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes. 
And proclamation was made, and it was commanded in Nineveh by the king and by his great men, saying, Let not men, or cattle, or oxen, or sheep, taste anything, nor feed, nor drink water. 
So men and cattle were clothed with sackcloth, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying, 
Who knows if God will repent, and turn from his fierce anger, and so we shall not perish? 
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did it not.
