Song of Solomon.
Chapter 4.
Behold, thou art fair, my companion; Behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are doves, Beside thy veil: Thy hair is as flocks of goats, That have appeared from Gilead. 
Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn sheep, That have gone up from the washing; All of them bearing twins, And there is not a barren one among them. 
Thy lips are as a thread of scarlet, And thy speech is comely: Like the rind of a pomegranate Is thy cheek without thy veil. 
Thy neck is as the tower of David, That was built for an armory: A thousand shields hang upon it, And all darts of mighty men. 
Thy two breasts are as two twin fawns, That feed among the lilies. 
Until the day dawn, and the shadows depart, I will betake me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense. 
Thou art all fair, my companion, And there is no spot in thee. 
Come from Lebanon, my bride, come from Lebanon: Thou shalt come and pass from the top of Faith, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 
My sister, my spouse, Thou hast ravished my heart; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck. 
How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! How much more beautiful are thy breasts than wine, And the smell of thy garments than all spices! 
Thy lips drop honeycomb, my spouse: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is as the smell of Lebanon. 
My sister, my spouse is a garden enclosed; A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed. 
Thy shoots are a garden of pomegranates, with the fruit of choice berries; Camphor, with spikenard: 
Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon; With all woods of Lebanon, Myrrh, aloes, with all chief spices: 
A fountain of a garden, And a well of water springing and gurgling from Lebanon. 
Awake, O north wind; and come, O south; And blow through my garden, and let my spices flow out.
