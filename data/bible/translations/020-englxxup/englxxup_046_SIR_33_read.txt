Sirach.
Chapter 33.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord God of all, and behold us: 
And send thy fear upon all the nations that seek not after thee. 
Lift up thy hand against the strange nations, And let them see thy power. 
As thou wast sanctified in us before them: So be thou magnified among them before us. 
And let them know thee, as we have known thee, That there is no God but only thou, O God. 
Show new signs, and make other strange wonders: Glorify thy hand and thy right arm, That they may set forth thy wondrous works. 
Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath: Take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy. 
Make the time short, remember the covenant, And let them declare thy wonderful works. 
Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire; And let them perish that oppress the people. 
Smite in sunder the heads of the rulers of the heathen, That say, There is none other but we. 
Gather all the tribes of Jacob together. 
A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and diet.
