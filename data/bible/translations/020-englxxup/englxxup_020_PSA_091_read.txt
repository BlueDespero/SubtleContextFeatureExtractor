Psalms.
Chapter 91.
A Psalm of a Song for the Sabbath day. 
It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, And to sing praises to thy name, O thou Most High; 
To proclaim thy mercy in the morning, And thy truth by night, 
On a psaltery of ten strings, with a song on the harp. 
For thou, O Lord, hast made me glad with thy work: And in the operations of thy hands will I exult. 
How have thy works been magnified, O Lord! Thy thoughts are very deep. 
A foolish man will not know, And a senseless man will not understand this. 
When the sinners spring up as the grass, And all the workers of iniquity have watched; It is that they may be utterly destroyed forever. 
But thou, O Lord, art most high forever. 
For, behold, thine enemies shall perish; And all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
But my horn shall be exalted as the horn of a unicorn; And mine old age with rich mercy. 
And mine eye has seen mine enemies, And mine ear shall hear the wicked that rise up against me. 
The righteous shall flourish as a palm tree: He shall be increased as the cedar in Lebanon. 
They that are planted in the house of the Lord Shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
Then shall they be increased in a fine old age; And they shall be prosperous; That they may declare 
that the Lord my God is righteous, And there is no iniquity in him.
