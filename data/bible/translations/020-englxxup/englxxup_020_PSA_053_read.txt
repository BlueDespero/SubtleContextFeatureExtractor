Psalms.
Chapter 53.
For the end, among the Hymns of instruction by David, 
when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Lo, is not David hidden with us? 
Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me by thy might. 
O God, hear my prayer; Hearken to the words of my mouth. 
For strangers have risen up against me, And mighty men have sought my life: They have not set God before them. Pause. 
For lo! God assists me; And the Lord is the helper of my soul. 
He shall return evil to mine enemies; Utterly destroy them in thy truth. 
I will willingly sacrifice to thee: I will give thanks to thy name, O Lord; for it is good. 
For thou hast delivered me out of all affliction, And mine eye has seen my desire upon mine enemies.
