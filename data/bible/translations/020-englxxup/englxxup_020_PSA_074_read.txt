Psalms.
Chapter 74.
For the end, Destroy not, a Psalm of a Song for Asaph. 
We will give thanks to thee, O God, We will give thanks, and call upon thy name: I will declare all thy wonderful works. 
When I shall take a set time, I will judge righteously. 
The earth is dissolved, and all that dwell in it: I have strengthened its pillars. Pause. 
I said unto the transgressors, Do not transgress; And to the sinners, Lift not up the horn. 
Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not unrighteousness against God. 
For good comes neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert mountains. 
For God is the judge; He puts down one, and raises up another. 
For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, Full of unmingled wine; And he has turned it from side to side, But its dregs have not been wholly poured out; All the sinners of the earth shall drink them. 
But I will exult forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
And I will break all the horns of sinners; But the horns of the righteous one shall be exalted.
