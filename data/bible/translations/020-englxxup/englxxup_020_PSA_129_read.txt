Psalms.
Chapter 129.
A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Lord. 
O Lord, hearken to my voice; Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplication. 
If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
For with thee is forgiveness: For thy name’s sake 
have I waited for thee, O Lord, My soul has waited for thy word. 
My soul has hoped in the Lord; From the morning watch till night. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord: For with the Lord is mercy, And with him is plenteous redemption. 
And he shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
