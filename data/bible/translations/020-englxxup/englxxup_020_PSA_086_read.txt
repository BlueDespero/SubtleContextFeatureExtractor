Psalms.
Chapter 86.
A Psalm of a Song for the sons of Korah. His foundations are in the holy mountains. 
The Lord loves the gates of Zion, More than all the tabernacles of Jacob. 
Glorious things have been spoken of thee, O city of God. Pause. 
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: Behold also the Philistines, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: These were born there. 
A man shall say, Zion is my mother; And such a man was born in her; And the Highest himself has founded her. 
The Lord shall recount it in the writing of the people, And of these princes that were born in her. Pause. 
The dwelling of all within thee is as the dwelling of those that rejoice.
