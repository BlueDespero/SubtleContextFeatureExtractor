Jonah.
Chapter 2.
Now the Lord had commanded a great whale to swallow up Jonah: and Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights. 
And Jonah prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the whale, 
and said, I cried in my affliction to the Lord my God, and he hearkened to me, Even to my cry out of the belly of hell: thou heardest my voice. 
Thou didst cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me: All thy billows and thy waves have passed upon me. 
And I said, I am cast out of thy presence: Shall I indeed look again toward thy holy temple? 
Water was poured around me to the soul: The lowest deep compassed me, My head went down 
to the clefts of the mountains; I went down into the earth, whose bars are the everlasting barriers: Yet, O Lord my God, let my ruined life be restored. 
When my soul was failing me, I remembered the Lord; And may my prayer come to thee into thy holy temple. 
They that observe vanities and lies have forsaken their own mercy. 
But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise and thanksgiving: All that I have vowed I will pay to thee, the Lord of my salvation. 
And the whale was commanded by the Lord, and it cast up Jonah on the dry land.
