Esther (Greek).
Chapter 7.
So the king and Haman went in to drink with the queen. 
And the king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, What is it, queen Esther? and what is thy request, and what is thy petition? and it shall be done for thee, to the half of my kingdom. 
And she answered and said, If I have found favor in the sight of the king, let my life be granted to my petition, and my people to my request. 
For both I and my people are sold for destruction, and pillage, and slavery; both we and our children for bondmen and bondwomen: and I consented not to it, for the slanderer is not worthy of the king’s palace. 
And the king said, Who is this that has dared to do this thing? 
And Esther said, The adversary is Haman, this wicked man. Then Haman was troubled before the king and the queen. 
And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Haman began to entreat the queen; for he saw that he was in an evil case. 
And the king returned from the garden; and Haman had fallen upon the bed, entreating the queen. And the king said, Wilt thou even force my wife in my house? And when Haman heard it, he changed countenance. 
And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Haman has also prepared a gallows for Mordecai, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Haman. And the king said, Let him be hanged thereon. 
So Haman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordecai: and then the king’s wrath was appeased.
