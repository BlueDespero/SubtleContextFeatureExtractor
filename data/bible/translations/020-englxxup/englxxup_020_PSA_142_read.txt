Psalms.
Chapter 142.
A Psalm of David, when his son pursued him. O Lord, attend to my prayer: Hearken to my supplication in thy truth; Hear me in thy righteousness. 
And enter not into judgment with thy servant, For in thy sight shall no man living be justified. 
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has brought my life down to the ground; He has made me to dwell in a dark place, as those that have been long dead. 
Therefore my spirit was grieved in me; My heart was troubled within me. 
I remembered the days of old; And I meditated on all thy doings: Yea, I meditated on the works of thy hands. 
I spread forth my hands to thee; My soul thirsts for thee, as a dry land. Pause. 
Hear me speedily, O Lord; My spirit has failed; Turn not away thy face from me, Else I shall be like to them that go down to the pit. 
Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; For I have hoped in thee; Make known to me, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk; For I have lifted up my soul to thee. 
Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord; For I have fled to thee for refuge. 
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God; Thy good Spirit shall guide me in the straight way. 
Thou shalt quicken me, O Lord, for thy name’s sake; In thy righteousness thou shalt bring my soul out of affliction. 
And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy mine enemies, And wilt destroy all those that afflict my soul; For I am thy servant.
