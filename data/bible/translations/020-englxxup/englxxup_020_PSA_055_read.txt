Psalms.
Chapter 55.
For the end, concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary, by David for a memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath. 
Have mercy upon me, O God; for man has trodden me down; All the day long he warring has afflicted me. 
Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day from the dawning of the day; For there are many warring against me. 
They shall be afraid, but I will trust in thee. 
In God I will praise my words; All the day have I hoped in God; I will not fear what flesh shall do to me. 
All the day long they have abominated my words; All their devices are against me for evil. 
They will dwell near and hide themselves; They will watch my steps, Accordingly as I have waited patiently in my soul. 
Thou wilt on no account save them; Thou wilt bring down the people in wrath. 
O God, I have declared my life to thee; Thou hast set my tears before thee, even according to thy promise. 
Mine enemies shall be turned back, In the day wherein I shall call upon thee; Behold, I know that thou art my God. 
In God will I praise his word; In the Lord will I praise his saying. 
I have hoped in God; I will not be afraid of what man shall do to me. 
The vows of thy praise, O God, which I will pay, are upon me. 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, And my feet from sliding, That I should be well-pleasing before God in the land of the living.
