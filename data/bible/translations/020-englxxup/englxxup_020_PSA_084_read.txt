Psalms.
Chapter 84.
For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Korah. 
O Lord, thou hast taken pleasure in thy land: Thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob. 
Thou hast forgiven thy people their transgressions; Thou hast covered all their sins. Pause. 
Thou hast caused all thy wrath to cease: Thou hast turned from thy fierce anger. 
Turn us, O God of our salvation, And turn thine anger away from us. 
Wouldest thou be angry with us forever? Or wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation? 
O God, thou wilt turn and quicken us; And thy people shall rejoice in thee. 
Show us thy mercy, O Lord, And grant us thy salvation. 
I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: For he shall speak peace to his people, And to his saints, And to those that turn their heart toward him. 
Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; That glory may dwell in our land. 
Mercy and truth are met together: Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 
Truth has sprung out of the earth; And righteousness has looked down from heaven. 
For the Lord will give goodness; And our land shall yield her fruit. 
Righteousness shall go before him; And shall set his steps in the way.
