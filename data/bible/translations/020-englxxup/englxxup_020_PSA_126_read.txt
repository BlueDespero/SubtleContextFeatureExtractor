Psalms.
Chapter 126.
A Song of Degrees. Except the Lord build the house, They that build labor in vain: Except the Lord keep the city, The watchman watches in vain. 
It is vain for you to rise early: Ye rise up after resting, Ye that eat the bread of grief; While he gives sleep to his beloved. 
Behold, the inheritance of the Lord, children, The reward of the fruit of the womb. 
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; So are the children of those who were outcasts. 
Blessed is the man who shall satisfy his desire with them: They shall not be ashamed when they shall speak to their enemies in the gates.
