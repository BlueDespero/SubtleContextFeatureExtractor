Psalms.
Chapter 95.
When the house was built after the Captivity, a Song by David. Sing to the Lord a new song; Sing to the Lord, all the earth. 
Sing to the Lord, bless his name: Proclaim his salvation from day to day. 
Publish his glory among the Gentiles, His wonderful works among all people. 
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: He is terrible above all gods. 
For all the gods of the heathen are devils: But the Lord made the heavens. 
Thanksgiving and beauty are before him: Holiness and majesty are in his sanctuary. 
Bring to the Lord, ye families of the Gentiles, Bring to the Lord glory and honor. 
Bring to the Lord the glory becoming his name: Take offerings, and go into his courts. 
Worship the Lord in his holy court: Let all the earth tremble before him. 
Say among the heathen, The Lord reigns: For he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: He shall judge the people in righteousness. 
Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; Let the sea be moved, and the fullness of it. 
The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: Then shall all the trees of the wood exult Before the presence of the Lord: 
for he comes, For he comes to judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, And the people with his truth.
