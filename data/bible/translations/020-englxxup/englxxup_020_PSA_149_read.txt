Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Alleluia. Sing to the Lord a new song: His praise is in the assembly of the saints. 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; And let the children of Zion exult in their king. 
Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises to him with timbrel and psaltery. 
For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; And will exalt the meek with salvation. 
The saints shall rejoice in glory; And shall exult on their beds. 
The high praises of God shall be in their throat, And two-edged swords in their hands; 
To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishments among the peoples; 
To bind their kings with fetters, And their nobles with manacles of iron; 
To execute on them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints.
