Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Alleluia, a Psalm of Haggai and Zechariah. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: Praise him in the highest. 
Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his hosts. 
Praise him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars and light. 
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And the water that is above the heavens. 
Let them praise the name of the Lord: For he spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created. 
He has established them forever, even forever and ever: He has made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away. 
Praise the Lord from the earth, Ye serpents, and all deeps. 
Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy wind; The things that perform his word. 
Mountains, and all hills; Fruitful trees, and all cedars: 
Wild beasts, and all cattle; Reptiles, and winged birds: 
Kings of the earth, and all peoples; Princes, and all judges of the earth: 
Young men and virgins, Old men with youths: 
Let them praise the name of the Lord: For his name only is exalted; His praise is above the earth and heaven, 
And he shall exalt the horn of his people, There is a hymn for all his saints, Even of the children of Israel, a people who draw near to him.
