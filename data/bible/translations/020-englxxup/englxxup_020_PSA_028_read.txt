Psalms.
Chapter 28.
A Psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle. Bring to the Lord, ye sons of God, Bring to the Lord young rams; Bring to the Lord glory and honor. 
Bring to the Lord glory, due to his name; Worship the Lord in his holy court. 
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: The God of glory has thundered: The Lord is upon many waters. 
The voice of the Lord is mighty; The voice of the Lord is full of majesty. 
There is the voice of the Lord who breaks the cedars; The Lord will break the cedars of Lebanon. 
And he will beat them small, even Lebanon itself, like a calf; And the beloved one is as a young unicorn. 
There is a voice of the Lord who divides a flame of fire. 
A voice of the Lord who shakes the wilderness; The Lord will shake the wilderness of Kadesh. 
The voice of the Lord strengthens the hinds, And will uncover the thickets: And in his temple everyone speaks of his glory. 
The Lord will dwell on the waterflood: And the Lord will sit a king forever. 
The Lord will give strength to his people; The Lord will bless his people with peace.
