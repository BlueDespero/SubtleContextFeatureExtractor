Psalms.
Chapter 137.
A Psalm for David, of Haggai and Zechariah. I will give thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart; And I will sing psalms to thee before the angels; For thou hast heard all the words of my mouth. 
I will worship toward thy holy temple, And give thanks to thy name, On account of thy mercy and thy truth; For thou hast magnified thy holy name above everything. 
In whatsoever day I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily; Thou shalt abundantly provide me with thy power in my soul. 
Let all the kings of the earth, O Lord, give thanks unto thee; For they have heard all the words of thy mouth. 
And let them sing in the ways of the Lord; For great is the glory of the Lord. 
For the Lord is high, and yet regards the lowly; And he knows high things from afar off. 
Though I should walk in the midst of affliction, thou wilt quicken me; Thou hast stretched forth thy hands against the wrath of mine enemies, And thy right hand has saved me. 
O Lord, thou shalt recompense them on my behalf: Thy mercy, O Lord, endures forever: Overlook not the works of thy hands.
