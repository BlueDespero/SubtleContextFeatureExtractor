Psalms.
Chapter 59.
For the end, for them that shall yet be changed; for an inscription by David for instruction, 
when he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syria Zobah, and Joab had returned and smitten in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. 
O God, thou hast rejected and destroyed us; Thou hast been angry, yet hast pitied us. 
Thou hast shaken the earth, and troubled it; Heal its breaches, for it has been shaken. 
Thou hast shown thy people hard things: Thou hast made us drink the wine of astonishment. 
Thou hast given a token to them that fear thee, That they might flee from the bow. Pause. 
That thy beloved ones may be delivered; Save with thy right hand, and hear me. 
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, and divide Shechem, And measure out the Valley of Tents. 
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; And Ephraim is the strength of my head; 
Judah is my king; Moab is the caldron of my hope; Over Edom will I stretch out my shoe; The Philistines have been subjected to me. 
Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will guide me as far as Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our forces? 
Give us help from trouble: For vain is the deliverance of man. 
In God will we do valiantly; And he shall bring to nought them that harass us.
