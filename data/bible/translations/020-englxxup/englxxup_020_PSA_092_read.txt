Psalms.
Chapter 92.
For the day before the Sabbath, when the land was first inhabited, the praise of a Song by David. The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honor: The Lord has clothed and girded himself with strength; For he has established the world, which shall not be moved. 
Thy throne is prepared of old: Thou art from everlasting. 
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, The rivers have lifted up their voices, 
At the voices of many waters: The billows of the sea are wonderful: The Lord is wonderful in high places. 
Thy testimonies are made very sure: Holiness becomes thy house, O Lord, forever.
