Job.
Chapter 23.
Then Job answered and said, 
Yea, I know that pleading is out of my reach; And his hand has been made heavy upon my groaning. 
Who would then know that I might find him, And come to an end of the matter? 
And I would plead my own cause, And he would fill my mouth with arguments. 
And I would know the remedies which he would speak to me, And I would perceive what he would tell me. 
Though he should come on me in his great strength, Then he would not threaten me; 
For truth and reproof are from him; And he would bring forth my judgment to an end. 
For if I shall go first, and exist no longer, Still what do I know concerning the latter end? 
When he wrought on the left hand, then I observed it not: His right hand shall encompass me but I shall not see it. 
For he knows already my way; And he has tried me as gold. 
And I will go forth according to his commandments, For I have kept his ways; and I shall not turn aside from his commandments, 
Neither shall I transgress; But I have hidden his words in my bosom. 
And if too he has thus judged, who is he that has contradicted, For he has both willed a thing and done it. 
Therefore am I troubled at him; And when I was reproved, I thought of him. 
Therefore let me take good heed before him: I will consider, and be afraid of him. 
But the Lord has softened my heart, And the Almighty has troubled me. 
For I knew not that darkness would come upon me, And thick darkness has covered me before my face.
