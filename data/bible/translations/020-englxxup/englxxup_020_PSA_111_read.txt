Psalms.
Chapter 111.
Alleluia. Blessed is the man that fears the Lord: He will delight greatly in his commandments. 
His seed shall be mighty in the earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed. 
Glory and riches shall be in his house; And his righteousness endures for evermore. 
To the upright light has sprung up in darkness: He is pitiful, and merciful, and righteous. 
The good man is he that pities and lends: He will direct his affairs with judgment. 
For he shall not be moved forever; The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. 
He shall not be afraid of any evil report: His heart is ready to trust in the Lord. 
His heart is established, he shall not fear, Till he shall see his desire upon his enemies. 
He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor; His righteousness endures for evermore: His horn shall be exalted with honor. 
The sinner shall see and be angry, He shall gnash his teeth, and consume away: The desire of the sinner shall perish.
