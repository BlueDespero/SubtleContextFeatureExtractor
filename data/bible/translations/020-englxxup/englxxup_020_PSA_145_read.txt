Psalms.
Chapter 145.
Alleluia, a Psalm of Haggai and Zechariah. My soul, praise the Lord. 
While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 
Trust not in princes, Nor in the children of men, in whom there is no safety. 
His breath shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth; In that day all his thoughts shall perish. 
Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob, Whose hope is in the Lord his God: 
Who made heaven, and earth, The sea, and all things in them: Who keeps truth forever: 
Who executes judgment for the wronged: Who gives food to the hungry. The Lord looses the fettered ones: 
The Lord gives wisdom to the blind: The Lord sets up the broken down: The Lord loves the righteous: The Lord preserves the strangers; 
He will relieve the orphan and widow: But will utterly remove the way of sinners. 
The Lord shall reign forever, Even thy God, O Zion, to all generations.
