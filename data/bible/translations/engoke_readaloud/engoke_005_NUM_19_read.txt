Numbers.
Chapter 19.
And the Lord spake with Mosheh and to Aharon, saying: 
This is the decree of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying: Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring to thee a red heifer, unblemished, with no spot in her, and upon which no yoke hath been put. 
And you shall give her unto Elazar the priest, that he may bring her without the camp, and (one) shall slaughter her before him. 
And Elazar, the priest, shall take (some) of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood against the face of the tabernacle of ordinance seven times. 
And (one) shall burn the heifer before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her food shall he burn. 
And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
And the priest shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterwards come into the camp: but the priest shall be unclean until the evening. 
And he who burneth her shall wash his clothes with water, and bathe his flesh in water, and be unclean until evening. 
And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel to keep, for the sprinkling with water; it is (a purification) for sin. 
And he who gathereth up the ashes of the heifer shall wash his raiment, and be unclean until the evening; and it shall be for the children of Israel, and for the strangers who dwell among you, a statute forever. 
Whosoever toucheth the dead of any of mankind shall be unclean seven days. 
He shall sprinkle with it on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean; but if he sprinkle it not on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. 
Whoever toucheth the dead body of a man who hath died, and sprinkleth not with it, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that man shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling is not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean, (for) his uncleanness is yet upon him. 
This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: everyone who entereth the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
And every open earthen vessel which hath not a covering fastened upon it round about is unclean. 
And whoever toucheth one who is slain with the sword upon the face of the field, or a dead body, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 
And for the unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt sin offering, and put spring water upon it in a vessel. 
And a man who is clean shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle upon the tent, and upon every vessel, and upon the persons who are there, and upon him who had touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead body, or the grave. 
And the clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall be clean; and shall sprinkle his raiment, and wash with water, and at the evening he shall be clean. 
But the man who is unclean, and it bath not been sprinkled upon him, shall be cut off from the congregation, because he would defile the sanctuary of the Lord. The water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 
And it shall be to them for an everlasting statute, that he who applieth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes, and whoever toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until the evening; 
And whatever may be touched by the unclean person shall be unclean, and the man who toucheth it shall be unclean until the evening.
