Leviticus.
Chapter 10.
But the sons of Aharon, Nadab and Abihu, took each man his censer and put fire in them, and put sweet incense upon it, and offered (or brought) before the Lord strange fire which He had not commanded them. 
And fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. 
And Mosheh said unto Aharon, This is that which the Lord spake, saying, In them who approacheth Me I will be sanctified, and in the face of all the people will I be glorified. And Aharon was silent. 
And Mosheh called to Mishael and to Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aharon, and said to them, Come nigh, and carry your brethren from before the sanctuary without the camp. 
And they came nigh, and carried them in their vestments out of the camp, as Mosheh had spoken. 
And Mosheh said to Aharon and to Elazar and to Ithamar his sons, Make not bare your heads, nor rend your garments, lest you die, and wrath be upon all the congregation; but let your brethren and all the house of Israel bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled; 
And go not forth from the door of the tabernacle of ordinance, lest you die; for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you. And they did according to the word of Mosheh. 
And the Lord spake unto Aharon, saying: 
Drink not wine nor strong drink, neither thou nor thy sons with thee, when you enter into the tabernacle of ordinance, that you die not. It is an everlasting statute unto your generations, 
For the distinguishment between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 
And that you may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken to them through Mosheh. 
And Mosheh spake with Aharon and with Elazar and with Ithamar his sons who were left: Take the mincha which remaineth of the oblations of the Lord, and eat it unleavened at the side of the altar, because it is most holy. 
It shall be eaten in the holy place; for it is thy portion, and the portion of thy sons of the oblations of the Lord; for so have I been commanded. 
But the breast of the uplifting and the shoulder of the separation you may eat on (any) clean place, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee; for it is thy portion, and the portion of thy sons, which hath been given of the hallowed sacrifices of the children of Israel. 
The shoulder of the separation and the breast of the uplifting they will bring with the oblation of the fat things to uplift, an elevation before the Lord: and they shall be thine and thy sons’ with thee by an everlasting statute, as the Lord hath commanded. 
But Mosheh made inquiry for the goat of the sin offering; and, behold, it had been burned; and he was angry with Elazar and Ithamar the sons of Aharon who were left, saying: 
Why have you not eaten of the sin offering in the holy place, because it is most holy; and He hath delivered it unto you for pardoning mercy upon the sin of the congregation to make atonement for them before the Lord? 
Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the sanctuary: eating you should have eaten it within the holy (precinct), as I had commanded. 
And Aharon said to Mosheh, Behold, this day they have brought their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; but such griefs as these having come upon me, if I had eaten of the sin offering today, would it have been right before the Lord? 
And Mosheh heard, and it was pleasing in his eyes.
