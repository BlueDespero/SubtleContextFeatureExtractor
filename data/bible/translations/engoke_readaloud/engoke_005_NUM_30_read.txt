Numbers.
Chapter 30.
And Mosheh spake to the sons of Israel according to all that the Lord commanded Mosheh. 
And Mosheh spake with the heads of the tribes of the Beni Israel, saying: This is the word which the Lord hath commanded: 
When a man shall make a vow before the Lord, or swear an oath to bind a bond upon his soul, he shall not make void his word; according to all that hath come out of his mouth he shall perform. 
And if a woman make a vow before the Lord, and bind (herself) with a bond in her father’s house, (being) in her youth, 
And her father shall hear her vow, and the obligation she hath bound upon her soul, and her father be silent to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond that she hath bound upon her soul shall be confirmed. 
But if her father prohibit (or undo) them on the day that he heareth, all the vows and the bonds that she hath bound upon her soul shall not stand, and she shall be forgiven before the Lord, because her father undid them. 
And if she hath a husband, and taketh a vow upon her, or if her lips pronounce that which becometh binding upon her soul, 
and her husband heard and was silent to her on the day that he heard, her vows shall stand, and the obligation she hath bound upon her soul be confirmed: 
But if her husband on the day that he heareth shall prohibit them, the vows which are on her and the utterance of her lips which became binding on her soul shall be void, and be forgiven her before the Lord. 
But every vow of the widow, or of one divorced, which she hath bound upon her soul, shall be confirmed upon her. 
And if (while in her husband’s house) she had vowed, or had bound aught upon her soul with an oath, 
And her husband heard and was silent to her, and did not prohibit them, all her vows shall be confirmed, every bond with which she hath bound her soul shall be confirmed. 
But if indeed her husband shall make them void in the day that he heard, that which her lips expressed in her vow and in the binding of her soul shall not be confirmed; her husband hath made them void, and she shall be absolved before the Lord. 
Every vow and every covenant (oath) to chastise the soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void. 
But if her husband was entirely silent to her from day to day, then he hath confirmed all her vows, or whatever bonds (she taketh) upon her, he confirmeth them, because he was silent to her on the day that he heard. 
But if he shall indeed make them void after (the day that) he had heard, then he shall bear her sin. 
These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Mosheh between a man and his wife, (and) between a father and his daughter, in her youth in her father’s house.
