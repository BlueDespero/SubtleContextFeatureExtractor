Deuteronomy.
Chapter 11.
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keeping keep His word, His statutes, His judgments, and His commandments all days. 
And you know this day what your children have not known or seen, the discipline of the Lord your God, His greatness, His mighty hand and uplifted arm, 
His miracles, and His works which He did in Mizraim, to Pharoh king of Mizraim, and to all his land; 
And what He did to the host of the Mizraee, to their horses and their chariots, when he made the waters of the Sea of Suph to overflow their faces as they followed after you, and the Lord destroyed them unto this day; 
And what He did to you in the wilderness until your coming unto this place; 
And what He did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab bar Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up with the men of their house, their tents, and all the substance they had, in the midst of all Israel; 
For your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which He hath wrought. 
You shall observe all the precepts which I command thee this day, that you may be strengthened, and go in and possess the land unto which you are going over to inherit, 
And may prolong your days upon the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give them and their children, a land producing milk and honey; 
For the land into which thou art going to possess it, is not as the land of Mizraim from which thou hast come out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and didst water it with thy feet as a garden of herbs (or a green garden); 
But the land to which thou goest over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, drinking water of the rains of heaven; 
Keep a land which the Lord thy God looketh after; (inquireth for;) the eyes of the Lord thy God are evermore upon it, from the beginning unto the end of the year. 
And it shall be, if you will be diligently obedient to all My commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God, and to serve before Him with all most your heart, and with all your soul, 
I will give you the rain of your land in its season, the early and the latter; and thou shalt gather in thy corn, thy wine, and thy oil; 
And I will give herbage in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. 
Take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside to serve the gods of the Gentiles and worship them; 
And the anger of the Lord be aroused against you, and He shut up the skies that there be no rain, and the earth yield not her fruit, and you perish soon from off the good land which the Lord will give you: 
But lay these my words upon your heart, and upon your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and let them be for tephillin between your eyes; 
And teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest in the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up; 
And write them upon the posts, and fix them to the entrance of thy house, and upon thy gates; 
That your days and the days of your children may be multiplied on the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 
For if you surely keep all this precept that I command you to perform it, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all the ways that are right before Him, and keep close unto His fear, 
then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, that you may possess (the lands) of nations greater and stronger than yourselves. 
Every place on which the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours, from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Phrat, unto the uttermost sea shall be your border. 
There shall not a man stand before you; for the Lord your God will put the fear and dread of you upon the face of all the land that you tread upon, as the Lord hath said unto you. 
Behold, I set before you this day blessings and curses: 
Blessings, if you obey the precepts of the Lord your God, which I command you this day; 
But curses, if you obey not the precepts of the Lord your God, and turn aside from the way that I teach you this day, to go after the idols of the peoples whom you have not known. 
And it shall be, when the Lord your God hath brought thee into the land which thou goest to possess, thou shalt set the blessings upon the Mount of Gerizim, and the curses upon the Mountain of Ebal. 
Are they not beyond Jordan, after the way of the sun-setting, in the land of the Kenaanites, which dwell in the plains over against Gilgala, by the side of the plain of Moreh? 
For you are to pass over the Jordan to enter in to inherit the land which the Lord your God will give you; and you will possess, and dwell therein. 
And you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I have set before you this day.
