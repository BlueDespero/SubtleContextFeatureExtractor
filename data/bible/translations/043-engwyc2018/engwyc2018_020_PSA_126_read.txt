Chapter 126.
The song of degrees. When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion; we were made as comforted. (A song for steps of ascending. When the Lord returned the captives to Zion or When the Lord returned prosperity to Zion; we were made like in a dream.) 
Then our mouth was filled with joy; and our tongue with full out joying. Then they shall say among heathen men; The Lord magnified to do with them. (Then our mouths were filled with joy; and ours tongues with rejoicing. And the heathen said to each other, The Lord hath done great things for them.) 
The Lord magnified to do with us; we be made glad. (Yea, the Lord did great things for us; and we were glad.) 
Lord, turn thou (again) our captivity; as a strand in the south. (Lord, return thou the captives or return thou our prosperity; like the streams return to the south.) 
They that sow in tears; shall reap in full out joying. (Then they who sowed in tears; shall reap with rejoicing.) 
They going, went, and wept; sending their seeds. But they coming, shall come with full out joying; bearing their handfuls (They going, went, and wept; sending out their seeds. But when they shall return, they shall come back rejoicing; carrying their harvest.)
