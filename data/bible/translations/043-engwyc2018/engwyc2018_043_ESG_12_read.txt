And when enquiring was had of ever either of them, the king com-manded them, that acknowledged or had confessedtheir treason, to be led to the death.

Forsooth Haman, the son of Ham-medatha, a Bougaean (or an Agagite), was most glorious before the king, and he would have annoyed (or harmed) Mordecai, and his people, for the twain honest (and chaste) servants (or the two eunuchs) of the king that were slain. Hitherto is the proem; those things, that pursue(or that follow), were set in that place where it is written in the book, And they took away the goods, either the chattels of them; which things we found in the common translation. Haman forsooth, the son of Hammedatha, (a) gelding, was most glorious before the king, and would annoy (or do harm) to Mordecai, and his people, for the two geldings of the king that were slain. Hitherto the proem; those things, that follow, in that place were put, where is written in the volume, And they wasted the goods, or their substances; the which only in the common translation we have found.
