APOCALYPSE of JOHN.
Chapter 9.
And the fifth angel trumped; and I saw, that a star had fallen down from (the) heaven(s) into (the) earth; and the key of the pit of deepness was given to it or and the key of the pit of deepness is given to him. 
And it opened the pit of deepness or And he opened the pit of deepness, and a smoke of the pit ascended up, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun was darked, and the air, of the smoke of the pit, (or and the sun, and the air, were darkened by the smoke from the pit). 
And locusts went out of the smoke of the pit into (the) earth; and power was given to them, as scorpions of the earth have power. 
And it was commanded to them, that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only (the) men, that have not the sign of God or the mark of God in their foreheads, (or but only those, who did not have God’s seal upon their foreheads). 
And it was given to them, that they should not slay them, but that they should be tormented (for) five months; and the tormenting of them, (was) as the tormenting of a scorpion, when he smiteth a man (or when he striketh someone). 
And in those days men shall seek death, and they shall not find it; and they shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 
And the likeness of (the) locusts be like horses made ready into battle; and on the heads of them as crowns like gold, and the faces of them as the faces of men. 
And they had hairs, as the hairs of women; and the teeth of them were as the teeth of lions. 
And they had habergeons, as iron habergeons, and the voice of their wings as the voice of (the) chariots of many horses running to battle. (And they had breastplates, like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and their horses rushing to battle.) 
And they had tails like scorpions, and pricks were in the tails of them; and the might of them was to annoy men (for) five months (or and their power was to be used to harm men for five months). 
And they had on them a king (or And they had a king over them), the angel of (the) deepness, to whom the name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but by Greek Apollyon, and by Latin he hath a name Exterminus, that is, Destroyer. 
One woe is passed, and lo! yet come two woes. 
After these things also the sixth angel trumped; and I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar (or and I heard a voice from the four corners of the gold altar), that is before the eyes of God, 
and said to the sixth angel that had a trump, Unbind thou the four angels, that be bound in the great flood Euphrates. (and it said to the sixth angel who had a trumpet, Unbind the four angels, who be bound at the great Euphrates River.) 
And the four angels were unbound, which were ready into (the) hour, and day, and month, and year, to slay the third part of men. 
And the number of the host of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand (or And the number of the army of the horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand). And I heard the number of them. 
And so I saw horses in vision; and they that sat on them had fiery habergeons, and of jacinth, and of brimstone, (or and those who sat upon them had fire-red breastplates, and hyacinth or blue ones, and yellow ones). And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and fire, and smoke, and brimstone, cometh forth (out) of the mouth(s) of them. 
Of these three plagues the third part of men was slain, of the fire, and of the smoke, and of the brimstone, that came out of the mouth(s) of them. (By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, that came out of their mouths.) 
For the power of the horses is in the mouth(s) of them, and in the tails of them; for the tails of them be like to serpents, having heads, and in them they annoy (or and with them they do much harm). 
And the other men, that were not slain in these plagues, neither did penance of the works of their hands, that they worshipped not devils, and simulacra of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of tree, which neither may see, neither hear, neither wander; (And the other men, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they did not worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which cannot see, nor hear, nor walk or go;) 
and they did not penance of their manslayings, neither of their witchcrafts, neither of their fornication, neither of their thefts, were slain. (and they did not repent of their murders, nor of their witchcrafts, nor of their fornication or their idolatry, nor of their thefts.)
