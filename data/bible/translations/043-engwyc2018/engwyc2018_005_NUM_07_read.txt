Chapter 7.
And it was done in the day in which Moses fulfilled, or ended, the tabernacle, and areared it, and anointed it, and hallowed it with all the vessels, or instruments, thereof, and the altar he hallowed in like manner, and the vessels thereof. (And it was done on the day in which Moses finished the Tabernacle, and raised it up, that he anointed it, and consecrated it, or dedicated it, and all of its vessels, or its instruments, and the altar, and its vessels.) 
And the princes of Israel, and the heads of families, that were, by all lineages, the sovereigns of them that were numbered, (And the leaders of Israel, that is, the heads of the families, who were, by all the tribes, the rulers of those who were listed, or were registered,) 
offered gifts before the Lord, six wains covered, with twelve oxen; two dukes offered one wain, and each offered one ox. And they offered those wains before the tabernacle. (brought their offerings before the Lord, in six covered wagons, with twelve oxen; two leaders, or two chief men, offered one wagon, and each offered one ox. And they brought those wagons to the front of the Tabernacle.) 
Soothly the Lord said to Moses, 
Take thou of them, that they serve in the service of the tabernacle, and betake thou those things to the deacons, by the order of their service. (Receive thou these gifts from them, to use in service for the Tabernacle, and give thou them to the Levites, according to the order of their service.) 
And so when Moses had taken the wains, and the oxen, he betook them to the deacons. (And so when Moses had received the wagons, and the oxen, he gave them to the Levites.) 
He gave two wains and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, after that (that) they had need (of). 
He gave four other wains and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, by their offices and religion (or for their duties and their service), under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron, the priest. 
Forsooth he gave not wains and oxen to the sons of Kohath, for they serve in the saintuary, and bear the charges with their own shoulders. (But he did not give any wagons or oxen to the sons of Kohath, for they serve in the sanctuary, and carry the loads with their own shoulders.) 
Therefore the dukes offered, in the hallowing of the altar, in the day in which it was anointed, their offering to the Lord, before the altar. (And so the leaders offered, for the dedication of the altar, on the day in which it was anointed, their offering to the Lord, before the altar.) 
And the Lord said to Moses, All the dukes by themselves offer they gifts, by all days by themselves, into the hallowing of the altar. (And the Lord said to Moses, Have all the leaders offer their gifts, one by one, in the days that follow, for the dedication of the altar.)
