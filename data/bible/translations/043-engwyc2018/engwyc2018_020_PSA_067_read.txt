PSALMS.
Chapter 67.
To victory in organs, the psalm of the song. God have mercy on us, and bless us; lighten he his cheer on us, and have he mercy on us. (For the choirmaster, with stringed instruments, a psalm, yea, a song. God have mercy on us, and bless us; make he his face to shine upon us, and have he mercy on us.) 
That we know thy way on earth; thine health in all folks. (So that we can know thy ways upon the earth; and thy salvation, or thy deliverance, among all the nations.) 
God, peoples acknowledge to thee; all peoples acknowledge to thee. (God, may the peoples praise thee; may all the peoples praise thee.) 
Heathen men be glad, and make fully joy, for thou deemest peoples in equity; and (ad)dressest heathen men in earth. (Let the heathen be glad, and make full out joy, or rejoice; for thou judgest the peoples with fairness, and directest, or guidest, the heathen upon the earth.) 
God, peoples acknowledge to thee, all peoples acknowledge to thee; (God, may the peoples praise thee, may all the peoples praise thee;) 
the earth hath given his fruit (or the earth hath given its fruits). God, our God, bless us, 
God bless us; and all the coasts of earth dread him. (God bless us; and may all the ends of the earth fear him or and may all the ends of the earth revere him.)
