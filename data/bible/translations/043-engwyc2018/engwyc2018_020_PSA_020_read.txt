Chapter 20.
To victory, the psalm of David. The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation; the name of God of Jacob defend thee. (For the choirmaster, a song by David. May the Lord answer thee in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob defend thee.) 
Send he help to thee from the holy place; and from Zion defend he thee. 
Be he mindful of all thy sacrifice; and thy burnt sacrifice be made fat. (May he remember all thy offerings; yea, may he be pleased with thy rich offerings or with thy burnt sacrifices.) 
Give he to thee after thine heart; and confirm he all thy counsel. (May he give he thee thy heart’s desire; yea, may he grant success to all thy plans.) 
We shall be glad in thine health; and we shall be magnified in the name of our God. The Lord ful fill all thine askings; (We shall be glad for thy victory or We shall be glad for thy salvation, or thy deliverance; and we shall magnify the name of our God. May the Lord grant all thy requests;) 
now I have known, that the Lord hath made safe his christ. He shall hear him from his holy heaven; the health of his right hand is in powers. (now I know that the Lord hath saved his anointed king. He shall answer him from his holy heaven; with the saving power of his right hand.) 
These, that is, adversaries, trust in chariots, and these in horses; but we shall inwardly call in the name of our Lord God. (Some, that is, our adversaries, trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we shall call on the name of the Lord our God.) 
They be bound, and felled down; but we have risen, and be raised. (They stumbled, and fell; but we have risen, and stand upright.) 
Lord, make thou safe the king; and hear thou us in the day in which we inwardly call thee. (Lord, save thou the king; yea, answer thou us on the day in which we call to thee.)
