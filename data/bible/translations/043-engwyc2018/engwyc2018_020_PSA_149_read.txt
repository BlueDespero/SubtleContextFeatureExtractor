Chapter 149.
Alleluia. Sing ye to the Lord a new song; his praising be in the church of saints. (Alleluia. Sing ye a new song to the Lord; let his praises be in the congregation of his saints.) 
Israel be glad in him that made him; and the daughters of Zion make full out joy in their king. (Let the people of Israel be glad in him, who made them; and let the daughters of Zion rejoice in their King.) 
Praise they his name in a quire; say they psalm to him in a tympan, and psaltery. (Praise they his name with a dance; sing they songs to him with a tympan, or with a drum, and a lute./Praise they his name with dancing; sing they songs to him with a tambourine, and a lute.) 
For the Lord is well pleased in his people; and he hath raised mild men into health. (For the Lord is well pleased with his people; and he hath raised up the meek to victory, or and he hath given salvation, or deliverance, to the humble.) 
Saints shall make full out joy in glory; they shall be glad in their beds. (The saints shall rejoice in triumph; they shall sing joyfully all night long.) 
The full out joyings of God in the throat of them; and swords sharp on both sides in the hands of them. (Let there be rejoicing for God on their lips or in their mouths; and let sharp swords be in their hands.) 
To do vengeance in nations; and blamings in peoples. (To bring vengeance to the nations; and to punish the peoples.) 
To bind the kings of them in stocks; and the noble men of them in iron manacles. (To bind up their kings in the stocks; and their noble men in iron manacles.) 
That they make in them (the) doom written; this is the glory to all his saints. (So that they execute the judgement written against them; this is the glory for all his saints.)
