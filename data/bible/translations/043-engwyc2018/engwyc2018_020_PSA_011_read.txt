Chapter 11.
To the victory, the psalmof David. I trust in the Lord; how say ye to my soul, Pass thou over into the hill, as a sparrow doeth? (For the choirmaster, a song by David. I trust in the Lord; how say ye to me, Fly thou over to the mountains, like a sparrow doeth?) 
For lo! sinners have bent a bow; they have made ready their arrows in an arrow case; that they shoot in darkness the rightful men in heart. (For behold! the sinners have bent their bows; and they have placed their arrows in their arrow cases; so that they can shoot in the dark those with an upright heart.) 
For they have destroyed, whom thou hast made perfect; but what did the rightful man? (For they shall destroy, what thou hast made good; but what can the upright do?) 
The Lord is in his holy temple; he is Lord, his seat is in heaven. His eyes behold on the poor man; his eyelids ask the sons of men. (The Lord is in his holy Temple; he is the Lord, his throne is in heaven. He looketh upon the poor; he assayeth the sons and daughters of men.) 
The Lord asketh a just man, and an unfaithful man; but he, that loveth wickedness, hateth his soul. (The Lord assayeth the righteous, and the unrighteous alike; and with all his soul, he hateth those who love wickedness.) 
He shall rain snares upon sinners; fire, and brimstone, and the spirit of tempests be the part of the cup of them. (He shall rain down snares upon the sinners; fire, and brimstone, and the winds of tempests shall be the portion in their cup.) 
For the Lord is just, and loveth rightfulnesses; his cheer hath seen evenness, or equity. (For the Lord is righteous, and loveth righteousness; he looketh upon the upright.)
