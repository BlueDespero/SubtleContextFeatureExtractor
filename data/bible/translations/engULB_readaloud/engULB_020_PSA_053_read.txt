Psalms.
Chapter 53.
For the chief musician; set to Mahalath. A maschil of David. A fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity; there is no one who does good. 
God looks down from heaven on the children of mankind to see if there are any who understand, who seek after him. 
They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt. There is not one who does good, not even one. 
Do those who commit iniquity have no understanding— those who devour my people as if they were eating bread and they do not call on God? 
They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there; for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you; such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them. 
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When God brings back his people from the captivity, then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!
