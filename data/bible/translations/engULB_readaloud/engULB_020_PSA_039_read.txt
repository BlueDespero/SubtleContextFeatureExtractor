Psalms.
Chapter 39.
For the chief musician, for Jeduthun. A psalm of David. I decided, “I will watch what I say so that I do not sin with my tongue. I will muzzle my mouth while in the presence of an evil man.” 
I kept silent; I kept back my words even from saying anything good, and my pain grew worse. 
My heart became hot; when I thought about these things, it burned like a fire. Then finally I spoke. 
“Yahweh, make me know when will be the end of my life and the extent of my days. Show me how transient I am. 
See, you have made my days only the width of my hand, and my lifetime is like nothing before you. Surely every man is a single breath. Selah 
Surely every man walks about like a shadow. Surely everyone hurries about to accumulate riches although they do not know who will receive them. 
Now, Lord, for what am I waiting? You are my only hope. 
Rescue me from my sins; do not make me the reproach of fools. 
I am silent and cannot open my mouth, because it is you who has done it. 
Stop wounding me; I am overwhelmed by the blow of your hand. 
When you discipline people for sin, you consume the things they desire like a moth; surely all people are nothing but vapor. Selah 
Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and listen to me; listen to my weeping! Do not be deaf to me, for I am like a foreigner with you, a refugee like all my ancestors were. 
Turn your gaze from me so that I may smile again before I die.”
