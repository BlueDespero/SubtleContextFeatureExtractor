Psalms.
Chapter 13.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David. How long, Yahweh, will you keep forgetting about me? How long will you hide your face from me? 
How long must I worry and have grief in my heart all day? How long will my enemy triumph over me? 
Look at me and answer me, Yahweh my God! Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death. 
Do not let my enemy say, “I have defeated him,” so that my enemy may not say, “I have prevailed over my adversary”; otherwise, my enemies will rejoice when I am brought down. 
But I have trusted in your covenant faithfulness; my heart rejoices in your salvation. 
I will sing to Yahweh because he has treated me very generously.
