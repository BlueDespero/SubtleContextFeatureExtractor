Hosea.
Chapter 6.
“Come, let us return to Yahweh. For he has torn us to pieces, but he will heal us; he has injured us, but he will bandage our wounds. 
After two days he will revive us; he will raise us up on the third day, and we will live before him. 
Let us know Yahweh; let us press on to know Yahweh. His coming out is as sure as the dawn; he will come to us like the showers, like the spring rains that water the land.” 
Ephraim, what will I do with you? Judah, what will I do with you? Your faithfulness is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes away early. 
So I have cut them to pieces by the prophets, I have killed them with the words of my mouth. Your decrees are like the light that shines out. 
For I desire faithfulness and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 
Like Adam they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me. 
Gilead is a city of evildoers with footprints of blood. 
As gangs of robbers wait for someone, so the priests band together to commit murder on the way to Shechem; they have committed shameful crimes. 
In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's prostitution is there, and Israel has become unclean. 
For you also, Judah, a harvest has been appointed, when I will restore the fortunes of my people.
