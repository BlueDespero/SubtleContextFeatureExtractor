Psalms.
Chapter 124.
A song of ascents; of David. “If Yahweh had not been on our side,” let Israel say now, 
“if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side when men rose up against us, 
then they would have swallowed us up alive when their anger raged against us. 
The water would have swept us away; the torrent would have overwhelmed us. 
Then the raging waters would have drowned us.” 
Blessed be Yahweh, who has not allowed us to be torn by their teeth. 
We have escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. 
Our help is in Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
