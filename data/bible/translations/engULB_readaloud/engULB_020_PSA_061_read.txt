Psalms.
Chapter 61.
For the chief musician; on a stringed instrument. A psalm of David. Hear my cry, God; attend to my prayer. 
From the ends of the earth will I call to you when my heart is faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy. 
Let me live in your tabernacle forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings. Selah 
For you, God, have heard my vows, you have given me the inheritance of those who honor your name. 
You will prolong the king's life; his years will be like many generations. 
He will remain before God forever. 
I will sing praise to your name forever so that I may perform my vows every day.
