Psalms.
Chapter 98.
A psalm. Oh, sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have given him victory. 
Yahweh has made known his salvation; he has openly showed his justice to all the nations. 
He calls to mind his covenant loyalty and faithfulness for the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth will see the victory of our God. 
Shout for joy to Yahweh, all the earth; burst into song, sing for joy, and sing praises. 
Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and melodious song. 
With trumpets and the sound of the horn, make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh. 
Let the sea shout and everything in it, the world and those who live in it! 
Let the rivers clap their hands, and let the mountains shout for joy. 
Yahweh is coming to judge the earth; he will judge the world with righteousness and the nations with fairness.
