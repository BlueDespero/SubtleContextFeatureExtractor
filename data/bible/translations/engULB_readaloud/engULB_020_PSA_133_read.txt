Psalms.
Chapter 133.
A song of ascents, of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together! 
It is like fine oil on the head pouring down on the beard— Aaron's beard, and then it pours down on the collar of his robes. 
It is like the dew of Hermon which falls on the mountains of Zion. For there Yahweh commanded the blessing— life forevermore.
