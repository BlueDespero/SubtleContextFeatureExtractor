Psalms.
Chapter 114.
When Israel left Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people who spoke a foreign language, 
Judah became his holy place, Israel his kingdom. 
The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back. 
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills skipped like lambs. 
Why did you flee, sea? Jordan, why did you turn back? 
Mountains, why did you skip like rams? You little hills, why did you skip like lambs? 
Tremble, earth, before the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob. 
He turned the rock into a pool of water, the hard rock into a spring of water.
