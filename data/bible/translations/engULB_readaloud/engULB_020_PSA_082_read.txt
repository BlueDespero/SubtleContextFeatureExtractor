Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A psalm of Asaph. God stands in the divine assembly; in the midst of the gods he renders judgment. 
How long will you judge unjustly and show favoritism to the wicked? Selah 
Defend the poor and fatherless; maintain the rights of the afflicted and destitute. 
Rescue the poor and needy; take them out of the hand of the wicked. 
They neither know nor understand; they wander around in the darkness; all the foundations of the earth crumble. 
I said, “You are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High. 
Nevertheless you will die like men and fall like one of the princes.” 
Arise, God, judge the earth, for you have an inheritance in all the nations.
