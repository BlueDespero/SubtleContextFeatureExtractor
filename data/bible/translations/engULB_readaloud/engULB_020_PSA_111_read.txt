Psalms.
Chapter 111.
Praise Yahweh. I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright, in their gathering. 
The works of Yahweh are great, eagerly awaited by all those who desire them. 
His work is majestic and glorious, and his righteousness endures forever. 
He does wonderful things that will be remembered; Yahweh is gracious and merciful. 
He gives food to his faithful followers. He will always call to mind his covenant. 
He showed his powerful works to his people in giving them the inheritance of the nations. 
The works of his hands are trustworthy and just; all his instructions are reliable. 
They are established forever, to be observed faithfully and properly. 
He gave victory to his people; he ordained his covenant forever; holy and awesome is his name. 
To honor Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; those who carry out his instructions have good understanding. His praise endures forever.
