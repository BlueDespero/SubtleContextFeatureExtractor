Psalms.
Chapter 101.
A psalm of David. I will sing of covenant faithfulness and justice; to you, Yahweh, I will sing praises. 
I will walk in the way of integrity. Oh, when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity within my house. 
I will not put wrongdoing before my eyes; I hate worthless evil; it will not cling to me. 
Perverse people will leave me; I am not loyal to evil. 
I will destroy whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. I will not tolerate anyone who has a proud demeanor and an arrogant attitude. 
I will look to the faithful of the land to sit at my side. Those who walk in the way of integrity may serve me. 
Deceitful people will not remain within my house; liars will not be welcome before my eyes. 
Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked from the land; I will remove all evildoers from the city of Yahweh.
