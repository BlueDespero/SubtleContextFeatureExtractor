Job.
Chapter 23.
Then Job answered and said, 
“Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy because of my groaning. 
Oh, that I knew where I might find him! Oh, that I might come to his place! 
I would lay my case in order before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 
I would learn the words with which he would answer me and would understand what he would say to me. 
Would he argue against me in the greatness of his power? No, he would pay attention to me. 
There the upright person might argue with him. In this way I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 
See, I go eastward, but he is not there, and westward, but I cannot perceive him. 
To the north, where he is at work, but I cannot see him, and to the south, where he hides himself so that I cannot see him. 
But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come out like gold. 
My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept to his way and turned not aside. 
I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food. 
But he is one of a kind, who can turn him back? What he desires, he does. 
For he carries out his decree against me; there are many like them. 
Therefore, I am terrified in his presence; when I think about him, I am afraid of him. 
For God has made my heart weak; the Almighty has terrified me. 
I have not been brought to an end by darkness, because of the thick darkness that covers the gloom of my face.
