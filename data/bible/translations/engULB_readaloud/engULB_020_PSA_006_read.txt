Psalms.
Chapter 6.
For the chief musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith style. A psalm of David. Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath. 
Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am frail; heal me, Yahweh, for my bones are shaking. 
My soul also is very troubled. But you, Yahweh—how long will this continue? 
Return, Yahweh! rescue me. Save me because of your covenant faithfulness! 
For in death there is no remembrance of you. In Sheol who will give you thanks? 
I am weary with my groaning. All night I drench my bed with tears; I wash my couch away with my tears. 
My eyes grow dim from grief; they grow weak because of all my adversaries. 
Get away from me, all you who practice iniquity; for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping. 
Yahweh has heard my appeal for mercy; Yahweh has accepted my prayer. 
All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly troubled. They will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.
