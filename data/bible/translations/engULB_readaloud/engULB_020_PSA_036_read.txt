Psalms.
Chapter 36.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David the servant of Yahweh. An evil man speaks of his transgression from deep in his heart, there is no fear of God in his eyes. 
For he comforts himself, thinking that his sin will not be discovered and be hated. 
His words are sinful and deceitful; he does not want to be wise and do good. 
While he lies in bed, he plans ways to sin; he sets out on an evil way; he does not reject evil. 
Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, reaches to the heavens; your loyalty reaches to the clouds. 
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep. Yahweh, you preserve both mankind and the animals. 
How precious is your covenant faithfulness, God! Humanity takes refuge under the shadow of your wings. 
They feast upon the abundance of your house; you let them drink from the river of your delights. 
For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we will see light. 
Extend your covenant faithfulness fully to those who know you, your defense to the upright of heart. 
Do not let the foot of the arrogant man come near to me. Do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
Over there the evildoers have fallen; they are knocked down and are not able to get up.
