Psalms.
Chapter 110.
A psalm of David. Yahweh says to my master, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.” 
Yahweh will hold out the scepter of your strength from Zion; rule among your enemies. 
Your people will follow you in holy garments of their own free will on the day of your power; from the womb of the dawn your youth will be to you like the dew. 
Yahweh has sworn, and will not change: “You are a priest forever, after the manner of Melchizedek.” 
The Lord is at your right hand. He will kill kings on the day of his anger. 
He will judge the nations; he will fill the battlegrounds with dead bodies; he will kill the leaders in many countries. 
He will drink of the brook along the road, and then he will lift his head up high after victory.
