PSALMS.
Chapter 39.
I said to myself, “I will be careful not to sin by the things that I say MTY. I will not say anything to complain while wicked people are near to me and can hear me.” 
So I was completely silent DOU, and I did not even talk about things that were good, but it was useless, because I began to suffer even more. 
I became very anxious/worried IDM. As I thought about my troubles, I became more worried. Then finally I said MTY, 
“Yahweh, show/tell me how long I will live. Tell me when I will die. Tell me how many years I will live! 
It seems that you have caused me to live only a short time; ◄my lifetime/all the time that I have lived► seems like nothing to you. The time that all we humans live is as short as MET a puff of wind. 
Then we disappear like a shadow does. It seems that all that we do is for nothing/useless. We sometimes get a lot of money, but we do not know who will get it after we die. 
So now, Yahweh, if I expect RHQ to receive blessings from other people, I will be disappointed. You are the only one from whom I confidently expect to receive blessings. 
Save me from being punished for all the sins that I have committed. And do not allow foolish people to make fun of me. 
I did not say anything when you punished me, because I knew that you were the one who caused me to suffer. 
But now, please stop punishing me! If you do not do that, I am about to die because of the ways that you SYN have struck/afflicted me. 
When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed, you destroy the things that ◄he loves/are precious to him►, like moths’ larva destroy clothing. Our lives disappear like a puff of wind. 
Yahweh, listen to me while I pray; pay attention to me while I cry out to you. Help me while I am crying. I am here on the earth for only a short time, like all my ancestors. 
Now please leave me alone, and do not punish me anymore in order that I may smile and be happy for a while before I die. EUP, DOU”
