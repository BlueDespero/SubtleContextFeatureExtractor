Chapter 54.
God, by your power MTY, DOU save me from my enemies, and show people that I have not done anything that is wrong! 
God, listen to my prayer; listen to what I say to you, 
because strangers are trying to attack me; proud men are wanting to kill me; men who do not have any ◄respect for/interest in► you. 
But God is the one who helps me; Yahweh defends/protects me from my enemies. 
He will cause the evil things that they want to do to me to happen to them instead; because he faithfully does what he promises, he will get rid of them. 
Yahweh, I will gladly give an offering to you because I want to, and I will thank you MTY, for you are good to me; 
you have rescued me from all my troubles, and I have seen that you have defeated my enemies.
