Chapter 3.
Yahweh, I have many enemies DOU! There are many people who oppose/rebel against me. 
Many people are saying about me, “God will certainly not help him!” 
But Yahweh, you are like a shield that protects me MET. You greatly honor me, and you encourage me (OR, enable me to triumph over my enemies) IDM. 
I cry out to you, Yahweh, and you answer me from Zion, your sacred hill. 
At night I lie down and sleep, and I awake in the morning feeling good/refreshed because you, Yahweh, ◄take care of/protect► me all during the night. 
There may be thousands of enemy soldiers who surround me, but I am not afraid. 
Yahweh, arise! My God, come and rescue me again! You insult my enemies by slapping them on their cheeks; when you strike them, you break their teeth, with the result that they cannot hurt anyone MET. 
Yahweh, you are the one who saves your people from their enemies. Yahweh, bless your people!
