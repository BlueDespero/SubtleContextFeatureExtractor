Chapter 150.
Praise Yahweh! Praise God in his sacred temple! And praise him in his fortress in heaven! 
Praise him for the mighty deeds that he has performed; praise him for his being extremely great! 
Praise him by blowing trumpets loudly; praise him by playing harps and ◄small lyres/other instruments that have many strings►! 
Praise him by beating drums and by dancing. Praise him by playing stringed instruments and by playing flutes! 
Praise him by clashing cymbals together; praise him by clashing together very loud cymbals! 
I want all living creatures to praise Yahweh! Praise Yahweh!
