Chapter 100.
Everyone in the world should shout joyfully to Yahweh! 
We should worship Yahweh gladly! We should come before him singing joyful songs. 
We should acknowledge/recognize that Yahweh is God; it is he who made us, so we belong to him. We are the people that he takes care of MET; we are like sheep that are cared for by their shepherd. 
Enter the gates of his temple thanking him; enter the courtyard of the temple singing songs to praise him! Thank him and praise him, 
because Yahweh always does good things for us. He faithfully loves us, and ◄is faithful/is loyal to us forever/will never forsake us►.
