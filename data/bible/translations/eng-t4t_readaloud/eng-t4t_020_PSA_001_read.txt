Psalms.
Chapter 1.
God is pleased with those who do not do what MET wicked people advise them to do, and who do not imitate the behavior of MET sinful people, and who do not join in with people who ◄ridicule/sneer at► God. 
Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that he has instructed/taught us to do. They read and think about Yahweh’s requirements, day and night. 
They constantly produce/do things that please God just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year. Like trees that never wither, they succeed in everything that they do. 
But wicked people are not like that! Wicked people are as worthless as chaff that is blown away by the wind. 
Therefore, wicked people ◄will not be acquitted/will be condemned► LIT when God judges people, and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when God gathers righteous people together, 
because he guides and protects righteous people, but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed/punished by God forever.
