Chapter 124.
You Israeli people, answer this question: What would have happened to us if Yahweh had not been ◄helping/fighting for► us? 
When our enemies attacked us, if Yahweh had not been fighting for us, 
we would have all been killed IDM because they were very angry with us! 
They would have been like MET a flood that swept/carried us away; it would have been as though the water would have covered us, 
and we would all have drowned in the flood that was ◄raging/flowing very fast►. 
But praise Yahweh, because he has not allowed our enemies to destroy us like wild animals MET tear apart the creatures that they capture. 
We have escaped from our enemies like a bird escapes from the trap that hunters have set; it is as though the trap that our enemies set for us was broken and we have escaped from it! 
Yahweh is the one who helps us MTY; he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
