Chapter 85.
Yahweh, you have been kind to us people who live in this land; you have enabled us Israeli people to become prosperous again. 
You forgave us, your people, for the sins that we had committed; you pardoned us for all our sins DOU. 
You stopped being angry with us and turned away from severely punishing us. 
Now, God, the one who saves/rescues us, ◄restore us/make us prosperous again► and stop being angry with us! 
◄Will you continue to be angry with us forever?/Please do not continue to be angry with us forever.► DOU, RHQ 
Please enable us RHQ to prosper again in order that we, your people, will rejoice about what you have done for us. 
Yahweh, by rescuing us from our troubles/difficulties, show us that you faithfully love us. 
I want to listen to what Yahweh our God says, because he promises/says that he will enable us, his people, to live peacefully, if we do not return to doing foolish things. 
He is surely ready to save/rescue those who revere him, in order that his glory/splendor will be seen in our land. 
When that happens, he will both faithfully love us and faithfully do for us what he promised to do PRS; and we will act/behave righteously, and he will give us peace, which will be like a kiss that he gives us. 
Here on earth, we will ◄be loyal to/continually believe in► God, and from heaven, God will act justly/fairly toward us. 
Yes, Yahweh will do good things for us, and there will be great harvests in our land. 
Yahweh always acts righteously PRS, MET; he acts righteously wherever he goes.
