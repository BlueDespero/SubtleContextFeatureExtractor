Chapter 26.
Yahweh, show that I ◄am innocent/have not done what is wrong►. I always do what is right; I have trusted in you and never doubted that you would help me. 
Yahweh, examine what I have done and test me; thoroughly evaluate what I think IDM. 
I never forget that you faithfully love me, I conduct my life according to your truth. 
I do not spend my time with liars and I stay away from hypocrites. 
I do not like to be with evil people, and I avoid wicked people. 
Yahweh, I wash my hands to show that I ◄am innocent/have not done what was wrong►. As I join with others marching around your altar, 
we sing songs to thank you, and we tell others the wonderful things that you have done. 
Yahweh, I love to be in the temple where you live, in the place where your glory appears. 
Do not get rid of me like you get rid of sinners; do not cause me to die like you cause those who murder MTY people to die, 
and people who SYN are ready to do wicked things and people who are always taking bribes. 
But as for me, I always try to do what is right. So be kind to me and rescue me. 
I stand in places where I am safe, and when all your people gather together, I praise you.
