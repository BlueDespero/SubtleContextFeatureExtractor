You will remove their children from this earth; their descendants will all disappear. 
They planned to harm you, but what they plan will never succeed. 
You will cause them to run away IDM by shooting arrows at them. 
Yahweh, show us that you are very strong! When you do that, while we sing we will praise you because you are very powerful.
