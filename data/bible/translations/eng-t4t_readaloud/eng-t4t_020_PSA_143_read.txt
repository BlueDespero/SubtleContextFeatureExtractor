Chapter 143.
Yahweh, hear me while I pray to you! Because you are righteous and because you faithfully do what you have promised, listen to what I am pleading that you do for me. 
I am one who serves you; do not judge me, because you know that everyone has done things that are wrong►. 
My enemies have pursued me; they have completely defeated me. It is as though they have put me in a dark prison, where I have nothing good to ◄hope for/expect►, like those who died long ago SIM. 
So I am very discouraged; I am very dismayed/worried. 
I remember what has happened previously: I ◄meditate on/think about► all the things that you have done; I consider all the great deeds that you SYN have performed. 
I lift up my hands/arms to you while I pray; I SYN need you, like very dry ground needs rain SIM. 
Yahweh, I am very discouraged, so please answer me right now! Do not hide from me, because if you do that, I will soon be SIM among those who descend to where the dead people are. 
Every morning cause me to remember that you faithfully love me, because I trust in you. I ◄pray/send my prayers up IDM► to you; show me what I should do. 
Yahweh, I have gone/run to you to be protected, so rescue me from my enemies. 
You are my God; teach me to do what you want me to do. I want your good Spirit to lead me on a path that is not difficult to walk on. 
Yahweh, restore me when I am close to dying, as you promised to do. Because you are righteous/good, rescue me from my troubles/difficulties! 
I am one who serves you; so because you faithfully love me, kill my enemies and get rid of all those who ◄oppress/cause trouble for► me.
