NUMBERS.
Chapter 30.
Moses/I spoke with the leaders of the Israeli tribes. He/I told them these commands that Yahweh had given to him/me: 
“If a man solemnly promises Yahweh that he will do something, he must do what he promised. 
“f a young woman who is still living with her parents solemnly promises to Yahweh to do something, 
and if her father hears about what she promised, and if he does not object, she must do what she promised DOU. 
But if her father hears about what she promised and does not allow her to do that, then she does not need to do what she promised. Yahweh will forgive her for not doing what she promised. 
“f a woman promises Yahweh that she will do something, but then she gets married, 
if her husband hears about what she promised to do, and he does not object, she must do what she promised DOU. 
But if her husband hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not need to do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing what she promised. 
“f a widow or a woman who has been divorced makes a promise, she must do what she promised. 
“f a woman who is married promises DOU to do something, 
and if her husband hears about it but does not object, she must do what she promised. 
But if he hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not need to do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing it. 
A woman’s husband may require her to do what she has promised, or he may not allow her to do what she has promised. 
If he does not object for several days after he hears about it, she must do what she promised. 
But if he waits a long time after she has promised to do something and then he tells her that he will not permit her to do it, if she does not do what she promised, she will not be punished; her husband is the one whom Yahweh will punish.” 
Those are the rules that Yahweh gave to Moses/me for husbands and wives, and for young women who are still living with their parents.
