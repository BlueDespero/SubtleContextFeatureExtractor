Chapter 116.
I love Yahweh, because he hears me when I cry for him to help me. 
He listens to me, so I will call out to him all during my life. 
Everything around me MET caused me to think that I would die; I was very afraid that I would die and go to the place where dead people are. I was very distressed/worried and afraid. 
But then I called out to Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh, I plead with you to save/rescue me!” 
Yahweh is kind and does what is right; he is our God, and he acts mercifully to us. 
He protects those who ◄are helpless/cannot defend themselves►; and when I thought that I would die, he saved me. 
I must encourage/tell myself to ◄have inner peace/not worry anymore►, because Yahweh has done very good things for me. 
Yahweh has saved me SYN from dying, and has kept/protected me from troubles that would cause me to cry. He has kept/protected me from stumbling. 
So here on the earth, where people are still alive, I live knowing that Yahweh is directing me. 
I continued to believe/trust in Yahweh, even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted/troubled.” 
Even when I was distressed/worried and said, “I cannot trust anyone,” I continued to trust in Yahweh. 
So now I will tell you RHQ what I will offer to Yahweh, because of all the good things that he has done for me. 
I will offer to him a cup of wine to thank him for saving/rescuing me. 
When I am together with many HYP people who belong to Yahweh, I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him. 
Yahweh is very grieved/sad when one of his people dies. 
I am one of those who serve Yahweh; I serve him like my mother did. He has freed/saved me from dying (OR, from being fastened by chains). 
So I will offer to him a sacrifice to thank him, and I will pray to him. 
When I am together with many of HYP the people who belong to Yahweh, in the courtyard outside his temple in Jerusalem, I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him. Praise Yahweh!
