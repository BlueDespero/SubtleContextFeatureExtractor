JOB.
Chapter 18.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, and said, 
Unto what end shalt thou boast with words? Understand thou us first, and so speak we together. 
Why be we areckoned as beasts, and why have we been foul before thee? 
What or why losest thou thy soul in thy strong vengeance? Whether the earth shall be forsaken for thee, and hard stones shall be borne over from their place? 
Whether the light of a wicked man shall not be quenched; and the flame of his fire shall not shine? 
Light shall wax dark in his tabernacle; and the lantern, which is on him, shall be quenched. 
The steps of his strength shall be made strait; and his counsel shall cast him down. 
For he hath sent, or put, his feet into a net; and he goeth in the meshes, or knittings, thereof. 
His foot shall be holden with a snare; and thirst shall burn out against him. 
The foot-trap of him is hid in the earth, and his snare is laid on the path. 
Dreads shall make him afeared on every side, and shall bewrap his feet. 
His strength shall be made feeble by hunger; and poverty assail his ribs. 
Devour it the fairness of his skin; the first engendered of death waste his arms. 
His trust be taken away from his tabernacle; and perishing, as a king, above-tread on him. 
The fellows of him that is not, that is, the fellows of a dead man, dwell in his tabernacle; and brimstone be sprinkled in his tabernacle. 
The roots of him be made dry beneath; and be his ripe corn all-broken above. 
His mind perish from the earth; and his name be not made solemn in streets. 
He shall put him out from light into darknesses; and he shall bear him over from the world. 
Neither his seed, neither his kin-dred, shall be in his people, neither any remnants of them left in his countries. 
The last men shall wonder in his days; and hideousness shall assail the first men. 
Therefore these be the tabernacles of a wicked man; and this is the place of him, that knoweth not God.
