Chapter 12.
To the victory, on the eighth, the song of David. Lord, make thou me safe, for the holy man failed; for truths be made little from the sons of men. 
They spake vain things, each man to his neighbour; and they having guileful lips, spake in their heart, and with their heart. 
The Lord destroy all guileful lips; and the great speaking tongue. 
Which said, We shall magnify with our tongue, our lips be of us-selves; who else is our lord? 
For the wretchedness of needy men, and for the wailing of poor men; now I shall rise up, saith the Lord. I shall set him in health; I shall do trustily in him. 
The speeches of the Lord be chaste speeches; silver assayed by fire, proved from the earth, purged sevenfold. 
Thou, Lord, shalt keep us; and thou shalt keep us from this gener-ation without end. 
Wicked men go in compass; by thine highness thou hast multiplied the sons of men.
