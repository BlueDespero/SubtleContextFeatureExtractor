SONG OF SONGS.
Chapter 2.
I am a flower of the field, and a lily of great valleys. 
As a lily among thorns, so is my friendess among daughters. 
As an apple tree among the trees of woods, so is my darling among sons. I sat under the shadow of him, whom I desired; and his fruit was sweet to my throat. 
The king led me into the wine cellar; he ordained charity in me. 
Beset ye me with flowers, en-compass ye me with apples; for I am sick for love. 
His left hand is under mine head; and his right hand shall embrace me. 
Ye daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you greatly, by caprets, and harts of fields, that ye raise not, neither make to awake the dear-worthy spousess, till she will. 
The voice of my darling; lo! this darling cometh leaping in mountains, and skipping over little hills. 
My darling is like a capret, and a calf of harts; lo! he standeth behind our wall, and beholdeth by the windows, and looketh through the lattice. 
Lo! my darling speaketh to me, My love, my culver, my fair spousess, rise thou, haste thou, and come thou; 
for winter is passed now, rain is gone, and is departed away. 
Flowers have appeared in our land, and the time of cutting is come; the voice of a turtle is heard in our land, 
the fig tree hath brought forth his buds; the vineries flowering have given their odour. My love, my fair spousess, rise thou, haste thou, and come thou. 
My culver is in the holes of the stone, in the chink of a wall without mortar. Show thy face to me, thy voice sound in mine ears; for thy voice is sweet, and thy face is fair. 
Catch ye little foxes to us, that destroy the vineries; for our vinery hath flowered. 
My darling is to me, and I am to him, which is fed among lilies; 
till the day spring, and shadows be bowed down. My darling, turn thou again; be thou like a capret, and a calf of harts, on the hills of Bether.
