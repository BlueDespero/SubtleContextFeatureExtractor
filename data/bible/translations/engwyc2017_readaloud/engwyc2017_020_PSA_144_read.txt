Chapter 144.
A psalm of David. Blessed be my Lord God, that teacheth mine hands to war; and my fingers to battle. 
My mercy, and my refuge; my taker-up, and my deliverer. My defender, and I hoped in him; and thou makest subject my people under me. 
Lord, what is a man, for thou hast made thyself known to him; either the son of man, for thou areckonest him of some value? 
A man is made like vanity; his days pass as a shadow. 
Lord, bow down thine heavens, and come thou down; touch thou the hills, and they shall make smoke. 
Light thou shining, and thou shalt scatter them; send thou out thine arrows, and thou shalt trouble them. 
Send out thine hand from on high, ravish me out, and deliver thou me from many waters; and from the hand of alien sons. 
The mouth of whom spake vanity; and the right hand of them is the right hand of wickedness. 
God, I shall sing to thee a new song; I shall say psalm to thee in psaltery of ten strings. 
Which givest health to kings, which again-boughtest David, thy servant; from the wicked sword ravish thou out me. 
And deliver thou me from the hand of alien sons; the mouth of which spake vanity, and the right hand of them is the right hand of wickedness. 
Whose sons be as new plantings in their youth. The daughters of them be arrayed; adorned about as the likeness of a temple. 
The cellars of them be full; bring-ing out from this vessel into that, or from one vessel into another. The sheep of them be with lambs, plenteous or abounding in their goings out; 
their kine be fat. There is no falling of their wall, neither passing over of it; neither cry is in the streets of them. 
They said, The people is blessed, that hath these things; blessed is the people, whose Lord is the God of it.
