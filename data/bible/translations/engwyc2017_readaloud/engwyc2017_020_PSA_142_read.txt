Chapter 142.
The learning of David; his prayer, when he was in the den. With my voice I cried to the Lord; with my voice I prayed heartily to the Lord. 
I shedded or poured out my prayer in his sight; and I pronounced my tribulation before him. 
While my spirit faileth of me; and thou hast known my paths. In this way in which I went; proud men hid a snare to me. 
I beheld to the right side, and I saw; and none there was that knew me. Flight perished from me; and none there is that seeketh to help my soul. 
Lord, I cried to thee; I said, Thou art mine hope; my part in the land of livers. 
Give thou attention to my beseech-ing; for I am made low full greatly. Deliver thou me from them that pur-sue me; for they be comforted on or over me. 
Lead my soul out of keeping to acknowledge to thy name; just or rightwise men abide me, till thou yield to me.
