PROVERBS.
Chapter 9.
Wisdom builded an house to himself; he hewed out seven pillars, 
he offered his slain sacrifices, he meddled or mingled wine, and setted or set forth his table. 
He sent his handmaids, that they should call to the tower; and to the walls of the city. 
If any man is little in wit, come he to me. And wisdom spake to unwise men, 
Come ye, eat ye my bread; and drink ye the wine, which I have meddled or mingled to you. 
Forsake ye young childhood, and live ye; and go ye by the way of prudence. 
He that teacheth a scorner, doeth wrong to himself; and he that reproveth a wicked man, engendereth a wem to himself. 
Do not thou reprove a scorner; lest he hate thee. Reprove thou a wise man; and he shall love thee. 
Give thou occasion to a wise man; and wisdom shall be increased to him. Teach thou a just or rightwise man; and he shall hasten to take it. 
The beginning of wisdom is the dread of the Lord; and prudence is the knowing of saints. 
For thy days shall be multiplied by me; and the years of life shall be increased to thee. 
If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise to thyself, and to thy neighbours. Forsooth if thou art a scorner, thou alone shalt bear evil. 
A fond or foolish woman, and full of cry, and full of unleaveful lusts, and that knoweth nothing utterly, 
sitteth in the doors of her house, on a seat, in an high place of the city; 
to call men passing by the way, and men going in their journey. 
Who is a little man in wit; bow he to me. And she spake to a coward or to the sorry-hearted, 
Waters of theft be sweeter, and bread hid is sweeter. Stolen waters be sweeter, and hid bread more sweet. 
And he knew not that giants be there; and the guests of her be in the depths of hell. Soothly he that shall be applied, either fastened, to her, shall go down to hells or shall fall down into hell. For why he that goeth away from her shall be saved.
