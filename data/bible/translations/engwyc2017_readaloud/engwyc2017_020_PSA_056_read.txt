Chapter 56.
To the overcoming, on the dumb culver of far drawing away, the comely song of David, when the Philistines held him in Gath. God, have mercy on me, for a man hath defouled me; all day he impugned, and troubled me. 
Mine enemies defouled me all day; for many fighters were against me. 
Of the highness of day I shall dread; but God, I shall hope in thee. 
In God I shall praise my words; I hoped in God, I shall not dread what thing flesh, or man, shall do to me. 
All day they cursed my words; against me all their thoughts were into evil. 
They shall dwell, and they shall hide; they shall ambush mine heel. As they abide my life, 
for nought shalt thou make them safe; in ire thou shalt break altogether peoples. 
God, I showed my life to thee; thou hast set or puttest my tears in thy sight. As and in thy promise, Lord; 
then mine enemies shall be turned aback. In whatever day I shall inwardly call thee; lo! I have known, that thou art my God. 
In God I shall praise a word; in the Lord I shall praise a word. 
I shall hope in God; I shall not dread what thing man shall do to me. 
God, thine avows or vows be in me; which I shall yield praisings to thee. 
For thou hast delivered my life from death, and my feet from sliding; that I please before God in the light of them that live.
