Chapter 100.
A psalm to acknowledge. All earth, sing ye heartily to God; 
serve ye the Lord in gladness. Enter ye in his sight in full out joying. 
Know ye, that the Lord himself is God; he made us, and not we made us. His people, and the sheep of his pasture, 
enter ye into his gates in acknowl-edging; enter ye into his porches, acknowledge ye to him in hymns. Praise ye his name, 
for the Lord is sweet, his mercy is without end; and his truth is in generation and into generation.
