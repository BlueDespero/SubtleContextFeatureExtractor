2ND CORINTHIANS.
Chapter 9.
For of the ministry that is made to holy men, it is to me of plenty to write to you. 
For I know your ready will, for the which I have glory of you with Macedonians, for also Achaia is ready from a year passed, and your love hath stirred full many. 
And we have sent brethren, that this thing that we glory of you, be not voided in this part, that as I said, ye be ready. 
Lest when Macedonians come with me, and find you unready, we be shamed, that we say you not or that we saw you not, in this substance. 
Therefore I guessed necessary to pray brethren, that they come before to you, and make ready this promised blessing to be ready, so as blessing, and not as avarice. 
For I say this thing, he that soweth scarcely, shall also reap scarcely; and he that soweth in blessings, shall reap also of blessings. 
Each man as he casted in his heart, not of heaviness, or of need; for God loveth a glad giver. 
And God is mighty to make all grace abound in you, that ye in all things evermore have all sufficience, and abound into all good work; 
as it is written, He dealed abroad, he gave to poor men, his rightwise-ness dwelleth without end. 
And he that ministereth seed to the sower, shall give also bread to eat, and he shall multiply your seed, and make much the increasings of fruits of your rightwiseness; 
that in all things ye made rich wax plenteous or abound into all simpleness, which worketh by us doing of thankings to God. 
For the ministry of this office not only filleth those things that fail to holy men, but also multiplieth many thankings to God, 
by the proving of this ministry, which glorify God in the obedience of your acknowledging in the gospel of Christ, and in simpleness of communication into them and into all others, 
and in the beseeching of them for you, that desire you for the excellent grace of God in you. 
I do thankings to God of the gift of him, that may not be told.
