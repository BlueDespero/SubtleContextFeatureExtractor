ZECHARIAH.
Chapter 4.
And the angel turned again, that spake in me, and raised me, as a man that is raised up out of his sleep. 
And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I saw, and lo! a candlestick all of gold, and the lamp thereof on the head thereof, and seven lanterns thereof on it, and seven vessels for to hold oil to the lanterns, that were on the head thereof. 
And two olives thereon, one of the right half of the lamp, and another on the left half thereof. 
And I answered, and said to the angel that spake in me, and I said, What be these things, my lord? 
And the angel that spake in me, answered, and said to me, Whether thou knowest not what be these things? And I said, No, my lord. 
And he answered, and said to me, and spake, This is the word of the Lord, saying to Zerubbabel, Not in host, neither in strength, but in my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. 
Who art thou, great hill, before Zerubbabel, into plain? and he shall lead out the first stone, and shall make even grace to grace thereof. 
And the word of the Lord was made to me, and said, 
The hands of Zerubbabel founded this house, and the hands of him shall perform it; and ye shall know, that the Lord of hosts sent me to you. 
Who forsooth despised little days? and they shall be glad, and shall see a stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel. These be the seven eyes of the Lord, that run about into all earth. 
And I answered, and said to him, What be these twain or two olives on the right half of the candlestick, and at the left half thereof? 
And I answered the second time, and said to him, What be the twain or two ears, either ripe fruit, of olives that be beside the two pipes of gold, in which be oil vessels of gold? 
And he said to me, and spake, Whether thou knowest not what be these things? And I said, No, my lord. 
And he said, These be two sons of oil shining, which stand nigh to the lordly governor of all earth.
