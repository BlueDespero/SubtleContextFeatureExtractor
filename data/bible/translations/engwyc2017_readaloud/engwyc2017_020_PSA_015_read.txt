PSALMS.
Chapter 15.
The psalm of David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle; either who shall rest in thine holy hill? 
He that entereth without wem; and worketh rightfulness or rightwise-ness. He that speaketh truth in his heart; 
which did not guile in his tongue. Nor did evil to his neighbour; and took not reproof against his neighbours. 
A wicked man is brought to nought in his sight; but he glorifieth them that dread the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth him not; 
which gave not his money to usury; and took not gifts upon the innocent. He, that doeth these things, shall not be moved without end.
