EXODUS.
Chapter 11.
And the Lord said to Moses, Yet I shall touch Pharaoh and Egypt with one vengeance, and after these things he shall deliver you, and he shall constrain you to go out. 
Therefore thou shalt say to all the people, that a man ask of his friend, and a woman of her neighbouress, silver vessels and golden, and clothes; 
forsooth the Lord shall give grace to his people before the Egyptians. And Moses was a full great man in the land of Egypt, before the servants of Pharaoh and all the people; 
and he said, The Lord saith these things, At midnight I shall enter into Egypt; 
and each first begotten thing in the land of Egyptians shall die, from the first begotten of Pharaoh, that sitteth in the throne of him, till to the first begotten of the handmaid, which is at the quern; and all the first engendered of beasts shall die; 
and a great cry shall be in all the land of Egypt, what manner cry was not before, neither shall be afterward. 
Forsooth at all the children of Israel, a dog shall not make privy noise, from man till to beast; that ye know by how great miracle the Lord parteth the Egyptians and Israel. 
And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and they shall pray me, and shall say, Go out thou, and all the people which is subject to thee; after these things we shall go out. And Moses full wroth went out from Pharaoh. 
Forsooth the Lord said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not hear you, that many signs be made in the land of Egypt. 
Soothly Moses and Aaron made all the signs and wonders, that be here written, before Pharaoh; and the Lord made hard the heart of Pharaoh, neither he delivered the sons of Israel from his land.
