Chapter 6.
To the overcomer in psalms, the psalm of David, on the eighth. Lord, reprove thou not me in thy strong vengeance; neither chastise thou me in thine ire. 
Lord, have thou mercy on me, for I am sick; Lord, make thou me whole, for all my bones be troubled. 
And my soul is troubled greatly; but thou, Lord, how long? 
Lord, be thou converted or turned again, and deliver my soul; make thou me safe, for thy mercy. 
For none there is in death, that is mindful of thee; but in hell who shall acknowledge to thee? 
I travailed in my wailing, I shall wash my bed by each night; I shall moisten, either make wet, my bedstraw with my tears. 
Mine eye is troubled of strong vengeance; I waxed eld or old among all mine enemies. 
All ye that work wickedness, depart from me; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
The Lord hath heard my beseech-ing; the Lord hath received my prayer. 
All mine enemies be ashamed, and be troubled greatly; be they turned altogether, and be they ashamed full swiftly.
