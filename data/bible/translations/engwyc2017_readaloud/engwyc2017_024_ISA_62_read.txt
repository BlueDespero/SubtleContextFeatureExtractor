ISAIAH.
Chapter 62.
For Zion I shall not be still, and for Jerusalem I shall not rest, till the just or rightwiseman thereof go out as shining, and the saviour thereof be tended as a lamp. 
And heathen men shall see thy just or rightwiseman, and all kings shall see thy noble man; and a new name, which the mouth of the Lord named, shall be called to thee. 
And thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a diadem of the realm in the hand of thy God. 
Thou shalt no more be called forsaken, and thy land shall no more be called desolate; but thou shalt be called My will in that, and thy land That that shall be inhabited; for it pleased the Lord in thee, and thy land shall be inhabited. 
For a young man shall dwell with a virgin, and thy sons shall dwell in thee; and the spouse shall have joy on the spousess, and thy God shall have joy on thee. 
Jerusalem, I have ordained keepers on thy walls, all day and all night without end they shall not be still. Ye that think on the Lord, be not still, 
and give ye not silence to him, till he stablish, and till he set Jeru-salem praising in the earth. 
The Lord swore in his right hand, and in the arm of his strength, I shall no more give thy wheat to be meat to thine enemies, and alien sons shall not drink thy wine, in which thou hast travailed. 
For they that shall gather it together, shall eat it, and shall praise the Lord; and they that bear it together, shall drink in mine holy foreyards. 
Pass ye, pass ye by the gates; make ye ready a way to the people, make ye a plain path; and choose ye the stones, and raise ye up a sign to peoples. 
Lo! the Lord made heard in the last parts of the earth. Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Lo! thy saviour cometh; lo! his meed is with him, and his work is before him. 
And they shall call them the holy people, again-bought of the Lord. Forsooth thou shalt be called a city sought, and not forsaken.
