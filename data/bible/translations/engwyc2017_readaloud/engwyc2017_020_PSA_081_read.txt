PSALMS.
Chapter 81.
To the overcomer, on the pressersor wine presses, the psalmof Asaph. Make ye fully joy or Full out joyeth to God, our helper; sing ye heartily to God of Jacob. 
Take ye a psalm, and give ye a tympan; a merry psaltery with an harp. 
Blow ye with a trump in the new moon; in the noble day of your solemnity. 
For why commandment is in Israel; and doom is to God of Jacob. 
He setted or put that witnessing in Joseph; when he went out of the land of Egypt, he heard a language, that he knew not. 
He turned away his back from burdens; his hands served in a coffin. 
In tribulation thou inwardly called-est me, and I delivered thee; I heard thee in the hid place of tempest, I proved thee at the waters of against-saying. 
My people, hear thou me, and I shall be witness against thee; Israel, if thou hearest me, 
a fresh God shall not be in thee; and thou shalt not worship an alien god. 
For I am thy Lord God, that led thee out of the land of Egypt; make large thy mouth, and I shall fill it. 
And my people heard not my voice; and Israel gave not attention to me. 
And I let them go after the desires of their heart; they shall go in their findings. 
If my people had heard me; if Israel had gone in my ways. 
For not in hap I had made low their enemies; and I had sent mine hand on men doing tribulation to them. 
The enemies of the Lord lied or lay down to him; and their time shall be into worlds. 
And he fed them with the fatness of wheat; and he ful filled them with honey of the stone.
