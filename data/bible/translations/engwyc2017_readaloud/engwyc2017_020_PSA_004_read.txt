PSALMS.
Chapter 4.
To the victory, in organs, the psalm of David. When I inwardly called, God of my rightwiseness heard me; in tribulation thou hast alarged to me. Have thou mercy on me; and hear thou my prayer. 
Sons of men, how long be ye of heavy heart? why love ye vanity, and seek leasing? 
And know ye, that the Lord hath made marvellous his holy man; the Lord shall hear me, when I shall cry to him. 
Be ye wroth, and do not ye sin; and for those evils to which ye say in your hearts and in your beds, be ye compunct. 
Sacrifice ye the sacrifice or Offer ye an offering of rightfulness or right-wiseness, and hope ye in the Lord; 
many say, Who showed good things to us? Lord, the light of thy cheer is marked upon us; 
thou hast given gladness in mine heart. They be multiplied of the fruit of wheat, and of wine; and of their oil. 
In peace in the same thing; I shall sleep, and take rest. For thou, Lord; hast set me singularly or only in hope.
