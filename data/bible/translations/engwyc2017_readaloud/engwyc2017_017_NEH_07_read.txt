NEHEMIAH.
Chapter 7.
And after that the wall of Jeru-salem was builded, and I had set up the gates thereof, and had numbered the porters, and singers, and deacons or Levites, 
I commanded to Hanani, my brother, and to Hananiah, the prince of the house of Jerusalem; for he seemed a soothfast man, and dreading God more than other men did; 
and I said to them, The gates of Jerusalem be not opened till to the heat of the sun; and, when I was yet present, the gates were closed, and locked. And I set keepers thereof of the dwellers of Jerusalem, all men by their whiles, or times, and each man over against his own house. 
And the city was full broad and great, and little people in the midst thereof, and the houses were not yet builded. 
And God gave in mine heart, and I gathered together the principal men, and magistrates, and the common people, for to number them; and I found a book of the numbering of them, that had gone up first from the captivity. And it was found written therein,
