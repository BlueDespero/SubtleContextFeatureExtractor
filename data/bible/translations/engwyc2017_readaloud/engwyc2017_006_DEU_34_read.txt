DEUTERONOMY.
Chapter 34.
Therefore Moses went up from the field places of Moab upon the hill of Nebo, into the top of Pisgah, against Jericho. And the Lord showed to him all the land of Gilead, till to Dan, 
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and of Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the last, or furtherest, sea; 
and the south part, and the breadth of the field of Jericho, of the city of Palms, till to Zoar. 
And the Lord said to him, This is the land for which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I said, I shall give it to thy seed; thou hast seen it with thine eyes, and thou shalt not pass over to it. 
And Moses, the servant of the Lord, was dead there, in the land of Moab, for the Lord commanded. 
And the Lord buried him in a valley of the land of Moab, against Bethpeor; and no man knew his sepulchre unto this day. 
Moses was of an hundred and twenty years when he died; his eye dimmed not, neither his teeth were stirred. 
And the sons of Israel bewept him thirty days in the field places of Moab; and the days of wailing of men bemourning Moses were fulfilled. 
Soothly Joshua, the son of Nun, was full-filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had put his hands upon him; and the sons of Israel obeyed to Joshua, and did as the Lord commanded to Moses. 
And a prophet rose no more in Israel as Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, 
in all the miracles, and great wonders, which the Lord sent, or did, by him, that he should do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
and all the strong hand, or power, and the great marvels, which Moses did before all Israel. Here endeth Pentateuch, see now the prologue of Joshua.
