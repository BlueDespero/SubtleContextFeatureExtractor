PSALMS.
Chapter 108.
The song of the psalm of David. Mine heart is ready, God, mine heart is ready; I shall sing, and I shall say psalm in my glory. 
My glory, rise thou up, psaltery and harp, rise thou up; I shall rise up early. 
Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee among peoples; and I shall say psalm to thee among nations. 
For why, God, thy mercy is great on heavens; and thy truth is till to the clouds. 
God, be thou enhanced above heavens; and thy glory over all earth. 
That thy darlings be delivered, make thou safe with thy right hand, and hear thou me; 
God spake in his holy place. I shall make full out joy, and I shall part Shechem; and I shall mete or measure the great valley of tabernacles. 
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; and Ephraim is the up-taking of mine head. Judah is my king; 
Moab is the cauldron of mine hope. Into Idumea I shall stretch forth my shoe; aliens be made friends to me. 
Who shall lead me forth into a strong city; who shall lead me forth till into Idumea? 
Whether not thou, God, that hast put us away; and, God, shalt thou not go out in our virtues or hosts? 
Give thou help to us out of tribulation; for the help of man is vain. 
We shall make virtue in God; and he shall bring our enemies to nought.
