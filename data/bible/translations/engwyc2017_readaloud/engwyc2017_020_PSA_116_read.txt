Chapter 116.
Alleluia. I loved the Lord; for the Lord shall hear the voice of my prayer. 
For he bowed down his ear to me; and I shall inwardly call him in my days. 
The sorrows of death encompass-ed me; and the perils of hell found me. I found tribulation and sorrow; 
and I called inwardly the name of the Lord. Thou, Lord, deliver my soul; 
the Lord is merciful, and just or rightwise; and our God doeth mercy. 
And the Lord keepeth little children; I was meeked, and he delivered me. 
My soul, turn thou into thy rest; for the Lord hath done well to thee. 
For he hath delivered my soul from death; mine eyes from weepings, and my feet from falling down. 
I shall please the Lord; in the country of them that live. 
I believed, for which thing I spake; forsooth I was made low full much. 
I said in my passing; Each man is a liar. 
What shall I yield to the Lord; for all things which he hath yielded to me? 
I shall take the cup of health; and I shall inwardly call the name of the Lord. 
I shall yield my vows to the Lord before all his people; 
the death of saints of the Lord is precious in his sight. 
O! Lord, for I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds, 
to thee I shall offer a sacrifice of praising; and I shall inwardly call the name of the Lord. 
I shall yield my vows to the Lord, in the sight of all his people; 
in the foreyards of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, Jerusalem.
