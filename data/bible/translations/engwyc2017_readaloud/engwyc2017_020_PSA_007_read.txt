Chapter 7.
For the ignorance of David, which he sang to the Lord, on the words of Ethiopian, the son of Benjamin. My Lord God, I have hoped in thee; make thou me safe from all that pursue me, and deliver thou me. 
Lest any time he as a lion ravish my soul; while none there is that again-buyeth, neither that maketh safe. 
My Lord God, if I did this thing, if wickedness is in mine hands, or works; 
if I yielded to men yielding to me evils, fall I by deserving void from mine enemies; 
mine enemy pursue he my soul, and take he, and defoul my life in earth; and bring my glory into dust. 
Lord, rise thou up in thine ire; and be thou raised up in the coasts of mine enemies. And, my Lord God, rise thou up in the commandment, which thou hast commanded; 
and the synagogue of peoples shall encompass thee. And for this go thou again on high; 
the Lord deemeth peoples. Lord, deem thou me by my rightfulness or rightwiseness; and by mine innocence on me. 
The wickedness of sinners be ended; and thou, God, seeking the hearts, that is, thoughts, and reins, that is, delightings, shall dress a just or rightwise man. 
My just or rightwise help is of the Lord; that maketh safe rightful men in heart. 
The Lord is a just or rightwise judge, strong and patient; whether he is wroth by all days? 
If ye be not converted, he shall flourish his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 
And therein he hath made ready the vessels of death; he hath fully made his arrows with burning things. 
Lo! the wicked hath conceived sorrow; he painfully hath brought forth unrightfulness or unrightwiseness, and he hath childed wickedness. 
He opened a pit, and digged it out; and he fell into the ditch which he made. 
His sorrow shall be turned into his head; and his wickedness shall come down into his neck. 
I shall acknowledge to the Lord by his rightfulness or rightwiseness; and I shall sing to the name of the highest Lord.
