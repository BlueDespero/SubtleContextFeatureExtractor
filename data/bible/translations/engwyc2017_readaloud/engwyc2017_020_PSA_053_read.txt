Chapter 53.
To the overcomer, by the quire or choir, the learning of David. The unwise man said in his heart, God is not. They be corrupt, and made abom-inable in their wickednesses; none is that doeth good. 
God beheld from heaven on the sons of men; that he see, if there is any understanding, either seeking God. 
All bowed away, they be made unprofitable altogether; none is that doeth good, there is not till to one. 
Whether all men, that work wicked-ness, shall not know; which devour my people, as the meat of bread? They called not God; 
there they trembled for dread, where no dread was. For God hath scattered the bones of them, that please men; they be shamed, for God hath forsaken them. 
Who shall give from Zion health to Israel? when the Lord hath turned the captivity of his people, Jacob shall full out make joy, and Israel shall be glad.
