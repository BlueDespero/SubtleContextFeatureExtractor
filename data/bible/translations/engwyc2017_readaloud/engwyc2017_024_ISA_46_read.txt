ISAIAH.
Chapter 46.
Bel is broken, Nebo is all-broken; their simulacra like to wild beasts and work beasts be broken; your burdens with heavy charge till to weariness were rotten, 
and be all-broken together; those might not save the bearer, and the soul of them shall go into captivity. 
The house of Jacob, and all the residue of the house of Israel, hear ye me, which be borne of my womb, which be borne of my womb. 
Till to eld I myself, and till to hoar hairs, I shall bear; I made, and I shall bear, and I shall save. 
To whom have ye likened me, and made even, and have comparisoned me, and have made like? 
Which bear together gold from the bag, and weigh silver with a balance, and hire a goldsmith to make a god, and they fall down, and worship; 
they bearing bear in shoulders, and setting in his place; and he shall stand, and shall not be moved from his place; but also when they cry to him, he shall not hear, and he shall not save them from tribulation. 
Have ye mind of this, and be ye ashamed; ye trespassers, go again to the heart. 
Bethink ye on the former world, for I am God, no God is over me, neither is like me. 
And I tell from the beginning the last thing, and from the beginning those things that be not made yet; and I say, My counsel shall stand, and all my will shall be done. 
And I call a bird from the east, and the man of my will from a far land; and I spake, and I shall bring that thing; I have made of nought, and I shall make that thing. 
Ye of hard heart, hear me, that be far from rightfulness or rightwiseness. 
I made nigh mine rightfulness or rightwiseness, it shall not be drawn afar, and mine health shall not tarry; I shall give health in Zion, and my glory in Israel.
