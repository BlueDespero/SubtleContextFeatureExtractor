PSALMS.
Chapter 23.
The psalm of David. The Lord governeth me, and nothing shall fail to me; 
in the place of pasture there he hath set me. He nourished me on the water of refreshing; 
he converted my soul. He led me forth on the paths of rightfulness or rightwiseness; for his name. 
For why though I shall go in the midst of shadow of death; I shall not dread evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff; those have comforted me. 
Thou hast made ready a board in my sight; against them that trouble me. Thou hast made fat mine head with oil; and my cup, that filleth greatly, is full clear. 
And thy mercy shall follow me; in all the days of my life. And that I dwell in the house of the Lord; into the length of days.
