2ND CORINTHIANS.
Chapter 13.
Lo! this third time I come to you, and in the mouth of two or of three witnesses every word shall stand. 
I said before, and say before, as present twice, and now absent, to them that before have sinned, and to all others; for if I come again, I shall not spare. 
Whether ye seek the proof or assaying of that Christ, that speaketh in me, which is not feeble in you, but is mighty in you? 
For though he was crucified of infirmity, but he liveth of the virtue of God. For also we be sick in him, but we shall live with him of the virtue of God in us. 
Assay yourselves, if ye be in the faith; ye yourselves prove. Whether ye know not yourselves, for Christ Jesus is in you? but in hap ye be reprovable. 
But I hope, that ye know, that we be not reprovable. 
And we pray the Lord, that ye do nothing of evil; not that we seem proved, but that ye do that that is good, and that we be as reprovable. 
For we may do nothing against truth, but, for the truth. 
For we joy, when we be sick, but ye be mighty; and we pray this thing, your perfection. 
Therefore I absent write these things, that I present do not harder, by the power, which the Lord gave to me into edification, and not into your destruction. 
Brethren, henceforward joy ye, be ye perfect, excite ye or and teach ye; understand ye the same thing; have ye peace, and God of peace and of love shall be with you. 
Greet ye well together in holy kiss. 
All holy men greet you well. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communing of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
