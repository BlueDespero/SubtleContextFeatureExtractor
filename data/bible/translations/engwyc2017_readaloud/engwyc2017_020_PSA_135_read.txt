Chapter 135.
Alleluia. Praise ye the name of the Lord; ye servants of the Lord, praise ye. 
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord; in the halls or foreyards of the house of our God. 
Praise ye the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing ye to his name, for it is sweet. 
For the Lord chose Jacob to him-self; and Israel into possession to himself. 
For I have known, that the Lord is great; and our God before all gods. 
The Lord made all things, what-ever things he would, in heaven and in earth; in the sea, and in all depths of waters. 
He led out clouds from the farthest part of the earth; and made light-nings into rain. Which bringeth forth winds from his treasures or treasuries; 
which killed the first begotten things of Egypt, from man unto beast. 
He sent out signs and great wonders, in the middle of thee, thou Egypt; into Pharaoh, and into all his servants. 
Which smote many folks; and killed strong kings. 
Sihon, the king of Amorites, and Og, the king of Bashan; and all the realms of Canaan. 
And he gave the land of them heritage; to be heritage to Israel, his people. 
Lord, thy name is without end; Lord, thy memorial be in generation and into generation. 
For the Lord shall deem his people; and he shall be prayed in his servants. 
The simulacra of heathen men be silver and gold; the works of the hands of men. 
Those images have a mouth, and shall not speak; those or they have eyes, and shall not see. 
Those or they have ears, and shall not hear; for there is no spirit in the mouth of them. 
They that make those things, be made like them; and all that trust in them. 
The house of Israel, bless ye the Lord; the house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord. 
The house of Levi, bless ye the Lord; ye that dread the Lord, bless ye the Lord. 
Blessed be the Lord of Zion; that dwelleth in Jerusalem.
