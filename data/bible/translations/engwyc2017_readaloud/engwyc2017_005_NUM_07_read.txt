Chapter 7.
And it was done in the day in which Moses fulfilled, or ended, the tabernacle, and areared it, and anointed it, and hallowed it with all the vessels, or instruments, thereof, and the altar he hallowed in like manner, and the vessels thereof. 
And the princes of Israel, and the heads of meines, that were, by all lineages, the sovereigns of them that were numbered, 
offered gifts before the Lord, six wains covered, with twelve oxen; two dukes offered one wain, and each offered one ox. And they offered those wains before the tabernacle. 
Soothly the Lord said to Moses, 
Take thou of them, that they serve in the service of the tabernacle, and betake thou those things to the deacons, by the order of their service. 
And so when Moses had taken the wains, and the oxen, he betook them to the deacons or Levites. 
He gave two wains and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, after that they had need. 
He gave four other wains and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, by their offices and religion, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron, the priest. 
Forsooth he gave not wains and oxen to the sons of Kohath, for they serve in the saintuary, and bear the charges with their own shoulders. 
Therefore the dukes offered, in the hallowing of the altar, in the day in which it was anointed, their offering to the Lord, before the altar. 
And the Lord said to Moses, All the dukes by themselves offer they gifts, by all days by themselves, into the hallowing of the altar.
