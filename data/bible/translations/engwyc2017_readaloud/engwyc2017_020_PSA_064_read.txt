Chapter 64.
To victory, the psalm of David. God, hear thou my prayer, when I beseech; deliver thou my soul from dread of the enemy. 
Thou hast defended me from the covent or convent of evil-doers; from the multitude of them that work wickedness. 
For they sharpened their tongues as a sword, they bend their bow, a bitter thing; 
for to shoot in huddles, or privates, him that is unwemmed. Suddenly they shall shoot him, and they shall not dread; 
they made steadfast to themselves a wicked word. They told, that they should hide snares; they said, Who shall see them? 
They sought wickednesses; they sought, and failed not in seeking. A man nighed to a deep heart; 
and God shall be enhanced. The arrows of little men, that is, of envious men, be made the wounds of them; 
and the tongues of them be made sick against them. All men be troubled, that saw them; 
and each man dreaded. And they told the works of God; and they understood the deeds of him. 
The just or rightwise man shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in him; and all men of rightful heart shall be praised.
