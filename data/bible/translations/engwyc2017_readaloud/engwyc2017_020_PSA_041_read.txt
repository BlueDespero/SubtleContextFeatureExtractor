Chapter 41.
For victory, the song of David. Blessed is he that understandeth of the needy man and poor; the Lord shall deliver him in the evil day. 
The Lord keep him, and quicken him, and make him blessful in the land; and betake not him into the will of his enemies. 
The Lord shall bear help to him on the bed of his sorrow; thou hast oft turned all his bedstraw in his sickness. 
I said, Lord, have thou mercy on me; heal thou my soul, for I have sinned against thee. 
Mine enemies said evils to me; When shall he die, and his name shall perish? 
And if he entered for to see me, he spake vain things; his heart gathered wickedness to himself. He went with-outforth; and spake to the same thing or the same end. 
All mine enemies backbited privily against me; against me they thought evils to me. 
They ordained an evil word against me; Whether he that sleepeth, shall not lie to, that he rise again? 
For why the man of my peace, in whom I hoped, he that ate my loaves; made great deceit on me. 
But thou, Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again; and I shall yield to them. 
In this thing I knew, that thou wouldest or delightest in me; for mine enemy shall not have joy on me. 
Forsooth thou hast taken me up for mine innocence; and hast confirmed me in thy sight without end. 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from the world, and into the world; be it done, be it done.
