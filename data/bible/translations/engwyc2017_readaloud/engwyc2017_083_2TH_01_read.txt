2ND THESSALONIANS.
Chapter 1.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of Thessalonians, in God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
grace to you and peace of God, our Father, and of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We owe to do thankings ever-more to God for you, brethren, so as it is worthy, for your faith over-waxeth or ever-waxeth, and the charity of each of you to other aboundeth. 
So that we us-selves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations. Which ye sustain 
into the ensample of the just doom of God, that ye be had worthy in the kingdom of God, for which ye suffer. 
If nevertheless it is just before God to requite tribulation to them that trouble you, 
and to you that be troubled, rest with us in the showing of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with angels of his virtue, 
in the flame of fire, that shall give vengeance to them that know not God, and that obey not to the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Which shall suffer everlasting pains, in perishing from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his virtue, 
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be made wonderful in all men that believed, for our witnessing is believed on you, in that day. 
In which thing also we pray evermore for you, that our God make you worthy to his calling, and ful fill all the will of his goodness, and the work of faith in virtue; 
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be clarified in you, and ye in him, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
