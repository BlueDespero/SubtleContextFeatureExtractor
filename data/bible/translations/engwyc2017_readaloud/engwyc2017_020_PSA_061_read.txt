PSALMS.
Chapter 61.
To victory, on organs, to David himself. God, hear thou my beseech-ing; give thou attention to my prayer. 
From the ends of the land I cried to thee; the while mine heart was anguished, thou enhancedest me in a stone. Thou leddest me forth, 
for thou art made mine hope; a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. 
I shall dwell in thy tabernacle into worlds; I shall be covered in the covering of thy wings. 
For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer; thou hast given heritage to them that dread thy name. 
Thou shalt add, either increase, days onto the days of the king; his years till into the day of generation and of generation. 
He dwelleth without end in the sight of God; who shall seek the mercy and truth of him? 
So I shall say psalm to thy name into the world of world; that I yield my vows from day into day.
