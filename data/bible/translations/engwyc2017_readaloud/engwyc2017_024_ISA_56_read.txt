ISAIAH.
Chapter 56.
The Lord saith these things, Keep ye doom, and do ye rightfulness or rightwiseness, for why mine health is nigh, that it come, and my rightfulness or rightwiseness, that it be showed. 
Blessed is the man, that doeth this, and the son of a man, that shall take this; keeping the sabbath, that he defoul not it, keeping his hands, that he do not any evil. 
And say not the son of a comeling, that cleaveth fast to the Lord, saying, By parting the Lord shall part me from his people; and a gelding, either a chaste man, say not, Lo! I am a dry tree. 
For the Lord saith these things to geldings, that keep my sabbaths, and choose what things I would, and hold my bond of peace. 
I shall give to them a place in mine house, and within my walls, and the best name, of sons and daughters; I shall give to them a name everlasting, that shall not perish. 
And I shall bring in to bless the sons of a comeling, that cleave fast to the Lord, that they worship him, and love his name, that they be to him into servants; each man keeping the sabbath, that he defoul it not, and holding my bond of peace; 
I shall bring them into mine holy hill, and I shall make them glad in the house of my prayer; their burnt sacrifices and their slain sacrifices shall please me on mine altar; for why mine house shall be called an house of prayer to all peoples, 
saith the Lord God, that gathereth together the scattered men of Israel. Yet I shall gather together to him all the gathered men thereof. 
All beasts of the field, come ye to devour, all beasts of the forest. 
All the beholders thereof be blind, all they knew not; dumb dogs, that may not bark; seeing vain things, sleeping, and loving dreams; 
and most unshamefast dogs knew not fullness. Those shepherds knew not understanding; all they bowed into their way, each man to his avarice, from the highest till to the last. 
Come ye, take we wine, and be we filled of drunkenness; and it shall be as today, so and tomorrow, and much more.
