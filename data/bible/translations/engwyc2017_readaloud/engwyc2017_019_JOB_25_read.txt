JOB.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, and said, 
Power and dread is with him, that is, God, which maketh according in his high things. 
Whether there is a number of his knights? and upon whom shineth not his light? 
Whether a man comparisoned to God may be justified, either a man born of a woman may appear clean? 
Lo! also the moon shineth not, and the stars be not clean in his sight; 
how much more man, that is rot, and the son of a man, that is a worm, is unclean in comparison to God.
