EZEKIEL.
Chapter 2.
And he said to me, Thou, son of man or Son of man, stand on thy feet, and I shall speak with thee. 
And the spirit entered into me, after that he spake to me, and setted me on my feet. And I heard one speaking to me, 
and saying, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to folks apostates, either going aback from faith, that went away from me; the fathers of them brake my covenant till to this day. 
And the sons be of hard face, and of unchastiseable heart, to whom I send thee. And thou shalt say to them, The Lord God saith these things; 
if peradventure namely they hear, and if peradventure they rest, for it is an house stirring to wrath. And they shall know, that a prophet is in the midst of them. 
Therefore thou, son of man, dread not them, neither dread thou the words of them; for unbelieveful men and destroyers be with thee, and thou dwellest with scorpions. Dread thou not the words of them, and dread thou not the faces of them, for it is an house stirring to wrath. 
Therefore thou shalt speak my words to them, if peradventure they hear, and rest, for they be stirrers to wrath. 
But thou, son of man, hear what-ever things I shall speak to thee; and do not thou be a stirrer to wrath, as the house of Israel is a stirrer to wrath. Open thy mouth, and eat whatever things I give to thee. 
And I saw, and lo! an hand was sent to me, in which a book was folded together. 
And he spreaded abroad it before me, that was written within and withoutforth. And lamentations, and song, and woe, were written therein.
