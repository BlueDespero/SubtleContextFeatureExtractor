PSALMS.
Chapter 150.
Alleluia. Praise ye the Lord in his saints; praise ye him in the firmament of his virtue. 
Praise ye him in his virtues; praise ye him by the multitude of his greatness. 
Praise ye him in the sound of a trump; praise ye him in a psaltery and harp. 
Praise ye him in a tympan and quire; praise ye him in strings and organ. 
Praise ye him in cymbals sounding well, praise ye him in cymbals of jubilation; 
each spirit, praise the Lord.
