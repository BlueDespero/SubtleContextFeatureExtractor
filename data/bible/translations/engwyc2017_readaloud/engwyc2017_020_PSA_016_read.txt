Chapter 16.
Of the meek and simple, the psalm of David. Lord, keep thou me, for I have hoped in thee; 
I said to the Lord, Thou art my God; for thou hast no need of my goods. 
To the saints that be in the land of him; he made wonderful all my wills in them. 
The sicknesses of them be multi-plied; afterward they hasted. I shall not gather together the conventicles, or small covents, of them of bloods; and I shall not be mindful of their names by my lips. 
The Lord isthe part of mine heritage, and of my passion; thou art, that shall restore mine heritage to me. 
Cords felled to me in full clear things; for mine heritage is full clear to me. 
I shall bless the Lord, that hath given understanding to me; furthermore and my reins have blamed me unto the night. 
I saw before me evermore the Lord in my sight; for he is at the right half to me, that I be not moved. 
For this thing mine heart was glad, and my tongue joyed fully; further-more and my flesh shall rest in hope. 
For thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; neither thou shalt give thine holy man to see corruption. 
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt full-fill me with gladness with thy cheer; delight-ings be in thy right half unto the end.
