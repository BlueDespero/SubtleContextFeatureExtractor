Colossians.
Chapter 4.
Masters, provide to your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the heavens. 
Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving; 
praying at the same time also for us, that God would open a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, because of which I am also in chains, 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, redeeming the time. 
Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, to know how you ought to answer each one. 
Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all things about me. 
I am sending him to you for this very thing, that he may know your circumstances, and he may encourage your hearts, 
with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all the things happening here. 
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, receive him), 
and Jesus who is called Justus. These alone are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me. 
Epaphras greets you, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, always struggling for you in his prayers, that you may stand mature and complete in all the will of God. 
For I bear him witness that he has much zeal for you, and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis. 
Luke the beloved physician greets you, also Demas. 
Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church in his house. 
And whenever this letter is read before you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the one from Laodicea. 
And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.” 
This greeting by my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
