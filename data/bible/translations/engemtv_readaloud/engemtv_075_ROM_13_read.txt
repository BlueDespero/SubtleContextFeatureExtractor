Romans.
Chapter 13.
Let every person submit to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except by God, and the authorities that exist are established by God. 
Consequently the one resisting the authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and those opposing shall receive judgment to themselves. 
For rulers are not a fear to good works, but to evil. And do you wish not to fear the authority? Do what is good, and you shall have praise from the same. 
For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do evil, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's servant, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 
Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also for conscience' sake. 
For on account of this you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 
Render therefore to all their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. 
Owe nothing to no one, except to love one another, for he who loves one another has fulfilled the law. 
For, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, in this word it is summed up, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. 
And do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for us to be roused out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. 
The night is advanced, the day is at hand. Therefore let us put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. 
Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelries and drinking bouts, not in orgies and debaucheries, not in strife and jealousy. 
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts.
