Hebrews.
Chapter 3.
Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ, 
who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house. 
For He has been counted worthy of more honor than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house. 
For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God. 
And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things which would be spoken, 
but Christ was faithful as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the boast of hope firm until the end. 
Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you will hear His voice, 
Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness, 
Where your fathers tested Me, they tried Me, and saw My works forty years. 
Therefore I was indignant with that generation, and said, ‘They go astray in their heart, and they did not know My ways.’ 
So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ” 
Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; 
but encourage yourselves every day, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
For we have become partakers of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm until the end, 
while it is said: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” 
For some, having heard, did provoke: but not all who came out of Egypt through Moses. 
And with whom was He indignant those forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 
And to whom did He swear that they would not enter into His rest, except to those who disobeyed? 
And we see that they were not able to enter on account of unbelief.
