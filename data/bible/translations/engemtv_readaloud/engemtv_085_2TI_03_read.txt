2 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
But know this, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, not loving what is good, 
traitors, headstrong, having been puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from these people turn away! 
For of these are those who creep into houses and captivate gullible women having been loaded down with sins, who are led by various lusts, 
always learning and never being able to come to a full knowledge of the truth. 
And in just the way Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, thus also these resist the truth: men corrupted in mind, disapproved regarding the faith. 
But they shall not advance further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as also theirs became. 
You however have carefully followed my doctrine, lifestyle, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
persecutions, and afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, in Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. 
Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
But evil men and impostors shall advance worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you learned them, 
and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 
that the man of God may be proficient, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
