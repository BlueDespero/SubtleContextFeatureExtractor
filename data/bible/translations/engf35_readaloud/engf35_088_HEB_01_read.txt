The Epistle [of Paul] to the Hebrews.
Chapter 1.
God, having spoken to the fathers through the prophets in many parts and in various ways, in the past, 
has at the end of these days spoken to us by Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the ages; 
who being the projection of His glory and the very image of His essence, and sustaining all things by the expression of HisS own power, when He had by Himself provided purification for our sins He sat down on the highest Majesty's right, 
having become so much superior to the angels as He has inherited a more excellent name than they have. 
For to which of the angels did HeF ever say, “You are my Son, today I begot you,” and again, “I will be ‘Father’ to Him, and He will be ‘Son’ to me?” 
Again, when He introduces the Firstborn into the inhabited earth He says, “Let all God's angels worship HimS.” 
Further, about the angels HeF says, “Who makes His angels winds, His servants flames of fire”; 
while to the Son He says: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; ‘Scepter of Uprightness’ is the scepter of Your kingdom. 
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultation beyond Your companions.” 
Also: “You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are works of Your hands; 
they will perish but You continue on —they will all grow old like a garment; 
You will roll them up like a cloak and they will be changed, while You stay the same and Your years will never end.” 
On the other hand, to which of the angels did He ever say, “Sit on my right until I place your enemies as a stool under your feet”? 
Are they not all ministering spirits being sent to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?
