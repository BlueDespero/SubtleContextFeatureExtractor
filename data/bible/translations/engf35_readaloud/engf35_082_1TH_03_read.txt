1 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
So when we could not stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone 
and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, also our fellow worker in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and encourage you concerning your faith, 
that no one be unsettled by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. 
For indeed, when we were with you we kept telling you in advance that we were going to be afflicted; just as it happened, in fact, as you know. 
Yes, that is why, no longer standing it, I sent to find out about your faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had successfully tempted you and our labor come to be for nothing. 
But now that Timothy has come to us from you and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, just as we also long to see you 
—because of this, brothers, in all our affliction and distress we were encouraged about you by your faith; 
for now we live, if you are standing firm in the Lord. 
With what thankfulness can we repay God for you, for all the joy with which we are rejoicing in the presence of our God because of you; 
praying most earnestly night and day, that we may see your face and complete the things lacking in your faith? 
Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you. 
And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love toward each other and toward all, just as we also do toward you, 
so as to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His holy ones.
