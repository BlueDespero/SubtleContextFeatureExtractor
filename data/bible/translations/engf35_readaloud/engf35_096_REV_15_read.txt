Revelation.
Chapter 15.
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues—in them the fury of God is completed. 
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who prevailed over the Beast and over his image and over the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God. 
They sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: “Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God, the Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations! 
Who could not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy; because all the nations will come and do obeisance before You, because Your righteous judgments have been manifested.” 
After these things I looked, and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven was opened. 
And out from that heaven came the seven angels, the ones having the seven plagues; they were clothed in pure bright linen and were girded around the chests with golden belts. 
Then one of the four living beings gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the fury of God, the One who lives forever and ever. 
The sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to go into the sanctuary until the seven angels' plagues were completed.
