1 Timothy.
Chapter 4.
Now the Spirit says explicitly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceiving spirits and to things taught by demons 
—through hypocritical liars whose own consciences have been cauterized, 
who forbid to marry and to eat foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and really know the truth. 
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 
because it is consecrated through the Word of God and prayer. 
If you instruct the brothers in these things you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, brought up in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have faithfully followed. 
But reject godless myths and old-wives' tales; rather, exercise yourself toward godliness. 
Now physical exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, holding promises for both this present life and the one to come. 
Here is a trustworthy word, worthy of total acceptance 
(which is also why we labor and suffer reproach): We have set our hope on the living God, who is ‘Savior of all men’, especially of those who believe. 
Command and teach these things. 
Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
Until I come give attention to public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. 
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was ‘given’ to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the body of elders. 
Cultivate these things; give yourself wholly to them, so that your progress may be evident to all. 
Take pains with yourself and the doctrine; persevere in those things, because by doing so you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
