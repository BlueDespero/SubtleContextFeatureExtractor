Titus.
Chapter 3.
Remind them to subordinate themselves to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, 
to slander no one, to be peaceable, gentle, demonstrating true humility to all men. 
Because we ourselves were also foolish at one time, disobedient, being deceived, being enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, detestable, hating one another. 
But when the kindness of our Savior God and His love toward mankind manifested itself, 
He saved us—not because of righteous deeds that we ourselves had done but according to His mercy, by means of the bath of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 
whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
so that having been justified by His grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
The above is a trustworthy statement and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be concerned to take the lead in good works. These things are good and profitable for mankind. 
But avoid foolish arguments and genealogies and contentions and disputes about the law, because they are unprofitable and useless. 
Excommunicate a divisive man after a first and second admonition, 
knowing that such a person has been perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned. 
As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to spend the winter there. 
Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way without delay, that they may lack nothing. 
And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet pressing needs, that they not be unfruitful. 
All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
