2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, as also with you, 
and that we may be delivered from evil and malignant men; for not all have faith. 
But the Lord is faithful, who will strengthen you and guard you from the malignant one. 
We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command. 
Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the perseverance of Christ. 
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who behaves irresponsibly and not according to the tradition that they received from us. 
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we did not behave irresponsibly among you; 
neither did we eat anyone's bread without paying; rather we worked night and day, with difficulty and hardship, so as not to be a burden to any of you; 
not because we do not have the right, but in order to offer ourselves to you as a model for you to imitate. 
Yes, because when we were with you we gave you this command: “If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat!” 
Yet we hear that some among you are behaving irresponsibly; not working, just meddling. 
Now to such individuals we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread. 
But as for you, brothers, do not lose heart in well doing. 
If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and do not associate with him, that he may be shamed; 
yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you the peace during every situation, in every way. The Lord be with you all. 
The greeting of Paul, with my own hand, which is the ‘trademark’ in every letter that I write. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
