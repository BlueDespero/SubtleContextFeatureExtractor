BARUCH.
Chapter 5.
Jerusalem, unclothe thee of the stole of thy mourning, and travailing or of thy travail; and clothe thou thee in or with the fairness, and (the) honour of it, which is of (or from) God to thee in everlasting glory or that is to thee of (or from) God in everlasting glory. 
God of rightfulness or rightwise-ness shall (en)compass thee with a double cloth (or a double cloak), and shall set or put on thine head a mitre of everlasting honour. 
For God shall show his brightness in (or to) thee, which is under heaven. 
For thy name shall be named of (or by) God to thee without end, The peace of rightfulness or rightwise-ness, and The honour of piety. 
Jerusalem, rise up, and stand in an high place or stand in (or on) high, and behold about to the east; and see thy sons gathered together from the sun rising till to the west, in (or by) the word of the Holy (One), that make joy in the mind of God. 
For they went out from thee, and were led (away) of enemies on feet (or were led away on foot by their enemies); but the Lord shall bring to thee them borne into honour, as the sons of (the) realm or the sons of (the) kingdom. 
For God hath ordained to make low each high hill, and (the) ever-lasting rocks of stones, and great valleys, to fill the unevenness of (the) earth; (so) that Israel (may) go diligently into the honour of God. 
Forsooth the woods, and each tree of sweetness, (over)shadowed Israel, by the commandment of God. 
For God shall bring Israel with mirth, into or in the light of his majesty, with mercy and rightfulness or right-wiseness, which is of (or from) him.
