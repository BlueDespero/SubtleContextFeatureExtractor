Chapter 123.
The song of degrees. To thee I have raised mine eyes; that dwellest in heavens. (A song for steps of ascending. I raise up my eyes to thee; who livest in heaven.) 
Lo! as the eyes of servants be in the hands of their lords. As the eyes of the handmaid be in the hands of her lady; so our eyes be to our Lord God, till he have mercy on us. (Behold! like the eyes of the servant (look) to the hand of his lord; and like the eyes of the servantess (look) to the hand of her lady; so let our eyes (look) to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.) 
Lord, have thou mercy on us, have thou mercy on us; for we be much filled with despising (or for we be greatly despised). 
For our soul is much filled; we be shame to them that be abundant with riches, and despising to proud men. (For our soul is filled full, with the scorn of those who have abundant riches; and with disdain from the proud.)
