ISAIAH.
Chapter 12.
And thou shalt say in that day, Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee, for thou were wroth to me; thy strong vengeance is turned, and thou hast comforted me. (And thou shalt say on that day, Lord, I shall praise thee, for though thou were angry with me, now thy strong vengeance is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.) 
Lo! God is my saviour, I shall do faithfully, and I shall not dread. For why the Lord is my strength and my praising, and he is made to me into health. (Behold! God (is) my Saviour, I shall do faithfully, and I shall not fear. For the Lord (is) my strength and my praising, and he is my deliverance, (or my salvation).) 
Ye shall draw waters with joy of the wells of the saviour. (Yea, with joy, ye shall draw water from the wells of salvation.) 
And ye shall say in that day, Acknowledge ye to the Lord, and call ye his name into help; make ye known his findings among peoples; have ye mind, that his name is high. (And ye shall say on that day, Praise ye the Lord, and call ye on his name for help or and call ye his name for help; make ye known his deeds among the peoples; remember that his name is the highest of all.) 
Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath done worshipfully (or for he hath done honourably, or for he hath done magnificently); tell ye this out in all the earth. 
Thou dwelling of Zion, make full out joy, and praise; for why the Holy of Israel is great in the midst of thee. (O inhabitants of Zion, rejoice, and praise ye; for the great Holy One of Israel is in thy midst.)
