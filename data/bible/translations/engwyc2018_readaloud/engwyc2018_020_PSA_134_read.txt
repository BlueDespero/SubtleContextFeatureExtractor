Chapter 134.
The song of degrees. Lo! now bless ye the Lord; all the servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord; in the halls/in the foreyards of the house of our God. (A song for steps of ascending. Behold! now bless ye the Lord; all the servants of the Lord. Ye who stand in the House of the Lord; night after night.) 
In nights raise your hands into holy things; and bless ye the Lord. (Raise up your hands in the holy place; and bless ye the Lord.) 
The Lord bless thee from Zion; the which Lord made heaven and earth. (May the Lord bless thee from Zion; the Lord who made heaven and earth.)
