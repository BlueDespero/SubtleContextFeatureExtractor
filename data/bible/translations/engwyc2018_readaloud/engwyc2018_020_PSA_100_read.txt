Chapter 100.
A psalm to acknowledge. All earth, sing ye heartily to God; (A song of thanksgiving. All the earth, sing ye heartily to God;) 
serve ye the Lord in gladness. Enter ye in his sight in full out joying. (serve ye the Lord with gladness. Enter ye before him with rejoicing.) 
Know ye, that the Lord himself is God; he made us, and not we made us. His people, and the sheep of his pasture, (Know ye, that the Lord himself is God; he made us, and we did not make ourselves or and we belong to him. So let his people, and the sheep of his pasture,) 
enter ye into his gates in acknowledging; enter ye into his porches, acknowledge ye to him in hymns. Praise ye his name, (enter ye his gates with praise, or thanksgiving; enter ye into his courtyards with hymns of praise. Thank ye him, and bless ye his name or and praise ye his name,) 
for the Lord is sweet, his mercy isinto without end; and his truth is in generation and into generation. (for the Lord is good, his love is forever; and his faithfulness is for all generations.)
