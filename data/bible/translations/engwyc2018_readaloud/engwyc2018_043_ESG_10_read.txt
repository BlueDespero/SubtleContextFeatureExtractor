ADDITIONS TO ESTHER.
Chapter 10.
And Mordecai said, These things be done of (or by) God. 
I have mind on a dream, which I saw, signifying these same things, and nothing of those was void. 
A little well, that waxed or grew into a flood (or a river), and was turned into light, and (the) sun, and (then was) turned again into full many waters, this well is Esther, whom the king took into wife, and would that she were his queen. 
And the two dragons, I am, and Haman; 
and (the) folks that came together, be these, that endeavoured to do away the name of (the) Jews. 
But my folk Israel it is, that cried to the Lord; and the Lord made safe his people, and he hath delivered us from all evils, and he hath done great signs, or tokens, and wonders among (the) heathen men or the Gentiles; 
and he hath commanded two lots to be, one of God’s people, and the other of all heathen men or of all (the) Gentiles. 
And then ever either lot came into a day ordained, or determined, or set, from that time before God and all folks. 
And the Lord had mind on his people, and had mercy on his heritage. 
And these days shall be kept in the month (of) Adar, or March, in the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the same month, with all busyness and joy of the people gathered into one company, into all the generations of the people of Israel afterward.
