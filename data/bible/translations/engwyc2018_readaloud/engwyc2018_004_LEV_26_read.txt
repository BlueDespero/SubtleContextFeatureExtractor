LEVITICUS.
Chapter 26.
ye shall not make to you an idol, and a graven image(or nor a carved image), neither ye shall raise up titles, that is, altars for idolatry, neither ye shall set (up) a noble stone in your land, that ye worship it; for I am your Lord God. 
Keep ye my sabbaths, and dread ye at my saintuary (or and revere my sanctuary); I am the Lord. 
If ye go in my behests, and keep my commandments, and do those, 
I shall give to you rain in their times, and the earth shall bring forth his fruit, and the trees shall be filled with apples; (I shall give you rain at the proper time, and the land shall bring forth its harvest, and the trees shall be filled with fruit;) 
the threshing of ripe corns shall take (you until) the vintage, and the vintage shall occupy (you until) the seed time, and ye shall eat your bread in fullness, and ye shall dwell in your land without dread (or and ye shall live in your land without any fear). 
I shall give peace in your coasts; ye shall sleep, and none shall be that shall make you afeared; I shall do away evil beasts from you, and a sword shall not pass by your terms. 
Ye shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall before you; 
five of your men shall pursue an hundred aliens, and an hundred of you shall pursue ten thousand; your enemies shall fall by sword in your sight (or your enemies shall fall by the sword before you). 
I shall behold you, and I shall make you to increase; ye shall be multiplied; and I shall make steadfast my covenant with you; 
ye shall eat the eldest of (the) eld things, and (then) ye shall cast away the eld things, when the new things shall come above (or when the new things shall come forth); 
I shall set my tabernacle in the midst of you, and my soul shall not cast you away; 
I shall go among you, and I shall be your God, and ye shall be a people to me (or and ye shall be my people). 
I am your Lord God, that led you out of the land of Egyptians, that ye should not serve them (any more), and I have broken the chains off your nolls, that ye should go upright. (I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of the Egyptians, so that ye would no longer serve them, and I have broken the chains from off your necks, so that ye could walk upright.) 
That if ye hear not me, neither do all my behests, (But if ye will not listen to me, nor do all my commands,) 
and if ye forsake my laws, and despise my dooms, that ye do not those things that be ordained of me, and that ye bring follily my covenant to nought, (and if ye forsake my laws, and despise my judgements, so that ye do not do those things that be ordained by me, but ye foolishly break my covenant,) 
also I shall do these things to you; I shall visit you swiftly in neediness, and in burning, which shall torment your eyes, and waste your lives; in vain ye shall sow seed, that shall be devoured of enemies; (then I shall do these things to you; I shall swiftly visit you with want, or with need, and with burning, which shall torment your eyes, and shall waste your lives; ye shall sow your seed in vain, for it shall be devoured by your enemies;) 
I shall set my face against you, and ye shall fall before your enemies, and ye shall be subjects to them that hate you (or and ye shall be made subject to them who hate you); (and) ye shall flee, while no man pursueth you. 
But if neither so ye obey to me (or And if ye shall still not obey me), I shall increase your chastising sevenfold for your sins; 
and I shall all-break the pride of your hardness, and I shall give to you heaven above as iron, and the earth as brass; (and I shall break in pieces all of your hard-headed pride; and I shall make the heavens above you like iron, and the earth beneath you like bronze;) 
your travail shall be wasted in vain, neither the earth shall bring forth fruit, neither the trees shall give apples. (all your labour shall be in vain, the land shall not bring forth any harvest, nor shall the trees give forth any fruit.) 
If ye go contrary to me, neither will hear me (or and will not listen to me), I shall increase your wounds, either vengeances, till into sevenfold for your sins; 
I shall send out into you cruel beasts of the field (or I shall send cruel wild beasts among you), that shall waste you, and your beasts, and shall bring all things to fewness, and your (by)ways shall be forsaken. 
That if neither so ye will receive doctrine, either chastising, but go contrary to me, (And if ye will still not receive chastising, or discipline, but continue to go contrary to me,) 
also I shall go adversary against you, and I shall smite you seven times for your sins; (then I shall also be your adversary or then I shall also go contrary to you, and I shall strike you seven times for your sins;) 
and I shall bring in on you the sword, venger of my bond of peace (or the avenger of my covenant); and when ye flee into your cities, I shall send pestilence into the midst of you, and ye shall be betaken in(to) the hands of your enemies, 
after that I have broken the staff of your bread, so that ten women shall bake their loaves in one oven, and (they shall) yield, or deliver, those loaves at weight; and ye shall eat (them), and (yet) ye shall not be fulfilled. 
But if neither by these things ye will hear me, but go against me, (And if, in spite of all these things, ye still will not listen to me, but continue to go against me,) 
and I shall go against you in contrary strong vengeance, and I shall chastise you by seven vengeances for your sins, (then I also shall be contrary, and go against you with strong vengeance, and I shall chastise you seven times for your sins,) 
so that ye (shall) eat the flesh of your sons, and of your daughters; 
I shall destroy your high things, and I shall break your simulacra, (or I shall destroy your high places, or your hill shrines, and I shall break your idols); ye shall fall betwixt the fallings of your idols, and my soul shall have you abominable, 
in so much that I shall turn your cities into wilderness, and make your saintuaries forsaken, neither I shall receive more the sweetest odour; (in so much that I shall turn your cities into wilderness, and make your sanctuaries forsaken, nor shall I receive from you any more the sweetest aroma;) 
and I shall destroy your land, and your enemies shall be astonished thereon, when they shall be dwellers thereof; (and I shall destroy your land, and your enemies, when they become its inhabitants, shall be astonished at what hath happened there;) 
forsooth I shall scatter you into folks, or into heathen men, and I shall draw out of the sheath the sword after you, (or yea, I shall scatter you among the heathen, and I shall draw the sword out of its sheath, and come after you), and your land shall be forsaken, and your cities shall be cast down. 
Then his sabbaths shall please the earth, in all the days of his wilderness; when ye be in the land of (your) enemies, it shall keep sabbath, (Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths, in all the days of its wilderness; while ye be in the land of your enemies, it shall keep the Sabbaths, that is, the land shall take rest,) 
and it shall rest in the sabbaths of his wilderness, for it rested not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelled therein. (yea, it shall rest on its Sabbaths in its time of wilderness, for it did not rest on your Sabbaths, when ye still lived there.) 
And I shall give dread in their hearts, that shall abide of you, in the countries of your enemies; the sound of a leaf flying shall make them afeared, and so they shall flee it as a sword; they shall fall, while none pursueth, (And I shall put fear in the hearts of those who be left of you, in the countries of your enemies; the sound of a leaf flying in the wind shall make them afraid, and they shall flee it like a sword; they shall fall, when no one pursueth them,) 
and all they shall fall upon their brethren, as men fleeing battles (out of fear); no man of you shall be hardy to against-stand (your) enemies; (and they all shall fall upon their brothers, like men fearfully fleeing from battle; not one of you shall be hardy to stand against your enemies;) 
ye shall perish among heathen men, and the land of (your) enemies shall waste you. 
That if some of these Jews dwell (or And those Jews who shall still remain), they shall fail in their wickednesses, in the land of their enemies; and they shall be tormented for the sins of their fathers, and for their own sins, 
till they acknowledge their wickednesses, and have mind of their evils (or and remember their evil-doing), by which they trespassed against me, and went contrary to me. 
Therefore and I shall go against them (or And so I shall go against them), and I shall bring them into the land of their enemies, till the uncircumcised soul of them be ashamed; then they shall pray for (the forgiveness of) their wickedness, 
and I shall have mind of my bond of peace, that I covenanted with Jacob, Isaac, and with Abraham; also I shall be mindful of the land, (and I shall remember my covenant, which I made with Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham; and I shall remember the land,) 
which, when it is left of them, shall please to itself in his sabbaths, and shall suffer wilderness for them; forsooth they shall pray for their sins, for they casted away my dooms, and despised my laws; (which, when it is rid of them, shall enjoy its Sabbaths, and shall become a wilderness without them; and they shall pray for the forgiveness of their sins, for they threw away my judgements, and despised my laws;) 
nevertheless, yea, when they were in the land of (their) enemies, I casted not them away utterly (or I did not utterly throw them away), neither I despised them, so that they were wasted, and that I made void my covenant with them; for I am the Lord God of them. 
And I shall have mind of my former bond of peace (or And I shall remember my covenant with their ancestors), when I led them out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of heathen men, that I should be their God; I am the Lord God. 
These be the behests, and dooms, and laws, which the Lord gave betwixt himself and the sons of Israel, in the hill of Sinai, by the hand of Moses. (These be the commands, and judgements, and laws, which the Lord gave between himself and the Israelites, on Mount Sinai, through Moses.)
