Chapter 133.
The song of degrees. Lo! how good and how merry it is; that brethren dwell together. (A song for steps of ascending. Behold! how good and how pleasant it is; for brothers, or for God’s people, to live together in unity, or in harmony.) 
As ointment in the head; that goeth down into the beard, into the beard of Aaron. That goeth down into the collar of his cloth; (Like ointment on the head, that goeth down onto the beard, onto Aaron’s beard; yea, that goeth down onto the collar of his cloak.) 
as the dew of Hermon, that goeth down into the hill of Zion. For there the Lord sent blessing; and life till into the world, that is, without end. (Like the dew of Mount Hermon, that goeth down onto the hills of Zion. For there the Lord sent blessing; and life forevermore.)
