Ephesians.
Chapter 3.
For this cause I Paul a in the bodes of Iesus christ for youre sakes which are hethen: 
Yf ye have hearde of the ministracion of the grace of god which is geven me to you warde. 
For by revelacion shewed he this mistery vnto me as I wrote above in feawe wordes 
wher by when ye rede ye maye knowe myne vnderstondynge in the mistery of Christ 
which mistery in tymes passed was not opened vnto the sonnes of men as it is nowe declared vnto his holy apostles and prophetes by the sprete: 
that the gentyls shuld be inheritours also and of the same body and partakers of his promis that is in Christ by the meanes of the gospell 
whereof I am made a minister by the gyfte of the grace of god geve vnto me thorow the workynge of his power. 
Vnto me the lest of all sayntes is this grace geven that I shuld preache amonge the gentyls the unsearchable ryches of Christ 
and to make all men se what the felyshippe of the mistery is which from the begynnynge of the worlde hath bene hid in God which made all thynges thorow Iesus Christ 
to the intent that now vnto the rulars and powers in heven myght be knowe by the congregacion the many folde wisdome of god 
accordinge to the eternall purpose which he purposed in Christ Iesu oure lorde 
by whom we are bolde to drawe nye in ye trust which we have by faith on him. 
Wherfore I desire that ye faynt not because of my trybulacions for youre sakes: which is youre prayse. 
For this cause I bowe my knees vnto the father of oure lorde Iesus Christ 
which is father over all that ys called father In heven and in erth 
that he wolde graunt you acordynge to the ryches of his glory that ye maye be strenghted with myght by his sprete in the inner man 
that Christ maye dwell in youre hertes by fayth that ye beynge roted and grounded in loue 
myght be able to comprehende with all sayntes what ys that bredth and length deepth and heyth: 
and to knowe what is the love of Christ which love passeth knowledge: that ye might be fulfilled with all manner of fulnes which commeth of God. 
Vnto him that is able to do excedynge aboudantly above all that we axe or thynke accordynge to the power that worketh in vs 
be prayse in the congregacion by Iesus Christ thorow out all generacios from tyme to tyme Amen.
