Psalm 151.
Chapter 1.
This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though supernumerary, composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath. I was small among my brethren, And youngest in my father’s house: I tended my father’s sheep. 
My hands formed a musical instrument, And my fingers tuned a psaltery. 
And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself heareth. 
He sent forth his angel, And took me from my father’s sheep, And he anointed me with the oil of his anointing. 
My brethren were handsome and tall; But the Lord did not take pleasure in them. 
I went forth to meet the Philistine; And he cursed me by his idols. 
But I drew his own sword, and beheaded him, And removed reproach from the children of Israel.
