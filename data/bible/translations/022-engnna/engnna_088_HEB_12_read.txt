Hebrews.
Chapter 12.
Lots of people from long ago are watching us. Therefore let us throw away everything that slows us down from doing good, the bad things also that hold onto us tightly. Let us follow Jesus continually, let us think about him always. He causes us to truly believe in God from beginning to end. To die nailed up on the tree is a shameful thing. Jesus knew about this, he did not back off, he was thinking that later God would make him very happy, he ignored that shame. Now he is sitting really close to God.
