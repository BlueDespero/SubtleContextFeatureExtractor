Galatians.
Chapter 6.
Fellow Christians, you know what God wants. Maybe one of the Christians will do something bad. You must pay attention to the Holy Spirit, after that you will show that Christian the good way, gently. You will do it thoughtfully – you will not do like that one did. 
You should have pity on those who have problems. When you do that you will do according to Christ's word. 
You should not become self-opinionated. Perhaps some small/unimportant people will say to themselves, “I am big/important.” When they say that they are deceiving themselves. Truly they are only small/unimportant. 
You should continually say to yourself, “How was it? Did I do that in accordance with God's word?” Perhaps it was good. Then you will be contented. Do not say to yourself, “Those others were doing badly, I'm doing fairly well.” 
You should do your own (work) properly. That's what God wants. Don't look at others in order to criticise. 
Perhaps a person will teach you about God's word. In response you should give food and money and clothes and those sorts of things to your teacher. 
Listen! A person might try to trick God. He might say, “God doesn't know about me.” He is only deceiving himself! He is making a big mistake. God continually watches him, he will make it hard for the ignorer. 
Perhaps a person will do bad. In response God will do bad for him. Perhaps a person will do good. In response God will do good for him. Perhaps a person will keep on doing things with his self-centred spirit. In response when he dies God will send him right away forever. Perhaps a person will continually pay attention to the Holy Spirit. In response when he dies God will put him close, he will stay there with God forever. 
Therefore without getting sick-and-tired of it we should continually do good. After doing like that at last God will do really good for us. 
Therefore we should do good to all people, we should do really good for believers.
