John.
Chapter 14.
Jesus said to his men, “Don't be upset! Believe in God, my Father above. Believe in me too. 
My Father has many camps in his country. I truly told you. 
I will go ahead of you to the Father's place. There I will prepare a camp for you. Then I will come back and take you all to that place, to my Father's country, so that you can stay with me forever. We will all gather together in my Father's country. 
I am going to that place. You know the road to that place.” In that way Jesus spoke to them. 
One of them was what's-his-name, Thomas, and he didn't know what Jesus was talking about. He said to Jesus, “Hey boss, where are you going? We don't know about that place, and we don't know the road to that place. How can we follow you to that place?” 
Jesus said to them, “I myself will take people one by one by the hand to the Father. I myself will teach them the true word about the Father. I myself will make them really alive forever. My words are true: no person will go to the Father without me. We two will go to the Father together.”
