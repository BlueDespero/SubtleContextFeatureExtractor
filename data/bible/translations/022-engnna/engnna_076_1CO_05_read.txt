1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
...Some people call themselves Christians, but they are still doing wrong. Maybe they are always looking for illegal sex, maybe greedy, maybe they worship carved representations of spirit beings, maybe they are false criticisers, maybe drunken fellows, maybe thieves. Don't join with people that do those sorts of things, truly don't eat with them.
