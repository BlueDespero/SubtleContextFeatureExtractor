Matthew.
Chapter 10.
People might kill your body. Don't be afraid of them. They can't kill your spirit. Fear only God. He can burn your spirit and body to ashes in the big fire. People cannot do that. Because of that do not be afraid of them. Your Father above knows of everything. He knows when a zebra finch falls to the ground. Truly he knows of you also. He knows the hair on your head. One by one, all of it. Because of that, stay without fear. God just thinks a bit about the zebra finch, he really thinks about you always.
