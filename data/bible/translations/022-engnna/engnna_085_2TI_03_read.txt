2 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
Remember that I have told you, people will be in a truly bad way. People will be selfish, greedy for money, show-offs, boastful, slanderers, ignorers of their parents, won't give back in return, will not be afraid of God; won't feel sorry, they will be violent, they will tell lies about other people, they won't listen when someone tells them to stop, they will be fighters, they will be dislikers of good, deceitfully they will secretly do bad things to people, boldly they will do bad things without thinking what might happen as a result, they will think they are big; they will only please themselves, they won't love God, they will be like Christians but liars, they won't know about the Good Spirit that he makes Christians of good character and makes them avoid evil. Never join with people like those bad ones.
