Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; He judgeth among the gods. 
How long will ye judge unjustly, And accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
Defend the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and needy. 
Deliver the poor and needy: Rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 
They know not, neither will they understand; They walk on in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are out of course. 
I have said, Ye are gods; And all of you are children of the most High. 
But ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes. 
Arise, O God, judge the earth: For thou shalt inherit all nations.
