A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; And there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed. 
A shamefast and faithful woman is a double grace, And her continent mind cannot be valued. 
As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; So is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house. 
As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; So is the beauty of the face in ripe age. 
As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; So are the fair feet with a constant heart. 
My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; And give not thy strength to strangers. 
When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, Sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock. 
So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, Having the confidence of their good descent.
