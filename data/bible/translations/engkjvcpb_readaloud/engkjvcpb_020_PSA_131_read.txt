Psalms.
Chapter 131.
A Song of degrees of David. Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, As a child that is weaned of his mother: My soul is even as a weaned child. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord From henceforth and for ever.
