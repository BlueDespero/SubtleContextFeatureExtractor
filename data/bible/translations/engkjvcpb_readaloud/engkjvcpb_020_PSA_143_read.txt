Psalms.
Chapter 143.
A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Lord, Give ear to my supplications: In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. 
And enter not into judgment with thy servant: For in thy sight shall no man living be justified. 
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground; He hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. 
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate. 
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. 
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: My soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 
Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. 
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee. 
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. 
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: Thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. 
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name’s sake: For thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble. 
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, And destroy all them that afflict my soul: For I am thy servant.
