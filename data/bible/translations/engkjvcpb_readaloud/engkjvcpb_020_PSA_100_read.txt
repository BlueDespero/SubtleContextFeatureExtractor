Psalms.
Chapter 100.
A Psalm of praise. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. 
Serve the Lord with gladness: Come before his presence with singing. 
Know ye that the Lord he is God: It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 
For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; And his truth endureth to all generations.
