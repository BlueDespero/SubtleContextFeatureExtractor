Psalms.
Chapter 86.
A Prayer of David. Bow down thine ear, O Lord, hear me: For I am poor and needy. 
Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: For I cry unto thee daily. 
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; And attend to the voice of my supplications. 
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: For thou wilt answer me. 
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; Neither are there any works like unto thy works. 
All nations whom thou hast made shall come And worship before thee, O Lord; And shall glorify thy name. 
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: Thou art God alone. 
Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name. 
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: And I will glorify thy name for evermore. 
For great is thy mercy toward me: And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
O God, the proud are risen against me, And the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; And have not set thee before them. 
But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, Longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 
O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; Give thy strength unto thy servant, And save the son of thine handmaid. 
Shew me a token for good; That they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: Because thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
