Psalms.
Chapter 140.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: Preserve me from the violent man; 
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; Continually are they gathered together for war. 
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; Adder’s poison is under their lips. Selah. 
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man; Who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the way side; They have set grins for me. Selah. 
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord. 
O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 
Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked: Further not his wicked device; Lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 
As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
Let burning coals fall upon them: Let them be cast into the fire; Into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And the right of the poor. 
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
