Psalms.
Chapter 54.
To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me by thy strength. 
Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. 
For strangers are risen up against me, And oppressors seek after my soul: They have not set God before them. Selah. 
Behold, God is mine helper: The Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: Cut them off in thy truth. 
I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O Lord; for it is good. 
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: And mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
