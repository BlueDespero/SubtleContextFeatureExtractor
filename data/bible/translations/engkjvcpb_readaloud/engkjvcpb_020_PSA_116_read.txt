Psalms.
Chapter 116.
I love the Lord, because he hath heard My voice and my supplications. 
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 
The sorrows of death compassed me, And the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 
Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful. 
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling. 
I will walk before the Lord In the land of the living. 
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 
I said in my haste, All men are liars. 
What shall I render unto the Lord For all his benefits towards me? 
I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows unto the Lord Now in the presence of all his people. 
Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of his saints. 
Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid: Thou hast loosed my bonds. 
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows unto the Lord Now in the presence of all his people, 
In the courts of the Lord’s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.
