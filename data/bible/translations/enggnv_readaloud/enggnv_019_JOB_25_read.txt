Job.
Chapter 25.
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and sayd, 
Power and feare is with him, that maketh peace in his hie places. 
Is there any nomber in his armies? and vpon whom shall not his light arise? 
And howe may a man be iustified with God? or how can he be cleane, that is borne of woman? 
Behold, he wil giue no light to the moone, and the starres are vncleane in his sight. 
How much more man, a worme, euen the sonne of man, which is but a worme?
