And Salomon reigned ouer all kingdomes, from the Riuer vnto the lande of the Philistims, and vnto the border of Egypt, and they brought presents, and serued Salomon all the dayes of his life. 
And Salomons vitailes for one day were thirtie measures of fine floure, and threescore measures of meale: 
Ten fat oxen, and twentie oxen of the pastures, and an hundreth sheepe, beside hartes, and buckes, and bugles, and fat foule. 
For he ruled in all the region on the other side of the Riuer, from Tiphsah euen vnto Azzah, ouer all the Kings on the other side the Riuer: and he had peace round about him on euery side. 
And Iudah and Israel dwelt without feare, euery man vnder his vine, and vnder his fig tree, from Dan, euen to Beer-sheba, all the dayes of Salomon. 
And Salomon had fourtie thousande stalles of horses for his charets, and twelue thousand horsemen. 
And these officers prouided vitaile for king Salomon, and for all that came to King Salomons table, euery man his moneth, and they suffred to lacke nothing. 
Barley also and strawe for the horses and mules brought they vnto the place where the officers were, euery man according to his charge. 
And God gaue Salomon wisdome and vnderstanding exceeding much, and a large heart, euen as the sand that is on the sea shore, 
And Salomons wisdome excelled the wisedome of all the children of the East and all the wisedome of Egypt. 
For he was wiser then any man: yea, then were Ethan the Ezrahite, the Heman, then Chalcol, then Darda the sonnes of Mahol: and he was famous throughout all nations round about. 
And Salomon spake three thousand prouerbs: and his songs were a thousand and fiue. 
And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon, euen vnto the hyssope that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of foules, and of creeping thinges, and of fishes. 
And there came of all people to heare the wisedome of Salomon, from all Kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisedome.
