Psalms.
Chapter 138.
A Psalme of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: euen before the gods will I praise thee. 
I will worship toward thine holy Temple and praise thy Name, because of thy louing kindenesse and for thy trueth: for thou hast magnified thy Name aboue all things by thy word. 
When I called, then thou heardest me, and hast encreased strength in my soule. 
All the Kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they haue heard the wordes of thy mouth. 
And they shall sing of the wayes of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord is great. 
For the Lord is high: yet he beholdeth the lowly, but the proude he knoweth afarre off. 
Though I walke in the middes of trouble, yet wilt thou reuiue me: thou wilt stretch foorth thine hand vpon the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall saue me. 
The Lord will performe his worke toward me: O Lord, thy mercie endureth for euer: forsake not the workes of thine handes.
