Hosea.
Chapter 8.
Set the trumpet to thy mouth: he shall come as an eagle against the House of the Lord, because they haue transgressed my couenant, and trespassed against my Lawe. 
Israel shall crie vnto me, My God, we know thee. 
Israel hath cast off ye thing that is good: the enemie shall pursue him. 
They haue set vp a King, but not by me: they haue made princes, and I knew it not: of their siluer and their gold haue they made them idoles: therefore shall they be destroyed. 
Thy calfe, O Samaria, hath cast thee off: mine anger is kindled against them: howe long will they be without innocencie! 
For it came euen from Israel: the workeman made it, therefore it is not God: but the calfe of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. 
For they haue sowne the winde, and they shall reape the whirlewind: it hath no stalke: the budde shall bring foorth no meale: if so be it bring forth, the strangers shall deuoure it. 
Israel is deuoured, now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessell wherein is no pleasure. 
For they are gone vp to Asshur: they are as a wilde asse alone by himselfe: Ephraim hath hired louers. 
Yet though they haue hired among the nations, nowe will I gather them, and they shall sorowe a litle, for the burden of the King and the princes. 
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sinne, his altars shalbe to sinne. 
I haue written to them the great things of my Lawe: but they were counted as a strange thing. 
They sacrifice flesh for ye sacrifices of mine offerings, and eate it: but the Lord accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquitie, and visite their sinnes: they shall returne to Egypt. 
For Israel hath forgotten his maker, and buildeth Temples, and Iudah hath increased strong cities: but I will sende a fire vpon his cities, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof.
