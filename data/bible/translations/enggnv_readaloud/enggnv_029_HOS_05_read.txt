Hosea.
Chapter 5.
O ye Priestes, heare this, and hearken ye, O house of Israel, and giue ye eare, O house of the King: for iudgement is towarde you, because you haue bene a snare on Mizpah, and a net spred vpon Tabor. 
Yet they were profounde, to decline to slaughter, though I haue bene a rebuker of them all. 
I knowe Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for nowe, O Ephraim thou art become an harlot, and Israel is defiled. 
They will not giue their mindes to turne vnto their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the middes of them, and they haue not knowen the Lord. 
And the pride of Israel doth testifie to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquitie: Iudah also shall fall with them. 
They shall goe with their sheepe, and with their bullockes to seeke the Lord: but they shall not finde him: for he hath withdrawne himselfe from them. 
They haue transgressed against the Lord: for they haue begotte strange children: now shall a moneth deuoure them with their portions. 
Blowe ye the trumpet in Gibeah, and the shaume in Ramah: crie out at Beth-auen, after thee, O Beniamin. 
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel haue I caused to knowe the trueth. 
The princes of Iudah were like them that remoue the bounde: therefore will I powre out my wrath vpon them like water. 
Ephraim is oppressed, and broken in iudgement, because he willingly walked after the commandement. 
Therefore wil I be vnto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Iudah as a rottennesse. 
When Ephraim sawe his sickenes, and Iudah his wound, then went Ephraim vnto Asshur, and sent vnto King Iareb: yet coulde hee not heale you, nor cure you of your wound. 
For I will be vnto Ephraim as a lyon, and as a lyons whelpe to the house of Iudah: I, euen I will spoyle, and goe away: I will take away, and none shall rescue it. 
I will go, and returne to my place, til they acknowledge their fault, and seeke me: in their affliction they will seeke me diligently.
