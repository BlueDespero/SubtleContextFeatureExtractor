Psalms.
Chapter 13.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Howe long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? howe long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
How long shall I take counsell within my selfe, hauing wearinesse dayly in mine heart? how long shall mine enemie be exalted aboue me? 
Beholde, and heare mee, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleepe not in death: 
Lest mine enemie say, I haue preuailed against him: and they that afflict me, reioyce when I slide. 
But I trust in thy mercie: mine heart shall reioyce in thy saluation: I will sing to the Lord, because he hath delt louingly with me.
