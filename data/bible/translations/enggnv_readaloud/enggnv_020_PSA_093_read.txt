Psalms.
Chapter 93.
The Lord reigneth, and is clothed with maiestie: the Lord is clothed, and girded with power: the world also shall be established, that it cannot be mooued. 
Thy throne is established of olde: thou art from euerlasting. 
The floodes haue lifted vp, O Lord: the floodes haue lifted vp their voyce: the floods lift vp their waues. 
The waues of ye sea are marueilous through the noyse of many waters, yet the Lord on High is more mightie. 
Thy testimonies are very sure: holinesse becommeth thine House, O Lord, for euer.
