Psalms.
Chapter 96.
Sing vnto the Lord a newe song: sing vnto the Lord, all the earth. 
Sing vnto the Lord, and prayse his Name: declare his saluation from day to day. 
Declare his glory among all nations, and his wonders among all people. 
For the Lord is great and much to be praysed: he is to be feared aboue all gods. 
For all the gods of the people are idoles: but the Lord made the heauens. 
Strength and glory are before him: power and beautie are in his Sanctuarie. 
Giue vnto the Lord, ye families of the people: giue vnto the Lord glory and power. 
Giue vnto the Lord the glory of his Name: bring an offering, and enter into his courtes. 
Worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuarie: tremble before him all the earth. 
Say among the nations, The Lord reigneth: surely the world shalbe stable, and not moue, and he shall iudge the people in righteousnesse. 
Let the heauens reioyce, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roare, and all that therein is. 
Let the field be ioyfull, and all that is in it: let all the trees of the wood then reioyce 
Before the Lord: for he commeth, for he cometh to iudge the earth: he wil iudge the world with righteousnes, and the people in his trueth.
