1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
It is heard certainely that there is fornication among you: and such fornication as is not once named among the Gentiles, that one should haue his fathers wife. 
And ye are puffed vp and haue not rather sorowed, that he which hath done this deede, might be put from among you. 
For I verely as absent in bodie, but present in spirit, haue determined already as though I were present, that he that hath thus done this thing, 
When ye are gathered together, and my spirit, in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that such one, I say, by the power of our Lord Iesus Christ, 
Be deliuered vnto Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus. 
Your reioycing is not good: knowe ye not that a litle leauen, leaueneth ye whole lumpe? 
Purge out therefore the olde leauen, that ye may be a newe lumpe, as ye are vnleauened: for Christ our Passeouer is sacrificed for vs. 
Therefore let vs keepe the feast, not with olde leauen, neither in the leauen of maliciousnes and wickednesse: but with the vnleauened bread of synceritie and trueth. 
I wrote vnto you in an Epistle, that ye should not companie together with fornicatours, 
And not altogether with the fornicatours of this world, or with the couetous, or with extortioners, or with idolaters: for then ye must goe out of the world. 
But nowe I haue written vnto you, that ye companie not together: if any that is called a brother, be a fornicatour, or couetous, or an idolater, or a rayler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such one eate not. 
For what haue I to doe, to iudge them also which are without? doe ye not iudge them that are within? 
But God iudgeth them that are without. Put away therefore from among your selues that wicked man.
