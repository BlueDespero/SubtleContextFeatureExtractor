Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye seruants of the Lord, prayse the Name of the Lord. 
Blessed be the Name of the Lord from hencefoorth and for euer. 
The Lordes Name is praysed from the rising of ye sunne, vnto ye going downe of the same. 
The Lord is high aboue all nations, and his glorie aboue the heauens. 
Who is like vnto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling on high! 
Who abaseth himselfe to beholde things in the heauen and in the earth! 
He raiseth the needie out of the dust, and lifteth vp the poore out of the dung, 
That he may set him with the princes, euen with the princes of his people. 
He maketh the barren woman to dwell with a familie, and a ioyfull mother of children. Prayse ye the Lord.
