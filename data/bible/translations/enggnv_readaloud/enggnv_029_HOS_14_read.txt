Hosea.
Chapter 14.
Samaria shalbe desolate: for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sworde: their infants shalbe dashed in pieces, and their women with childe shalbe ript. 
O Israel, returne vnto the Lord thy God: for thou hast fallen by thine iniquitie. 
Take vnto you words, and turne to the Lord, and say vnto him, Take away all iniquitie, and receiue vs graciously: so wil we render the calues of our lippes. 
Asshur shall not saue vs, neither wil we ride vpon horses, neither will we say any more to the worke of our handes, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherlesse findeth mercie. 
I wil heale their rebellion: I wil loue them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 
I will be as the dewe vnto Israel: he shall grow as the lilie and fasten his rootes, as the trees of Lebanon. 
His branches shall spread, and his beautie shalbe as the oliue tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 
They that dwel vnder his shadow, shall returne: they shall reuiue as the corne, and florish as the vine: the sent thereof shalbe as the wine of Lebanon. 
Ephraim shall say, What haue I to doe any more with idoles? I haue heard him, and looked vpon him: I am like a greene firre tree: vpon me is thy fruite founde. 
Who is wise, and he shall vnderstande these things? and prudent, and he shall knowe them? for the wayes of the Lord are righteous, and the iust shall walke in them: but the wicked shall fall therein.
