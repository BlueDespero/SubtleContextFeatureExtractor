Job.
Chapter 35.
Elihu spake moreouer, and said, 
Thinkest thou this right, that thou hast said, I am more righteous then God? 
For thou hast said, What profiteth it thee and what auaileth it me, to purge me from my sinne? 
Therefore will I answere thee, and thy companions with thee. 
Looke vnto the heauen, and see and behold the cloudes which are hyer then thou. 
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him, yea, when thy sinnes be many, what doest thou vnto him? 
If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him? or what receiueth he at thine hand? 
Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousnes may profite ye sonne of man. 
They cause many that are oppressed, to crye, which crye out for ye violence of the mightie. 
But none saieth, Where is God that made me, which giueth songs in the nyght? 
Which teacheth vs more then the beastes of the earth, and giueth vs more wisdome then the foules of the heauen. 
Then they crye because of the violence of the wicked, but he answereth not. 
Surely God will not heare vanitie, neyther will the Almightie regard it. 
Although thou sayest to God, Thou wilt not regard it, yet iudgement is before him: trust thou in him. 
But nowe because his anger hath not visited, nor called to count the euill with great extremitie, 
Therfore Iob openeth his mouth in vaine, and multiplieth wordes without knowledge.
