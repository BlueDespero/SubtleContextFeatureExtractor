Chapter 6.
Then the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Nowe shalt thou see, what I will doe vnto Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them goe, and euen be constrained to driue them out of his land. 
Moreouer God spake vnto Moses, and sayd vnto him, I am the Lord, 
And I appeared vnto Abraham, to Izhak, and to Iaakob by the Name of Almightie God: but by my Name Iehouah was I not knowen vnto the. 
Furthermore as I made my couenant with them to giue them ye land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers: 
So I haue also hearde the groning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keepe in bondage, and haue remembred my couenant. 
Wherefore say thou vnto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from the burdens of the Egyptians, and will deliuer you out of their bondage, and will redeeme you in a stretched out arme, and in great iudgements. 
Also I will take you for my people, and will be your God: then ye shall knowe that I the Lord your God bring you out from the burdens of the Egyptians. 
And I will bring you into the land which I sware that I woulde giue to Abraham, to Izhak, and to Iaakob, and I will giue it vnto you for a possession: I am the Lord. 
So Moses told the children of Israel thus: but they hearkened not vnto Moses, for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage. 
Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying, 
Go speak to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel goe out of his land. 
But Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Beholde, the children of Israel hearken not vnto me, howe then shall Pharaoh heare mee, which am of vncircumcised lippes? 
Then the Lord spake vnto Moses and vnto Aaron, and charged them to goe to the children of Israel and to Pharaoh King of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the lande of Egypt.

These are Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, according to their armies. 
These are that Moses and Aaron, which spake to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that they might bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
And at that time when the Lord spake vnto Moses in the land of Egypt, 
When the Lord, I say, spake vnto Moses, saying, I am the Lord, speake thou vnto Pharaoh the King of Egypt all that I say vnto thee, 
Then Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of vncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heare me?
