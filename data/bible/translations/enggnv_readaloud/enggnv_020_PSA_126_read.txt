Psalms.
Chapter 126.
A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. When ye Lord brought againe the captiuitie of Zion, we were like them that dreame. 
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioye: then sayd they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. 
The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce. 
O Lord, bring againe our captiuitie, as the riuers in the South. 
They that sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy. 
They went weeping and caried precious seede: but they shall returne with ioye and bring their sheaues.
