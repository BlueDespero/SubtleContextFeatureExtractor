Psalms.
Chapter 42.
To him that excelleth. A Psalme to give instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah. As the harte brayeth for the riuers of water, so panteth my soule after thee, O God. 
My soule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuing God: when shall I come and appeare before the presence of God? 
My teares haue bin my meate day and night, while they dayly say vnto me, Where is thy God? 
When I remembred these things, I powred out my very heart, because I had gone with the multitude, and ledde them into the House of God with the voyce of singing, and prayse, as a multitude that keepeth a feast. 
Why art thou cast downe, my soule, and vnquiet within me? waite on God: for I will yet giue him thankes for the helpe of his presence. 
My God, my soule is cast downe within me, because I remember thee, from the land of Iorden, and Hermonim, and from the mount Mizar. 
One deepe calleth another deepe by the noyse of thy water spoutes: all thy waues and thy floods are gone ouer me. 
The Lord will graunt his louing kindenesse in the day, and in the night shall I sing of him, euen a prayer vnto the God of my life. 
I wil say vnto God, which is my rocke, Why hast thou forgotten mee? why goe I mourning, when the enemie oppresseth me? 
My bones are cut asunder, while mine enemies reproch me, saying dayly vnto me, Where is thy God? 
Why art thou cast downe, my soule? and why art thou disquieted within mee? waite on God: for I wil yet giue him thankes: he is my present helpe, and my God.
