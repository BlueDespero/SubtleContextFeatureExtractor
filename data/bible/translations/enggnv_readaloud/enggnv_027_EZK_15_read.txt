Ezekiel.
Chapter 15.
And thee word of the Lord came vnto me, saying, 
Sonne of man, what commeth of the vine tree aboue all other trees? and of the vine braunch, which is among the trees of ye forest? 
Shall wood bee taken thereof to doe any worke? or wil men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
Behold, it is cast in the fire to be consumed: the fire consumeth both the endes of it, and the middes of it is burnt. Is it meete for any worke? 
Behold, when it was whole, it was meete for no worke: how much lesse shall it bee meete for any worke, when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burnt? 
Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, As the vine tree, that is among the trees of the forest, which I haue giuen to the fire to be consumed, so will I giue the inhabitants of Ierusalem. 
And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall consume them: and ye shall know, that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them, 
And when I make the lande waste, because they haue greatly offended, saith the Lord God.
