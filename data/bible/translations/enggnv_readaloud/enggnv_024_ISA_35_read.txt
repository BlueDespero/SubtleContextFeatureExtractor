Isaiah.
Chapter 35.
The desert and the wildernes shall reioyce: and the waste ground shalbe glad and florish as the rose. 
It shall florish abundantly and shall greatly reioyce also and ioye: the glory of Lebanon shalbe giuen vnto it: the beautie of Carmel, and of Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellencie of our God. 
Strengthen the weake handes, and comfort the feeble knees. 
Say vnto them that are fearefull, Bee you strong, feare not: beholde, your God commeth with vengeance: euen God with a recompense, he will come and saue you. 
Then shall the eyes of the blinde be lightened, and the eares of the deafe be opened. 
Then shall ye lame man leape as an hart, and the dumme mans tongue shall sing: for in the wildernes shall waters breake out, and riuers in ye desert. 
And the dry ground shalbe as a poole, and the thirstie (as springs of water in the habitation of dragons: where they lay) shall be a place for reedes and rushes. 
And there shalbe a path and a way, and the way shalbe called holy: the polluted shall not passe by it: for he shalbe with them, and walke in the way, and the fooles shall not erre. 
There shall be no lyon, nor noysome beastes shall ascend by it, neither shall they be found there, that the redeemed may walke. 
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall returne and come to Zion with prayse: and euerlasting ioy shall bee vpon their heads: they shall obteine ioye and gladnesse, and sorow and mourning shall flee away.
