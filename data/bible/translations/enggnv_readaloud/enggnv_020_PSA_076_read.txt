Psalms.
Chapter 76.
To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme or song committed to Asaph. God is knowen in Iudah: his Name is great in Israel. 
For in Shalem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Zion. 
There brake he the arrowes of the bowe, the shielde and the sword and the battell. Selah. 
Thou art more bright and puissant, then the mountaines of pray. 
The stout hearted are spoyled: they haue slept their sleepe, and all the men of strength haue not found their hands. 
At thy rebuke, O God of Iaakob, both the chariot and horse are cast a sleepe. 
Thou, euen thou art to be feared: and who shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angrie! 
Thou didest cause thy iudgement to bee heard from heauen: therefore the earth feared and was still, 
When thou, O God, arose to iudgement, to helpe all the meeke of the earth. Selah. 
Surely the rage of man shall turne to thy praise: the remnant of the rage shalt thou restrayne. 
Vowe and performe vnto the Lord your God, all ye that be rounde about him: let them bring presents vnto him that ought to be feared. 
He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the Kings of the earth.
