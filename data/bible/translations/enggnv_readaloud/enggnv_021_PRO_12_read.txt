Proverbs.
Chapter 12.
He that loueth instruction, loueth knowledge: but he that hateth correction, is a foole. 
A good man getteth fauour of the Lord: but the man of wicked immaginations will hee condemne. 
A man cannot be established by wickednesse: but the roote of the righteous shall not be mooued. 
A vertuous woman is the crowne of her husband: but she that maketh him ashamed, is as corruption in his bones. 
The thoughtes of the iust are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceitfull. 
The talking of the wicked is to lye in waite for blood: but the mouth of the righteous will deliuer them. 
God ouerthroweth the wicked, and they are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. 
A man shall be commended for his wisedome: but the froward of heart shalbe despised. 
He that is despised, and is his owne seruant, is better then he that boasteth himselfe and lacketh bread. 
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the mercies of the wicked are cruell. 
He that tilleth his lande, shalbe satisfied with bread: but he that followeth the idle, is destitute of vnderstanding. 
The wicked desireth the net of euils: but the roote of the righteous giueth fruite. 
The euill man is snared by the wickednesse of his lips, but the iust shall come out of aduersitie. 
A man shalbe satiate with good things by the fruite of his mouth, and the recompence of a mans hands shall God giue vnto him. 
The way of a foole is right in his owne eyes: but he that heareth counsell, is wise. 
A foole in a day shall be knowen by his anger: but he that couereth shame, is wise. 
He that speaketh trueth, will shewe righteousnes: but a false witnes vseth deceite. 
There is that speaketh wordes like the prickings of a sworde: but the tongue of wise men is health. 
The lip of trueth shall be stable for euer: but a lying tongue varieth incontinently. 
Deceite is in the heart of them that imagine euill: but to the counsellers of peace shall be ioye. 
There shall none iniquitie come to the iust: but the wicked are full of euill. 
The lying lips are an abomination to the Lord: but they that deale truely are his delite. 
A wise man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fooles publisheth foolishnes. 
The hand of the diligent shall beare rule: but the idle shalbe vnder tribute. 
Heauines in the heart of man doeth bring it downe: but a good worde reioyceth it. 
The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: but the way of the wicked will deceiue them. 
The deceitfull man rosteth not, that hee tooke in hunting: but the riches of the diligent man are precious. 
Life is in the way of righteousnesse, and in that path way there is no death.
