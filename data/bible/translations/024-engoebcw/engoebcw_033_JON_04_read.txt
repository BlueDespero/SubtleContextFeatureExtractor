Jonah.
Chapter 4.
But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he became angry. 
He prayed to the Lord and said, “Ah, Lord, wasn't this what I said when I was still in my own country? That was why I fled at once to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, patient, and loving and ready to forgive. 
Therefore, Lord, I beg you, take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live!” 
But the Lord said, “Are you doing right in being angry?” 
Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down on the east side, and there made a hut for himself and sat under it, waiting to see what would become of the city. 
And the Lord arranged for a bush to grow up over Jonah as a shade for his head to make him comfortable. The bush gave Jonah great pleasure; 
but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm which attacked the bush, so that it wilted. 
And when the sun rose, God arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah's head, so that he was faint and begged that he might die, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.” 
But God said to Jonah, “Are you doing right in being angry about the bush?” He replied, “I have every right to be as angry as I could possibly be!” 
The Lord said, “You care about a bush which has cost you no trouble and which you have not made grow, which came up in a night and wilted in a night. 
Should I not care for the great city Nineveh, in which there are one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left; and many cattle too?”
