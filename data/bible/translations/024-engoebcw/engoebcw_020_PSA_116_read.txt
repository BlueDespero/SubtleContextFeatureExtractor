Psalms.
Chapter 116.
I love the Lord, for he hears my voice, my pleas for mercy. 
For he has inclined his ear to me: I will call upon him as long as I live. 
About me were snares of death, the anguish of Sheol was upon me: distress and sorrow were mine. 
Then I called on the name of the Lord: “I beseech you, O Lord, deliver me.” 
Gracious and just is the Lord, compassionate is our God. 
The Lord preserves the simple; when I was drooping, he saved me. 
Be at peace, my heart, once more, for the Lord has been good to you. 
You have rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. 
Before the Lord I will walk in the land of the living. 
I held fast my faith, though I said, “Ah me! I am sore afflicted,” 
though in my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.” 
What shall I render the Lord for all his bounty to me? 
I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people. 
Grave in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his loyal and loved ones. 
Ah, Lord! I am your servant, your servant, child of your handmaid. You have loosened my bonds. 
I will offer to you a thank-offering, and call on the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people, 
in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
