1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone, 
especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit. 
This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Saviour, 
whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth. 
There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity — the human, Christ Jesus, 
who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all. This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves; 
and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) — a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth. 
My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy. 
I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing, 
but — as is proper for women who profess to be religious — with good actions. 
They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference. 
I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss. 
Adam was formed first, not Eve. 
And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin. 
But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty.
