Psalms.
Chapter 124.
A song of ascents. Of David. “Had it not been the Lord who was for us” let Israel say 
“Had it not been the Lord who was for us when enemies rose against us, 
then alive they'd have swallowed us up, when their anger was kindled against us. 
Then the waters would've swept us away, and the torrent passed over us clean: 
then most sure would've passed over us clean the wild seething waters.” 
Blest be the Lord who has given us not to be torn by their teeth. 
We are like a bird just escaped from the snare of the fowler. The snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
Our help is the name of the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth.
