Psalms.
Chapter 55.
For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. Listen, God, to my prayer. Don't hide yourself from my pleading. 
Hear me, and answer; for bitter is my lament. 
I am wild with the noise of the foe, with the clamour of the ungodly; for they hurl disaster upon me, and attack me with fury. 
My heart shudders within me, terrors of deaths press on me, 
fear and trembling attack me, and horror wraps me round. 
O for the wings of a dove: I would fly away and rest. 
I would wander far away, find refuge in the wilderness. Selah 
I would find myself a shelter from raging wind and tempest. 
Confuse them, Lord, upset their plans; for I see violence and strife in the city. 
By day and by night they make their rounds on the city walls, while within is crime and trouble, 
within is ruin. Her market-place is never free of deceit and tyranny. 
The taunts were not those of a foe that I could have borne; the disdain was not that of an enemy I could have shunned them: 
but it was you, my equal, my dear and familiar friend. 
We used to be so close, together we walked in God's house with the crowd. 
May death suddenly take them, may they go down to Sheol alive, for evil lives in their homes and their hearts. 
But I will call on God, the Lord will save me. 
Evening and morning and noon I lament and moan. He will hear my voice; 
though I am attacked by many he will rescue me, unharmed from the war. 
God, who sits on his ancient throne will hear and will humble them, for they never change, they never fear God. Selah 
My friend turned against me, betrayed his word. 
His mouth was smoother than butter, but war filled his heart. His words were softer than oil, but sharper than swords. 
Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you. He will never let the righteous be shaken. 
But you, God, will hurl them down to the deepest pit. Bloody and treacherous people will not live out half their days; but I will trust you.
