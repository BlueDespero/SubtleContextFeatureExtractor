Zechariah.
Chapter 3.
Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the messenger of the Lord and the Adversary standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
And the messenger of the Lord said to the Adversary, “May the Lord rebuke you, Adversary! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?” 
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger. 
The messenger said to those who stood before him, “Take off his filthy garments.” Then to Joshua he said, “I have taken your guilt from you and I will clothe you in priestly robes.” 
And he ordered: “Set a clean turban upon his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. The messenger of the Lord was standing by. 
And the messenger of the Lord testified to Joshua: 
The Lord of hosts says: “If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will give you a place of access amongst these that stand by. 
Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch. 
On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven facets. I will engrave it,” says the Lord of hosts, “and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day. 
On that day,” says the Lord of hosts, “you will each invite your neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.”
