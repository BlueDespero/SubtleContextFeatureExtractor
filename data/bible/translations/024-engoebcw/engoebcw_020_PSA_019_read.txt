Psalms.
Chapter 19.
For the leader. A psalm of David. The heavens declare God's glory, the sky tells what his hands have done. 
Day tells it to day, night reveals it to night, 
without speaking, without words; without the sound of voices. 
But through all the world their voice carries their words to the ends of the earth. He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky, 
it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber, it joyfully runs its course like a hero. 
From one end of the heavens it rises, and around it runs to the other, and nothing hides from its heat. 
The law of the Lord is perfect, renewing life. The decrees of the Lord are trusty, making the simple wise. 
The behests of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The command of the Lord is pure, giving light to the eyes. 
The fear of the Lord is clean, it endures forever. The Lord's judgements are true and right altogether. 
More precious are they than gold — than fine gold in plenty, and sweeter they are than honey, that drops from the comb. 
By them is your servant warned; who keeps them has rich reward. 
Who can know their flaws? Absolve me from those I know not. 
Keep your servant from wilful sins — from falling under their sway: then blameless and clear will I be from great offence. 
May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you, Lord, my rock and redeemer.
