Psalms.
Chapter 93.
The Lord has taken his seat on the throne, clothed with majesty, armed with might. Now the world stands firm, to be shaken no more, 
firm stands your throne from all eternity. You are from everlasting. 
The floods, O Lord, have lifted, the floods have lifted their voice, the floods lift up their roar. 
But more grand than the great roaring waters, more grand than the ocean waves, grand on the height stands the Lord. 
What you have ordained is most sure; most sure shall your house stand inviolate, O Lord, for ever and ever.
