Psalms.
Chapter 125.
A song of ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, that cannot be moved, but abides forever. 
Round Jerusalem are the mountains, and the Lord is round his people from now and for evermore. 
For he will not suffer the sceptre of wrong to rest on the land allotted to the righteous; else the righteous might put forth their own hand to evil. 
Do good, O Lord, to the good, and to the true-hearted. 
But those who swerve into crooked ways will the Lord lead away with the workers of evil. Peace be upon Israel.
