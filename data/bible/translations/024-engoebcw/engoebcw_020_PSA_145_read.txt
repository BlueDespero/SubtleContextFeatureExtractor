Psalms.
Chapter 145.
A song of praise. Of David. I will exalt you, my God, O king: I will praise your name for ever and ever. 
I will bless you every day: I will praise your name for ever and ever. 
Great is the Lord and worthy all praise, his greatness is unsearchable. 
One age to another shall praise your deeds, declaring the mighty things you have done. 
Of your glorious majesty they shall tell, and I will muse of your many wonders. 
Of the might of your terrible acts they shall speak, and the tale of your great deeds I will tell. 
The fame of your abundant goodness and righteousness they shall pour forth in song. 
The Lord is full of grace and pity, patient and rich in loving-kindness. 
The Lord is good to all the world, and his pity is over all things that he made. 
All your works give you thanks, O Lord, and you are blessed of those who love you. 
They shall speak of your glorious kingdom, and of your might shall they discourse, 
making known to all his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
Yours is a kingdom that lives through all ages: through all generations extends your dominion. The Lord is faithful in all that he promises, gracious is he in all that he does. 
The Lord upholds all who fall; he lifts up all who are bowed down. 
The eyes of all look in hope to you, and you give them their food in due season. 
You yourself open your hand, and fill with your favour all things that live. 
The Lord is righteous in all his ways, gracious is he in all that he does. 
The Lord is near to all who call him, to all who call upon him in truth. 
He will fulfil the desires of those who fear him; he will hear their cry for help and save them. 
The Lord is the keeper of all who love him, but all the wicked will he destroy. 
My mouth will utter the praise of the Lord, and all life will bless his holy name for ever and ever.
