Psalms.
Chapter 62.
For the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David. I wait alone in silence for God; From him comes my help. 
Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely. 
How long will you, all of you, batter a man, as one might a leaning wall? 
From his height they are planning to topple him. They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth, but inwardly they curse. Selah 
I wait alone in silence for God; for from him comes my hope. 
Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat, I shall not be shaken too sorely. 
On God rests my honour and safety, in God is my strong rock, my refuge. 
Trust in him, all you people assembled, pour out your heart in his presence; God is a refuge for us. Selah 
The lowly are nought but a breath, the lofty are but an illusion: in the balances up they go, they are lighter than breath altogether. 
Trust not in gain of extortion, set no vain hopes in robbery. As for wealth, if it bears fruit, set not your heart upon it. 
One thing God has uttered, two things there are which I heard that power belongs to God, 
and to you, too, O Lord, belongs kindness; for you requite each person according to what they have done.
