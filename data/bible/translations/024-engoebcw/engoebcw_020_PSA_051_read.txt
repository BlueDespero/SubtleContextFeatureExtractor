Psalms.
Chapter 51.
For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba. In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me, in your own great pity blot out my transgressions. 
Wash me clean of my guilt, make me pure of my sin. 
For well I know my transgressions, my sin is ever before me. 
Against you, only you, have I sinned, and done that which is wrong in your sight: you therefore are just when you speak, and clear when you utter judgement. 
See! In guilt was I brought to the birth, and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
It's the innermost truth you desire, give me therefore true wisdom of heart. 
Purge me clean with hyssop, wash me whiter than snow. 
Fill me with joy and gladness, let the bones you have broken rejoice. 
Hide your face from my sins, and blot out my guilt altogether. 
Create me a clean heart, O God, put a new steadfast spirit within me. 
Cast me not forth from your presence, withdraw not your holy spirit. 
Give me back the joy of your help, with a willing spirit sustain me. 
I will teach your ways to transgressors, and sinners shall turn to you. 
Save me from blood, O God, and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness. 
Open my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall declare your praise. 
For in sacrifice you have no pleasure, in gifts of burnt-offering no delight. 
The sacrifice pleasing to God is a spirit that is broken; a heart that is crushed, O God, you will not despise. 
Do good in your pleasure to Zion, build the walls of Jerusalem. 
Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice, then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.
