John.
Chapter 15.
...Jesus said to his men, you cannot do anything without me. Perhaps someone might leave me by going in a different way, he will become like a dry branch. Branches like those, people gather in a heap to burn. Stay joined to me and do according to my word carefully, as a result of doing that you can ask God for anything, whatever it is, he will do that very thing. My people are good, they continually do good. When people see it truly they will praise my Father.
