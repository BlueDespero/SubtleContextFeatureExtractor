Mark.
Chapter 12.
One day Jesus was sitting in the big house, God's house, the Temple. A big money box was there. People were bringing money for God, they were putting it in that box. Jesus was sitting near that money box. They were putting in money, he was watching them. Some people with a lot of money put in a big lot of money. 
After that a poor bereaved woman came. Her husband had earlier died. She put in two little coins for God. That was valuable. After giving those two that woman had no more money. 
Jesus said to his men, “Do you see that poor woman? She has very little money. She put in all of it for God. Now she has no money for food or anything. This word I am telling you is true, those others have a lot of money. From a lot they gave just some for God. They put in a little for God. That poor bereaved woman put in much. She gave everything to God.
