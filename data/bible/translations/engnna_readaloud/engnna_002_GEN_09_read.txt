Genesis.
Chapter 9.
God spoke kindly to Noah and his children. “You will have many children. They will be everywhere. 
You will be boss for all the animals. They will be afraid of you. 
Now I am giving them all to you to eat, the fish and animals and birds. Previously you only used to eat vegetable food. Now you can also eat meat. 
You must not eat blood. When you eat meat, leave the blood without eating it. 
You should not hit/kill a person. Be good to people. I made people like me. Because of that don't kill a person. If anyone hits/kills a person you(pl) will kill him in return.” 
God spoke another word to Noah and his children, “I am giving you (pl) this word, for you and yours, and for all the animals and for everything on the ground. 
Because of this word of mine I will not again hit/kill people and animals and other things by means of a flood. 
It will stay like this from now on. I am giving you this word now. 
I am putting that rainbow of mine in the clouds. 
Whenever I send you clouds that have rain, I will put my rainbow in the clouds. Truly I will see that. When I see it, truly I will remember this word I am putting down for you today. That rainbow is a reminder for this word. This firm word of mine is for you (pl) and the animals, for everything on the ground. I will not kill everything with a flood. It will stay (the same) from now on.” 
Those children of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth had children. From them all of us came. NOTE: Chapter 10 has been omitted at this stage, because it would merely confuse and distract struggling readers. 
After the big flood Noah lived a long time, 350 years. 
He became 950 years old. After that he died.
