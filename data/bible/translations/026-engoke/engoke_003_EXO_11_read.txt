Exodus.
Chapter 11.
But the Lord said to Mosheh, Yet one plague will I bring upon Pharoh and upon Mizraim; after which he will send you hence. When sending away he thoroughly driving will drive you from hence. 
Speak now before the people of Israel that a man shall require of his companion, and a woman of her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. 
And the Lord gave the people favour in the eyes of the Mizraee; also the man Mosheh was very great in the land of Mizraim, in the eyes of the servants of Pharoh and in the eyes of the people. 
And Mosheh said, Thus saith the Lord, At the dividing of the night I will be revealed in the midst of Mizraim, 
And all the firstborn in the land of Mizraim shall die; from the firstborn of Pharoh who would sit upon the throne of his kingdom, unto the firstborn of the womanservant who is behind the mills, and all the firstborn of cattle. 
And there shall be a great cry in all the land of Mizraim, the like of which hath not been, nor will be the like of it again. 
But anyone of the sons of Israel no dog will hurt even with his tongue by barking, from man and to beast, so that you shall know that the Lord hath distinguished between the Mizraee and Israel. 
And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and beseech of me, saying, Go forth, thou and all thy people who are with thee: and after that I will go forth. And he went out from Pharoh with vehement anger. 
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Pharoh will not hearken to you; therefore will I multiply My wonders in the land of Mizraim. 
And Mosheh and Aharon wrought all these wonders before Pharoh; but the Lord hardened Pharoh’s heart, that he would not send the children of Israel from his land.
