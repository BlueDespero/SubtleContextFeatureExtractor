Deuteronomy.
Chapter 25.
If there be (a case for) judgment between men, let them bring it to the, judges, that they may adjudicate; and they shall justify the innocent, and condemn the guilty. 
And if the guilty be condemned to be scourged, the judge shall cause him to lie down, and have him scourged before him (with stripes), in number according to the measure of his guilt. 
Forty (times) he may smite him, not more, lest he should go on to smite him above these with many stripes, and thy brother be made vile in thy eyes. 
Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox while he treadeth out (the corn). 
If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, having no son, the wife of the deceased shall not marry another man without; her husband’s brother shall go to her, and take her to him to wife, and marry her for his brother. 
And the first-born that she beareth shall keep up the name of his deceased brother, that his name be not blotted out from Israel. 
But should the man be unwilling to take the wife of his brother, his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate of the house of judgment, and say before the elders, My husband’s brother refuseth to keep up a name to his brother in Israel; he is not willing to marry me. 
Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak with him; and if he rise up and say, It is not my pleasure to take her; 
Then shall his brother’s wife approach him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and answer, and say, Thus let it be done to the man who will not build up the house of his brother. 
And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of the loosed shoe. 
If men strive together, a man and his brother, and the wife of one (of them) come nigh to save her husband from the hand of him who smiteth him, and put forth her hand and seize the place of his shame, 
then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity on her. 
Thou shalt not have in thy bag weight and weight, great and small. 
Thou shalt not have in thy house measure and measure, great and small: 
Perfect weights and true shalt thou have, perfect measures and true shalt thou have, that thy days may be prolonged upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: 
For everyone who doeth these things, everyone who acteth falsely, is an abomination before the Lord thy God. 
Remember what Amalek did to thee in the way, when thou camest up out of Mizraim; 
How he overtook thee in the way, and slew of thee all who were following behind thee when thou wast faint and weary; and he was not afraid before the Lord. 
Therefore when the Lord thy God shall have given thee rest from all thy enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for a possession to inherit, thou shalt blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens: thou shalt not be forgetful.
