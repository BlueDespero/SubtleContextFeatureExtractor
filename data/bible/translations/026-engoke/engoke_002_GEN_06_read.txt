Genesis.
Chapter 6.
And it was when the sons of men had begun to multiply upon the earth, and daughters were born to them, 
that the sons of the mighty saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful, and took to them wives of all whom they pleased. 
And the Lord said, This evil generation shall not stand before me forever, because they are flesh, and their works are evil. A term (or length) will I give them, an hundred and twenty years, if they may be converted. 
Giants were in the earth in those days; and also when, after that the sons of the mighty had gone in unto the daughters of men, there were born from them giants who from of old were men of name. 
And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man had multiplied in the earth, and that every formation (or image) of the thought of his heart was only evil every day. 
And it repented the Lord in His Word that He had made men upon the earth. 
And He said, (in His Word,) that He would break their strength according to His pleasure. And the Lord said, Man whom I have made will I blot out I from the face of the earth; from man to the beast, to the reptile, and to the fowls of heaven; because it repenteth Me in My Word that I have made them. 
But Noach found mercy before the Lord. 
These are the memorials of Noach. Noach was a man righteous and perfect in his generation; in the fear of the Lord walked Noach. 
And Noach begat three sons, Shem, Cham, and Yapeth. 
And the earth was corrupted before the Lord, and the earth was filled with violences. 
And the Lord saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, because all flesh had corrupted, each one, his way upon the earth. 
And the Lord said to Noach, The end of all flesh cometh before Me, because the earth is filled with violences from the face of their wicked works; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
Make thee an ark with the wood of cedar; dwellings shalt thou make in the ark, and overlay it within and without with pitch. 
And thus shalt thou make it: three hundred cubits shall be the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height. 
A light shalt thou make to the ark, and at a cubit shalt thou complete it above, and the door of the ark thou shalt place in its side. Lower dwellings, second and third, shalt thou make in it. 
And I, behold, I do bring the deluge of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under the heavens. Everything that is on the earth shall die. 
And I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee. 
And of all that liveth of all flesh two and two of all that enter into the ark to abide with thee, male and female shall they be. 
Of fowl according to its kind, and of cattle according to her kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of all shall enter with thee to abide. 
And thou, take with thee of all food which is eaten, and gather to be with thee; and it shall be for thee and for them to eat. 
And Noach did according to all which the Lord had commanded him, so did he.
