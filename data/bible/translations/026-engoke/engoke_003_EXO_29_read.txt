Exodus.
Chapter 29.
And this is the thing which thou shalt do to them, to consecrate them to minister before Me: Take one bullock, the young of a bullock, and two rams unblemished; 
And unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened which are anointed with oil; of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 
And thou shalt put them on one basket, and bring them in the basket, and the bullock and the two rams, 
And Aharon and his sons thou shalt bring to the door of the tabernacle of ordinance, and wash them with water. 
And thou shalt take the vestments, and dress Aharon with the tunic and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod and the breastplate, and shalt ordain him with the girdle of the ephod. 
And thou shalt set the tiara on his head, and put the diadem of Holiness upon the tiara. 
And thou shalt take the oil of anointing, and pour upon his head to anoint him. 
And thou shalt bring his sons near, and dress them in the tunics 
And gird them with the girdles, Aharon and his sons; and thou shalt set on them the mitres, and it shall be to them a priesthood, by a perpetual statute. And thou shalt offer the oblation for Aharon and the oblation for his sons. 
And the bullock shalt thou offer before the tabernacle of ordinance. And Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock; 
And thou shalt slay the bullock before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance. 
And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and all the blood (that remains) thou shalt pour out at the base of the altar. 
And thou shalt take all the fat which covereth the inwards, and the caul that is upon the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and sacrifice them upon the altar. 
And the flesh of the bullock, his skin, and his dung, burn thou with fire without the camp; it is a sin offering. 
And thou shalt take the one ram, and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram; 
And thou shalt kill the ram, and take his blood, and sprinkle upon the altar round about. 
And the ram thou shalt divide by his members, and shalt cleanse his inwards, and his legs, and put them upon his members, and upon his head, 
and thou shalt sacrifice the ram at the altar; it is a holocaust before the Lord, to be accepted with favour, an oblation before the Lord. 
And thou shalt take the second ram, and Aharon and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 
And thou shalt kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it on the tip of Aharon’s ear, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the toe of their right foot; and thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
And thou shalt take of the blood which is upon the altar, and of the oil of anointing, and drop it on Aharon and on his vestments, and on his sons, and on the vestments of his sons with him, and he shall be consecrated, he and his vestments, and his sons, and the vestments of his sons with him. 
And thou shalt take of the ram, the fat, and the tall, and the fat which covereth the inwards, and the caul which is on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, and the right shoulder, for it is a ram for oblation; 
And one loaf of bread, and one cake of bread (with) oil, and one wafer from the basket of the unleavened ones which is before the Lord: 
And put thou all upon the hands of Aharon and upon the hands of his sons, and uplift them for an elevation before the Lord; 
And take them from their hands, and offer them at the altar upon the burnt offering, that they may be received with acceptance before the Lord; it is an oblation before the Lord. 
And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aharon’s oblations, and uplift it, an elevation before the Lord; and it shall be thy portion. 
And thou shalt consecrate the breast of the elevation and the shoulder of separation which is uplifted and which is separated of the oblation-ram of Aharon and that of his sons; 
And it shall be for Aharon and for his sons by a perpetual statute for the sons of Israel, because it is a thing separated. And a separation shall be (taken) from the sons of Israel of their consecrated sacrifices, (even) their separation before the Lord. 
And the sacred garments of Aharon shall be his sons’ after him, to be anointed in them, (and) in them to offer their oblations. 
Seven days shall the priest wear them, who of his sons (is to be anointed) instead of him, and who shall enter into the tabernacle of ordinance to minister in the sanctuary. 
And the ram of the oblations thou shalt take, and boil his flesh in the holy place. 
And Aharon and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is on the basket at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance. 
And they may eat those things by which propitiation is made in offering them as oblations to consecrate them; but an alien may not eat, because they are sacred. 
And if any (part) of the flesh of the oblations or of the bread remain until the morning, the remainder shall be burned with fire; it shall not be eaten, it is sacred. 
And thou shalt do (thus) to Aharon and to his sons, according to all that I have prescribed to thee: seven days shalt thou offer their oblations. 
A bullock that is a sin offering thou shalt perform daily for expiation, and thou shalt make purification upon the altar in making expiation upon it, and shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
Seven days must thou make expiation on the altar to sanctify it, and the altar shall be most holy; whosoever shall touch the altar let him be sanctified. 
And this is what thou shalt perform upon the altar: Two lambs, the offspring of the year, for the day continually. 
The one lamb thou shalt perform in the morning, and the second lamb thou shalt perform between the evenings. 
And a tenth of flour, sprinkled with the fourth of a hina of beaten oil, and a libation of the fourth of a hina of wine, to one lamb. 
And the second lamb thou shalt perform between the evenings, as the oblation of the morning, and as its libation thou shalt perform it to be received with acceptance, an oblation before the Lord. 
A perpetual holocaust unto your generations at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance before the Lord, where I have appointed My Word with you, to speak with you there. 
And I will appoint My Word there unto the sons of Israel, and (with) My glory will I sanctify (it). 
And I will sanctify the tabernacle of ordinance, and the altar, and Aharon, and his sons will I sanctify to minister before Me. 
And I will cause My Shekinah to dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will be their God. 
And they shall know that I am the Lord their God who brought them out from the land of Mizraim, that I may make My Shekinah to dwell among them. I am the Lord their God.
