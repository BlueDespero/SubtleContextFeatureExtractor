Exodus.
Chapter 34.
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Hew thee two tablets of stone as the first ones, and I will write upon the tablets the words that were upon the former tablets which thou hast broken. 
And be ready in the morning, and go up at morn to Mount Sinai, and stand there before Me on the summit of the mountain. 
Let no man ascend with thee; let no man be seen upon all the mountain, nor sheep nor oxen be grazing upon the mountain. 
And hew two tablets of stone like the former ones. And Mosheh arose in the morning, and ascended Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone. 
And the Lord was revealed in the Cloud, and He stood with him there, and He proclaimed the Name of the Lord. 
And the Lord made His Shekinah pass before his face; and he proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, Merciful and Gracious, slow to anger, and making goodness and truth to abound; 
Keeping goodness for thousands of generations; Forgiving iniquity and rebellion and guilt; Pardoning them who convert unto His law, but acquitting not them who convert not; Visiting the guilt of fathers upon the children and upon the children’s children of the rebellious, upon the third and upon the fourth generation. 
And Mosheh made haste, and bowed upon the ground and worshipped. 
And he said, If now I have found mercy before Thee, O Lord, let, I pray, the Shekinah of the Lord go among us; for it is a hard-necked people; but forgive Thou our guilty and our sin, and take possession of us. 
And He said, Behold, I make a covenant before all thy people that I will do wonders which were never created upon all the earth, nor among any of the people; and all peoples among whom thou art shall see the work of the Lord; for terrible shall that be which I will do with thee. 
Observe thou that which I command thee this day. Behold, I will drive out from before thee the Amoraee, and Kenaanaee, and Hittaee, and Pherizaee, and Hivaee, and Jebusaee. 
Beware lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land upon which thou shalt enter, lest it become a stumbling-block in the midst of thee: 
But their altars thou shalt destroy, and their statues break, and their groves cut down; 
For thou shalt not worship the idols of the peoples; for the Lord, Zealous is His Name, a zealous God is He. 
Lest thou strike a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and go erring after their idols, and to their idols offer sacrifices, and they invite thee, and thou eat of their sacrifices, 
And thou take of their daughters for thy sons, and they make thy daughters go erring after their idols, and thy sons to go erring after their idols. 
Molten gods thou shalt not make to thee. 
The feast of the unleavened thou shalt keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened (bread) as I have commanded thee, in the time of the month of Abiva; for in the month of Abiva thou didst come out of Mizraim. 
All that openeth the womb is Mine; all males of cattle thou shalt sanctify, the first-born of oxen and of sheep. 
But the firstling of an ass thou mayest redeem with a lamb; but if thou redeem him not, thou shalt cut him off. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And let none appear before Me empty. 
Six days thou shalt labour, and on the seventh day rest; in sowing (time) and in reaping thou shalt rest. 
And the feast of Weeks thou shalt make to thee, of the firsts of the wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering in the cycle of the year. 
Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the Master of the World, the Lord God of Israel. 
For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders, and no man shall covet thy land when thou goest up to appear before the Lord thy God three times in the year. 
Thou shalt not sacrifice the blood of My Pascha with leaven, nor shall the fat of the sacrifices of the Paschal feast be left without the altar till the morning. 
The chief of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the sanctuary of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not eat flesh with milk. 
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Write for thee these words; for upon the expression of these words I make covenant with thee and with Israel. 
And he was there before the Lord forty days and forty nights; bread he ate not, nor water did he drink; and he wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Words. 
And it was when Mosheh descended from the mountain of Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in the hand of Mosheh, in his descending from the mount, that Mosheh knew not how great was the splendour of the glory of his countenance through His speaking with him. 
And Aharon and all the sons of Israel saw Mosheh, and, behold, great was the splendour of the glory of his countenance, and they were afraid to approach him. 
But Mosheh called to them, and Aharon and all the chiefs of the congregation returned to him, and Mosheh conversed with them. 
And afterward all the sons of Israel drew near, and he taught them all that the Lord had said to him on Mount Sinai. 
And when Mosheh had completed to speak with them, he put a veil upon his face. 
But when Mosheh went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he removed the veil until he came out. And he went forth and spake with the sons of Israel of that which was commanded. 
And the children of Israel saw the face of Mosheh, that the splendour of the glory of Mosheh’s face was great; and Mosheh put the veil again upon his face until he went in to speak with Him.
