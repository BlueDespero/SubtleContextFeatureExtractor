Song of Solomon.
Chapter 7.
Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, and we will look at thee. What will ye see in the Shulammite? She comes as bands of armies. 
Thy steps are beautiful in shoes, O daughter of the prince: The joints of thy thighs are like chains, The work of the craftsman. 
Thy navel is as a turned bowl, Not wanting liquor; Thy belly is as a heap of wheat Set about with lilies. 
Thy two breasts are as two twin fawns. 
Thy neck is as an ivory tower; Thine eyes are as pools in Heshbon, By the gates of the daughter of many: Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon, Looking toward Damascus. 
Thy head upon thee is as Carmel, And the curls of thy hair like scarlet; The king is bound in the galleries. 
How beautiful art thou, And how sweet art thou, my love! 
This is thy greatness in thy delights: Thou wast made like a palm tree, And thy breasts to clusters. 
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its high boughs: And now shall thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy nose as apples; 
And thy throat as good wine, Going well with my kinsman, Suiting my lips and teeth. 
I am my kinsman’s, And his desire is toward me. 
Come, my kinsman, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages. 
Let us go early into the vineyards; Let us see if the vine has flowered, If the blossoms have appeared, If the pomegranates have blossomed; There will I give thee my breasts. 
The mandrakes have given a smell, And at our doors are all kinds of choice fruits, new and old. O my kinsman, I have kept them for thee.
