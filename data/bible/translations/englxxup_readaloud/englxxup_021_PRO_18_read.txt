Proverbs.
Chapter 18.
A man who wishes to separate from friends seeks excuses; But at all times he will be liable to reproach. 
A senseless man feels no need of wisdom, For he is rather led by folly. 
When an ungodly man comes into a depth of evils, he despises them; But dishonor and reproach come upon him. 
A word in the heart of a man is a deep water, And a river and fountain of life spring forth. 
It is not good to accept the person of the ungodly, Nor is it holy to pervert justice in judgment. 
The lips of a fool bring him into troubles, And his bold mouth calls for death. 
A fool’s mouth is ruin to him, And his lips are a snare to his soul. 
Fear casts down the slothful; And the souls of the effeminate shall hunger. 
A man who helps not himself by his labor Is brother of him that ruins himself. 
The name of the Lord is of great strength; And the righteous running to it are exalted. 
The wealth of a rich man is a strong city; And its glory casts a broad shadow. 
Before ruin a man’s heart is exalted, And before honor it is humble. 
Whoso answers a word before he hears a cause, It is folly and reproach to him. 
A wise servant calms a man’s anger; But who can endure a faint-hearted man? 
The heart of the sensible man purchases discretion; And the ears of the wise seek understanding. 
A man’s gift enlarges him, And seats him among princes. 
A righteous man accuses himself at the beginning of his speech, But when he has entered upon the attack, the adversary is reproved. 
A silent man quells strifes, And determines between great powers. 
A brother helped by a brother is as a strong and high city; And is as strong as a well-founded palace. 
A man fills his belly with the fruits of his mouth; And he shall be satisfied with the fruits of his lips. 
Life and death are in the power of the tongue; And they that rule it shall eat the fruits thereof. 
He that has found a good wife has found favors, And has received gladness from God. 
He that puts away a good wife, puts away a good thing, And he that keeps an adulteress is foolish and ungodly.
