Psalms.
Chapter 60.
For the end, among the Hymns of David. 
O God, hearken to my petition; Attend to my prayer. 
From the ends of the earth have I cried to thee, When my heart was in trouble: Thou liftedst me up on a rock, Thou didst guide me: 
because thou wert my hope, A tower of strength from the face of the enemy. 
I will dwell in thy tabernacle forever; I will shelter myself under the shadow of thy wings. Pause. 
For thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; Thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name. 
Thou shalt add days to the days of the king; Thou shalt lengthen his years to all generations. 
He shall endure forever before God: Which of them will seek out his mercy and truth? 
So will I sing to thy name forever and ever, That I may daily perform my vows.
