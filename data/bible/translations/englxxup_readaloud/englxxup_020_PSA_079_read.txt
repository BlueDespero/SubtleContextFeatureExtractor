Psalms.
Chapter 79.
For the end, for alternate strains, a testimony for Asaph, a Psalm concerning the Assyrian. 
Attend, O Shepherd of Israel, Who guidest Joseph like a flock; Thou who sittest upon the cherubs, manifest thyself; 
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, Stir up thy power, And come to deliver us. 
Turn us, O God, And cause thy face to shine; and we shall be delivered. 
O Lord God of hosts, How long art thou angry with the prayer of thy servant? 
Thou wilt feed us with bread of tears; And wilt cause us to drink tears by measure. 
Thou hast made us a strife to our neighbors; And our enemies have mocked at us. 
Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, And cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. Pause. 
Thou hast transplanted a vine out of Egypt: Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 
Thou madest a way before it, And didst cause its roots to strike, and the land was filled with it. 
Its shadow covered the mountains, And its shoots equaled the goodly cedars. 
It sent forth its branches to the sea, And its shoots to the river. 
Wherefore hast thou broken down its hedge, While all that pass by the way pluck it? 
The boar out of the wood has laid it waste, And the wild beast has devoured it. 
O God of hosts, turn, we pray thee: Look on us from heaven, And behold and visit this vine; 
And restore that which thy right hand has planted: And look on the son of man whom thou didst strengthen for thyself. 
It is burned with fire and dug up: They shall perish at the rebuke of thy presence. 
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, And upon the son of man whom thou didst strengthen for thyself. 
So will we not depart from thee: Thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name. 
Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, And make thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
