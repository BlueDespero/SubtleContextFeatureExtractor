Psalms.
Chapter 29.
For the end, a Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David. 
I will exalt thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, And not caused mine enemies to rejoice over me. 
O Lord my God, I cried to thee, and thou didst heal me. 
O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from Hades, Thou hast delivered me from among them that go down to the pit. 
Sing to the Lord, ye his saints, And give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness. 
For anger is in his wrath, But life in his favor: Weeping shall tarry for the evening, But joy shall be in the morning. 
And I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 
O Lord, in thy good pleasure thou didst add strength to my beauty: But thou didst turn away thy face, and I was troubled. 
To thee, O Lord, will I cry; And to my God will I make supplication. 
What profit is there in my blood, When I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to thee? Or shall it declare thy truth? 
The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; The Lord is become my helper. 
Thou hast turned my mourning into joy for me: Thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 
That my glory may sing praise to thee, and I may not be pierced with sorrow. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to thee forever.
