Psalms.
Chapter 124.
A Song of Degrees. They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion: He that dwells in Jerusalem shall never be moved. 
The mountains are round about her, And so the Lord is round about his people, From henceforth and even forever. 
For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners To be upon the lot of the righteous; Lest the righteous should stretch forth Their hands to iniquity. 
Do good, O Lord, to them that are good, And to them that are upright in heart. 
But them that turn aside to crooked ways The Lord will lead away with the workers of iniquity: But peace shall be upon Israel.
