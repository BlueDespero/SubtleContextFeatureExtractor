Psalms.
Chapter 35.
For the end, by David the servant of the Lord. 
The transgressor, that he may sin, says within himself, That there is no fear of God before his eyes. 
For he has dealt craftily before him, To discover his iniquity and hate it. 
The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: He is not inclined to understand how to do good. 
He devises iniquity on his bed; He gives himself to every evil way; And does not abhor evil. 
O Lord, thy mercy is in the heaven; And thy truth reaches to the clouds. 
Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God, Thy judgments are as a great deep: O Lord, thou wilt preserve men and beasts. 
How hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! So the children of men shall trust in the shelter of thy wings. 
They shall be fully satisfied with the fatness of thy house; And thou shalt cause them to drink of the full stream of thy delights. 
For with thee is the fountain of life: In thy light we shall see light. 
Extend thy mercy to them that know thee; And thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
Let not the foot of pride come against me, And let not the hand of sinners move me. 
There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: They are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
