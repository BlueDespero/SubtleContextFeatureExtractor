Psalms.
Chapter 127.
A Song of Degrees. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord; Who walk in his ways. 
Thou shalt eat the labors of thy hands: Blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine On the sides of thy house: Thy children as young olive plants Round about thy table. 
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord. 
May the Lord bless thee out of Zion; And mayest thou see the prosperity of Jerusalem All the days of thy life. 
And mayest thou see thy children’s children. Peace be upon Israel.
