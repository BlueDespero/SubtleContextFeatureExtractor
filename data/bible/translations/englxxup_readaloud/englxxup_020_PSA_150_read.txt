Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Alleluia. Praise God in his holy places: Praise him in the firmament of his power. 
Praise him on account of his mighty acts: Praise him according to his abundant greatness. 
Praise him with the sound of a trumpet: Praise him with psaltery and harp. 
Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and the organ. 
Praise him with melodious cymbals: Praise him with loud cymbals. 
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.
