Psalms.
Chapter 99.
A Psalm for Thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth. 
Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before his presence with exultation. 
Know that the Lord he is God; He made us, and not we ourselves; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And his courts with hymns; Give thanks to him, praise his name. 
For the Lord is good, his mercy is forever; And his truth endures to generation and generation.
