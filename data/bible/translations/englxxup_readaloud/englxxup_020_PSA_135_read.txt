To him who alone has wrought great wonders: For his mercy endures forever. 
To him who made the heavens by understanding; For his mercy endures forever. 
To him who established the earth on the waters; For his mercy endures forever. 
To him who alone made great lights; For his mercy endures forever. 
The sun to rule the day; For his mercy endures forever. 
The moon and the stars to rule the night; For his mercy endures forever. 
To him who smote Egypt with their firstborn; For his mercy endures forever. 
And brought Israel out of the midst of them; For his mercy endures forever: 
With a strong hand, and a high arm: For his mercy endures forever. 
To him who divided the Red Sea into parts: For his mercy endures forever: 
And brought Israel through the midst of it: For his mercy endures forever:

And Og king of Bashan: For his mercy endures forever: 
And gave their land for an inheritance: For his mercy endures forever: 
Even an inheritance to Israel his servant: For his mercy endures forever. 
For the Lord remembered us in our low estate; For his mercy endures forever: 
And redeemed us from our enemies; For his mercy endures forever. 
Who gives food to all flesh; For his mercy endures forever. 
Give thanks to the God of heaven; For his mercy endures forever.
