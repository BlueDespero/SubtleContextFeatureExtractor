Psalms.
Chapter 11.
For the end, a Psalm of David, upon the eighth. 
Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; For truth is diminished from among the children of men. 
Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbor: Their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. 
Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, And the tongue that speaks great words: 
Who have said, We will magnify our tongue; Our lips are our own: who is Lord of us? 
Because of the misery of the poor, And because of the sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set them in safety; I will speak to them thereof openly. 
The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; As silver tried in the fire, proved in a furnace of earth, Purified seven times. 
Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, And shalt preserve us, from this generation, and forever. 
The ungodly walk around: According to thy greatness thou hast greatly exalted the sons of men.
