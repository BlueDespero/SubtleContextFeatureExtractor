Job.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 
What beginning or fear is his— Even he that makes all things in the highest? 
For let none think that there is a respite for robbers: And upon whom will there not come a snare from him? 
For how shall a mortal be just before the Lord? Or who that is born of a woman shall purify himself? 
If he gives an order to the moon, then it shines not; And the stars are not pure before him. 
But alas! man is corruption, And the son of man a worm.
