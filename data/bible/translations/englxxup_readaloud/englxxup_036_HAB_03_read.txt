Habakkuk.
Chapter 3.
A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk, with a song. 
O Lord, I have heard thy report, and was afraid: I considered thy works, and was amazed: Thou shalt be known between the two living creatures, Thou shalt be acknowledged when the years draw nigh; Thou shalt be manifested when the time is come; When my soul is troubled, thou wilt in wrath remember mercy. 
God shall come from Teman, And the Holy One from the dark shady Mount Paran. Pause. 
His excellence covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness shall be as light; There were horns in his hands, And he caused a mighty love of his strength. 
Before his face shall go a report, And it shall go forth into the plains, 
The earth stood at his feet and trembled: He beheld, and the nations melted away: The mountains were violently burst through, The everlasting hills melted at his everlasting going forth. 
Because of troubles I looked upon the tents of the Ethiopians: The tabernacles also of the land of Midian shall be dismayed. 
Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? Or was thy wrath against the rivers, Or thine anger against the sea? For thou wilt mount on thy horses, And thy chariots are salvation. 
Surely thou didst bend thy bow At scepters, saith the Lord. Pause. The land of rivers shall be torn asunder. 
The nations shall see thee and be in pain, As thou dost divide the moving waters: The deep uttered her voice, And raised her form on high. 
The sun was exalted, and the moon stood still in her course: Thy darts shall go forth at the light, At the brightness of the gleaming of thine arms. 
Thou wilt bring low the land with threatening, And in wrath thou wilt break down the nations. 
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, To save thine anointed: Thou shalt bring death on the heads of transgressors; Thou hast brought bands upon their neck. Pause. 
Thou didst cut asunder the heads of princes with amazement, They shall tremble in it; They shall burst their bridles, They shall be as a poor man devouring in secret. 
And thou dost cause thy horses to enter the sea, Disturbing much water. 
I watched, and my belly trembled At the sound of the prayer of my lips, And trembling entered into my bones, And my frame was troubled within me; I will rest in the day of affliction, From going up to the people of my sojourning. 
For though the fig tree shall bear no fruit, And there shall be no produce on the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall produce no food: The sheep have failed from the pasture, And there are no oxen at the cribs; 
Yet I will exult in the Lord, I will joy in God my Savior. 
The Lord God is my strength, And he will perfectly strengthen my feet; He mounts me upon high places, That I may conquer by his song.
