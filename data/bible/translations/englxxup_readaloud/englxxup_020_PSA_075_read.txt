Psalms.
Chapter 75.
For the end, among the Hymns, a Psalm for Asaph; a Song for the Assyrian. 
God is known in Judea; His name is great in Israel. 
And his place has been in peace, And his dwelling place in Zion. 
There he broke the power of the bows, The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Pause. 
Thou dost wonderfully shine forth from the everlasting mountains. 
All the simple ones in heart were troubled; All the men of wealth have slept their sleep, And have found nothing in their hands. 
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, The riders on horses slumbered. 
Thou art terrible; and who shall withstand thee, Because of thine anger? 
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still, 
When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek in heart. Pause. 
For the inward thought of man shall give thanks to thee: And the memorial of his inward thought shall keep a feast to thee. 
Vow, and pay your vows to the Lord our God; All that are round about him shall bring gifts, Even to him that is terrible, 
and that takes away the spirits of princes; To him that is terrible among the kings of the earth.
