Psalms.
Chapter 83.
For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Korah, concerning the winepresses. 
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! 
My soul longs, and faints for the courts of the Lord: My heart and my flesh have exulted in the living God. 
Yea, the sparrow has found himself a home, And the turtledove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, My King, and my God. 
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will praise thee evermore. Pause. 
Blessed is the man whose help is of thee, O Lord; In his heart he has purposed to go up 
The Valley of Weeping, to the place which he has appointed, For there the lawgiver will grant blessings. 
They shall go from strength to strength: The God of gods shall be seen in Zion. 
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: Hearken, O God of Jacob. Pause. 
Behold, O God our defender, And look upon the face of thine anointed. 
For one day in thy courts is better than thousands. I would rather be an abject in the house of God, Than dwell in the tents of sinners. 
For the Lord loves mercy and truth: God will give grace and glory: The Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in innocence. 
O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in thee.
