Psalms.
Chapter 24.
A Psalm of David. To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul. 
O my God, I have trusted in thee: let me not be confounded, Neither let mine enemies laugh me to scorn. 
For none of them that wait on thee shall in anywise be ashamed: Let them be ashamed that transgress without cause. 
Show me thy ways, O Lord; And teach me thy paths. 
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: For thou art God my Savior: And I have waited on thee all the day. 
Remember thy compassions, O Lord, And thy mercies, for they are from everlasting. 
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my sins of ignorance: Remember me according to thy mercy, For thy goodness’ sake, O Lord. 
Good and upright is the Lord: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. 
The meek will he guide in judgment: The meek will he teach his ways. 
All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth To them that seek his covenant and his testimonies. 
For thy name’s sake, O Lord, Do thou also be merciful to my sin; for it is great. 
Who is the man that fears the Lord? He shall instruct him in the way which he has chosen. 
His soul shall dwell in prosperity; And his seed shall inherit the earth. 
The Lord is the strength of them that fear him; And his covenant is to manifest truth to them. 
Mine eyes are continually to the Lord; For he shall draw my feet out of the snare. 
Look upon me, and have mercy upon me; For I am an only child and poor. 
The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; Deliver me from my distresses. 
Look upon mine affliction and my trouble; And forgive all my sins. 
Look upon mine enemies; for they have been multiplied; And they have hated me with unjust hatred. 
Keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be ashamed; for I have hoped in thee. 
The harmless and upright joined themselves to me: For I waited for thee, O Lord. 
Deliver Israel, O God, Out of all his afflictions.
