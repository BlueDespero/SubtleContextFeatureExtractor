Psalms.
Chapter 136.
For David, a Psalm of Jeremiah. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat; And wept when we remembered Zion. 
We hung our harps on the willows in the midst of it. 
For there they that had taken us captive asked of us the words of a song; And they that had carried us away asked a hymn, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 
How should we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land? 
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill. 
May my tongue cleave to my throat, if I do not remember thee; If I do not prefer Jerusalem as the chief of my joy. 
Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; Who said, Raze it, raze it, even to its foundations. 
Wretched daughter of Babylon! Blessed shall he be who shall reward thee as thou hast rewarded us. 
Blessed shall he be who shall seize and dash thine infants against the rock.
