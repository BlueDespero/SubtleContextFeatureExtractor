Psalms.
Chapter 115.
Alleluia. I believed, wherefore I have spoken: But I was greatly afflicted. 
And I said in mine amazement, Every man is a liar. 
What shall I render to the Lord For all the things wherein he has rewarded me? 
I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows to the Lord, In the presence of all his people. 
Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of his saints. 
O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid: Thou hast burst my bonds asunder. 
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise, And will call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, In the presence of all his people, 
In the courts of the Lord’s house, In the midst of thee, Jerusalem.
