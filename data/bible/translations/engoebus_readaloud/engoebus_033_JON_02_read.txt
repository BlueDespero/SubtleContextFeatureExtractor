Jonah.
Chapter 2.
Jonah prayed to the Lord his God, out of the belly of the fish, 
and said: I cried out of my distress, to the Lord and he answered me; out of the midst of Sheol I cried aloud, and you heard my voice. 
For you cast me into the deep, into heart of the seas, and the great flood rolled about me; all your breakers and your waves passed over me. 
Then I said, I am driven out, away from your sight; How will I ever again look towards your holy temple? 
The waters surrounded me, the great deep engulfed me, the sea weeds were wrapped about my head. 
I went down to the roots of the mountains; the prison of the earth closed over me forever. Yet you brought up my life from destruction, O Lord my God. 
As my life slipped away, I remembered the Lord; and my prayer reached you, in your holy temple. 
Those who worship worthless idols abandon their own mercy, 
but I will sacrifice to you with loud thanksgiving! I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is the Lord's. 
And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it threw up Jonah upon the dry land.
