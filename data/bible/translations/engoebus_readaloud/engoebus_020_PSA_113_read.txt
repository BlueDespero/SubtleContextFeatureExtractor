Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Hallelujah. Praise the Lord, you his servants, praise the name of the Lord. 
The name of the Lord be blessed from now and for evermore. 
From sunrise to sunset is the name of the Lord to be praised. 
High is the Lord above all nations, above the heavens is his glory. 
Who is like the Lord our God, seated on high? 
He bends down to look at the heavens and earth. 
He raises the weak from the dust, he lifts the poor from the dunghill, 
and sets them beside the princes, even the princes of his people. 
He gives the childless woman a home, and makes her the happy mother of children. Hallelujah.
