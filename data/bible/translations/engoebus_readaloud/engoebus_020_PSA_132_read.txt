Psalms.
Chapter 132.
Remember, O Lord, David all his sufferings, 
the oath that he swore to the Lord, and his vow to the Strong One of Jacob, 
never to enter his tent, never to lie on his bed, 
never to give his eyes sleep or his eyelids slumber, 
till he had found a place for the Lord, for the Strong One of Jacob to live in. 
We heard of it in Ephrathah, in the fields of Jaar we found it. 
We went to the place where he dwelt, we bowed ourselves low at his footstool. 
“Arise, Lord, and enter your resting-place, you and your mighty ark. 
Let your priests wear a garment of righteousness, your faithful shout aloud for joy. 
For the sake of David your servant, do not reject your Anointed.” 
The Lord swore an oath to David an oath that he will not break; “I will set on your throne a prince of your line. 
If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons, too, forever, will sit on your throne.” 
For the choice of the Lord is Zion; she is the home of his heart. 
“This is forever my resting-place, this is the home of my heart. 
I will royally bless her provision, and give bread to her poor in abundance. 
Her priests I will clothe with salvation; her faithful will shout for joy. 
There will I raise up for David a dynasty of power. I have set my anointed a lamp that shall never go out. 
Robes of shame I will put on his foes, but on his head a glittering crown.”
