Psalms.
Chapter 14.
For the leader. Of David. Fools say in their heart, “There is no God.” Vile, hateful their life is; not one does good. 
From heaven the Lord looks out on humans, to see if any are wise, and care for God. 
But all have turned bad, the taint is on all; not one does good, no, not one. 
Have they learned their lesson, those workers of evil? Who ate up my people, eating, devouring, never calling to the Lord. 
Sore afraid will they be; for God is among those who are righteous, 
you may mock the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge. 
If only help from Zion would come for Israel! When the Lord brings his people a change of fortune, how glad will be Jacob, and Israel how joyful!
