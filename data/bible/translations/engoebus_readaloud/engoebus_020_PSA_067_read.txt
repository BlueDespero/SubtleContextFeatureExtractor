Psalms.
Chapter 67.
For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song. Bless us, O God, with your favor, let the light of your face fall upon us; Selah 
that the world may know your way, and all nations your power to save. 
Let the peoples praise you, O God; let the peoples all of them praise you. 
Let the nations ring out their joy; for you govern the peoples with equity, and guide the nations on earth. Selah 
Let the peoples praise you, O God, let the peoples, all of them, praise you. 
The earth has yielded her increase by the blessing of God, our God. 
May this blessing of ours win people to him to all the ends of the earth.
