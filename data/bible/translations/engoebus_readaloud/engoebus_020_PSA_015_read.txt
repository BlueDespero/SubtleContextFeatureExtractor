Psalms.
Chapter 15.
A psalm of David. Lord, who can be guest in your tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? 
The person whose walk is blameless, whose conduct is right, whose words are true and sincere; 
on whose tongue there sits no slander, who will not harm a friend, 
nor cruelly insult a neighbor, who regards with contempt those rejected by God; but honors those who obey the Lord, who keeps an oath, whatever the cost, 
whose money is lent without interest, and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent. The person who does these things will always stand firm.
