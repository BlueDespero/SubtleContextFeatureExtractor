John.
Chapter 4.
When therefore Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
(though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,) 
he left Judaea, and went again to Galilee. 
And he must necessarily pass through Samaria. 
He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the piece of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
And Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with the journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. 
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink. 
For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. 
The Samaritan woman saith to him, How is it that thou, who art a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. 
Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Whence hast thou the living water? 
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 
Jesus answered and said to her, Every one that drinketh of this water, will thirst again; 
but whoever drinketh of the water that I will give him, will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become within him a well of water springing up to everlasting life. 
The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw. 
He saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
The woman answered, I have no husband. Jesus saith to her, Thou saidst well, that thou hast no husband. 
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; in this thou hast spoken truly. 
The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
Jesus saith to her, Believe me, woman, the hour is coming, when ye shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
Ye worship that which ye know not; we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. 
But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for such worshippers the Father seeketh. 
God is a spirit; and they who worship must worship in spirit and in truth. 
The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh (who is called Christ); when he hath come, he will tell us all things. 
Jesus saith to her, I who speak to thee am he. 
And upon this his disciples came, and marveled that he was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, What dost thou seek? or, Why dost thou talk with her? 
The woman then left her water-pot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men, 
Come, see a man who told me all things which I have done. Is this the Christ? 
They went out of the city, and came to him. 
In the mean while the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat. 
But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of. 
The disciples therefore said to one another, Hath any one brought him anything to eat? 
Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
Do ye not say, There are yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Lo! I say to you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest. 
Already is the reaper receiving wages, and gathering fruit unto everlasting life; that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. 
And herein is fulfilled the true saying, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
I have sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored. Others have labored, and ye have entered into their labor. 
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him because of the words of the woman, who testified, He told me all things which I have done. 
When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to remain with them; and he remained there two days. 
And many more believed on account of his word; 
and said to the woman, No longer do we believe on account of what thou hast told us; for we have ourselves heard him, and know that this is in truth the Saviour of the world. 
And after the two days he went from that place into Galilee. 
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country. 
When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast. 
So he came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick, at Capernaum. 
He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him, and asked him to go down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death. 
Then Jesus said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down before my child die. 
Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went away. 
And as he was now going down, the servants met him, and brought word that his child was living. 
Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to mend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
So the father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son is living. And he himself believed, and his whole house. 
This again, a second sign, Jesus wrought, when he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.
