Hebrews.
Chapter 7.
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, 
to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all, who by interpretation is first King of righteousness, and then also was King of Salem, which is, King of peace, 
without father, without mother, without record of descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, remaineth a priest for ever. 
Consider now how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils. 
And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a command to take tithes of the people by the Law, that is, of their brethren, though they have come out of the loins of Abraham; 
but he whose descent is not reckoned from them took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises. 
And beyond all contradiction the less is blessed by the greater. 
And here indeed men that die receive tithes; but there he of whom it is testified that he liveth. 
And so to speak, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes in Abraham; 
for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. 
If indeed perfection had been by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people hath received the Law,) what further need was there that a different priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called alter the order of Aaron? 
For if the priesthood is changed, there takes place of necessity a change of the law. 
For he of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, of which no one hath given attendance at the altar; 
for it is well-known that our Lord sprang out of Judah, in regard to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 
And it is still more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth a different priest, 
who hath been made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life. 
For it is testified of him, “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.” 
For on the one hand there takes place an annulling of the commandment which went before, on account of its weakness and unprofitableness,— 
for the Law perfected nothing,—and on the other, the bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw near to God. 
And inasmuch as it was not without an oath that he was made priest, 
—for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him who said to him, “The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever,”— 
by so much hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant. 
And they indeed have been many priests, because they have been prevented from continuing by reason of death; 
but he, because he abideth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood; 
wherefore he is able also to save to the utmost those who come to God through him, since he ever liveth to make intercession for them. 
For such a high-priest also became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
who hath not necessity daily, as the high-priests, to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself. 
For the Law maketh men high-priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the Law, maketh the Son, who is perfected for ever.
