Isaiah.
Chapter 21.
The prophecy concerning the desert of the sea. As storms which rush along through the south, So it cometh from the desert, From the terrible land. 
A grievous vision was revealed to me; The plunderer plundereth, and the destroyer destroyeth. “Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! All sighing do I make to cease.” 
Therefore are my loins full of pain; Pangs have seized me, as the pangs of a woman in travail; For convulsions I cannot hear; For anguish I cannot see. 
My heart panteth, Terror hath seized upon me; The evening of my desire is changed into horror. 
The table is prepared; the watch is set; They eat; they drink; “Arise, ye princes! Anoint the shield!” 
For thus said the Lord unto me: “Go, set a watchman, Who shall declare what he seeth.” 
And he saw a troop, horsemen in pairs, Riders on asses, and riders on camels, And he watched with the utmost heed. 
Then he cried like a lion: “My Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the daytime, And keep my post all the night; 
And behold, there cometh a troop, Horsemen in pairs.” Again also he lifted up his voice, and said: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon, And all the graven images of her gods are cast broken to the ground.” 
O my threshing, and the corn of my floor! What I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, That have I declared to you. 
The prophecy concerning Dumah. A voice came to me from Seir: “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?” 
The watchman saith: “Morning cometh, and also night. If ye will inquire, inquire! Return, come!” 
The prophecy against the Arabians. In the thickets of Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedan! 
The inhabitants of the land of Tema Bring water to the thirsty; They come to meet the fugitive with bread. 
For they flee from swords, From the drawn sword, And from the bent bow, And from the fury of war. 
For thus saith the Lord to me: Within one year, according to the years of a hireling, Shall all the glory of Kedar be consumed. 
The remainder of the mighty bowmen of the sons of Kedar shall be diminished; For Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath said it.
