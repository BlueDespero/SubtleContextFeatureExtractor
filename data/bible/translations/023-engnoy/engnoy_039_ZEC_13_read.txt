Zechariah.
Chapter 13.
In that day there shall be a fountain opened To the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For sin and for uncleanness. 
And it shall come to pass in that day, Saith Jehovah of hosts, That I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, And they shall no more be remembered; And the prophets also, and the impure spirit, Will I cause to pass out of the land. 
And it shall come to pass, when any one shall yet prophesy, That his father and mother shall say to him, Even they that begat him, “Thou shalt not live; For thou hast spoken falsehood in the name of Jehovah.” And his father and mother that begat him shall pierce him through when he prophesieth. 
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophet shall be ashamed Every one of his vision when he prophesieth; Neither shall they wear a garment of hair, to deceive. 
But each shall say, “I am no prophet; I am a man that tilleth the ground; For a man hath purchased me from my youth.” 
And when one shall say to him, “What are these wounds in thy hands?” He shall answer, “Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.” 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, Even against the man who is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts! Smite the shepherd, and let the sheep be scattered! I will also turn my hand against the lambs. 
And it shall come to pass in all the land, saith Jehovah, That two parts therein shall be cut off and die; But the third part shall be left therein. 
And I will bring the third part through the fire, And will refine them, as silver is refined, And will try them, as gold is tried; They shall call upon me, and I will hear them; I will say, “It is my people.” And they shall say, “Jehovah is our God.”
