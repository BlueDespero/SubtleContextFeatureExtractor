Psalms.
Chapter 121.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” I lift up mine eyes to the hills: Whence cometh my help? 
My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. 
He will not suffer thy foot to stumble; Thy guardian doth not slumber. 
Behold, the guardian of Israel Doth neither slumber nor sleep. 
The LORD is thy guardian; The LORD is thy shade at thy right hand. 
The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night. 
The LORD will preserve thee from all evil; He will preserve thy life. 
The LORD will preserve thee, when thou goest out and when thou comest in, From this time forth for ever.
