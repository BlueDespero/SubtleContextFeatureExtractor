Acts.
Chapter 9.
But Saul, yet breathing out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, 
and asked of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any who were of this way of belief, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone around a him a light from heaven; 
and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he answered, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
But arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. 
And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one. 
And Saul arose from the earth; but when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. 
And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. 
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias, and to him the Lord said in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 
And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for lo! he prayeth, 
and hath seen a man, named Ananias, coming in and putting his hand on him, that he might receive sight. 
But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how great evils he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem. 
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. 
But the Lord said to him, Go; for this man is to me a chosen vessel, to bear my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel. 
For I myself will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. 
And Ananias went away, and entered the house; and putting his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus who appeared to thee in the way thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayst receive sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
And immediately there fell off from his eyes as it were scales; and he received sight, and arose, and was baptized. 
And having taken some food he was strengthened. And he was some days with the disciples in Damascus. 
And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 
And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name? And he hath come hither for this purpose, that he may bring them bound to the chief priests. 
But Saul gained still more strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ. 
But after many days had passed, the Jews took counsel together to kill him; 
but their plot became known to Saul; and they were even watching the gates day and night to kill him. 
But his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join himself to the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. 
But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and hew he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. 
And he was with them going in and out at Jerusalem, 
speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. And he often spoke and disputed with the Hellenists; but they were endeavoring to slay him. 
But the brethren obtaining knowledge of it, brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
The church therefore throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up, and walking in the fear of the Lord; and by the exhortation of the Holy Spirit it was greatly increased. 
And it came to pass, that as Peter went through the whole country, he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda. 
And there he found a certain man named AEneas, who had lain on a bed eight years, and was palsied. 
And Peter said to him, AEneas, Jesus the Christ healeth thee; arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord. 
Now at Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which name being interpreted is the same as Dorcas, that is, Gazelle. This woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did. 
And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. 
And as Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent to him two men with the entreaty, Do not delay to come to us. 
Then Peter arose, and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all the widows came to him weeping, and showing the coats and cloaks which Dorcas made while she was with them. 
But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and seeing Peter, she sat up. 
And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and the widows, he presented her alive. 
And it became known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. 
And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
