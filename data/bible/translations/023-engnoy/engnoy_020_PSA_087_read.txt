Psalms.
Chapter 87.
“A psalm of the sons of Korah.” His foundation is in the holy mountains; 
Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God! Pause. 
“I name Egypt and Babylon among them that know me; Behold! Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia,—They also were born there.” 
And of Zion it shall be said, “Men of every nation were born there, And the Most High hath established her.” 
Jehovah, when he numbereth the nations, shall write, “These were born there!” Pause. 
Singers as well as dancers,—All my springs are in thee!
