Psalms.
Chapter 116.
I rejoice that the LORD hath heard the voice of my supplication, 
That he hath inclined his ear to me and heard me; I will call upon him as long as I live. 
The snares of death encompassed me, And the pains of the underworld seized upon me; I found distress and sorrow. 
Then called I upon the LORD: O LORD! deliver me! 
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful. 
The LORD preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and he helped me. 
Return, O my soul! to thy rest! For the LORD hath dealt kindly with thee. 
For thou hast preserved me from death; Thou hast kept mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling! 
I shall walk before the LORD, In the land of the living. 
I had trust, although I said, “I am grievously afflicted!” 
I said in my distress, “All men are liars.” 
What shall I render to the LORD For all his benefits to me? 
I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the LORD; 
I will pay my vows to the LORD, In the presence of all his people. 
Precious in the eyes of the LORD Is the death of his holy ones. 
Hear, O LORD! for I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid! Thou hast loosed my bonds. 
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the LORD. 
I will pay my vows to the LORD In the presence of all his people, 
In the courts of the house of the LORD, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem! Praise ye the LORD!
