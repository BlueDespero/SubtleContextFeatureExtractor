Psalms.
Chapter 132.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” O LORD! remember David, And all his affliction! 
How he sware to Jehovah, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 
“I will not go into my house, Nor lie down on my bed, 
I will not give sleep to my eyes, Nor slumber to my eyelids, 
Until I find a place for Jehovah, A habitation for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 
Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah; We found it in the fields of the forest. 
Let us go into his habitation; Let us worship at his footstool! 
Arise, O LORD! into thy rest, Thou, and the ark of thy strength! 
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, And thy holy ones shout for joy! 
For the sake of thy servant David, Reject not the prayer of thine anointed! 
Jehovah hath sworn in truth unto David, And he will not depart from it: “Of the fruit of thy body will I place upon the throne for thee. 
If thy children keep my covenant, And my statutes, which I teach them, Their children also throughout all ages Shall sit upon thy throne.” 
For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it as his dwelling-place. 
“This is my resting-place for ever; Here will I dwell, for I have chosen it. 
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
I will also clothe her priests with salvation, And her holy ones shall shout aloud for joy. 
There will I cause to spring forth a horn for David; I have prepared a light for mine anointed. 
His enemies will I clothe with shame, And the crown shall glitter upon his head.”
