Jeremiah.
Chapter 45.
The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch, the son of Neriah, after he had written these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying:— 
Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch! 
Thou sayest, “Woe now to me, for Jehovah hath added grief to my sorrow! I am weary with my sighing, and find no rest.” 
Thus shalt thou say to him: Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, that which I myself have builded do I break down, and that which I myself have planted do I pluck up, even this whole land; 
and seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not; for behold, I am about to bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah; but thy life will I give thee, as a prey, in all places whither thou shalt go.
