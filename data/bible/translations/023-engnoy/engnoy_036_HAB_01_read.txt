Habakkuk.
Chapter 1.
The prophecy which was revealed to the prophet Habakkuk. 
How long, O Jehovah, do I cry, and thou dost not hear! How long do I complain to thee of violence, and thou dost not save! 
Why dost thou suffer me to see iniquity, And why dost thou look upon wickedness? For spoiling and violence are before me; There is contention, and strife exalteth itself. 
Therefore the law faileth, And judgment is not pronounced according to truth; For the wicked encompasseth the righteous, Therefore wrong judgment is pronounced. 
Behold ye among the nations, and look! Yea, wonder, and be astonished! For I do a work in your days Which ye will not believe though it be told you. 
For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, A fierce and swift people, Which go over the breadth of the earth, To take possession of dwelling-places that are not their own. 
They are terrible and dreadful; From themselves go forth their law and their dignity. 
Their horses are swifter than leopards, And fiercer than evening wolves. Their horsemen leap proudly; Their horsemen come from far; They fly like an eagle, hastening to devour. 
All of them come for violence; The multitude of their faces is directed forwards, And they gather captives as sand. 
They also scoff at kings, And princes are to them a laughing-stock; They deride every stronghold, For they heap up earth and take it. 
Then their spirit is uplifted, and they transgress, and become guilty; This their strength is made their god. 
Art thou not from everlasting, O Jehovah, my God, my Holy One? We shall not die! Thou, O Jehovah, hast appointed them for judgment; Thou, O Rock, hast ordained them for chastisement. 
Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, And canst not look on wickedness; Why then dost thou look on transgressors, And art silent, when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he? 
And why makest thou men as the fishes of the sea, As the reptiles that have no ruler? 
They take up all of them with the hook, They catch them in their net, And gather them in their drag; Therefore they rejoice and exult. 
Therefore they sacrifice to their net, And burn incense to their drag; Because by them their portion is fat, And their food plenteous. 
Shall they therefore empty the net, And slay the nations continually without mercy?
