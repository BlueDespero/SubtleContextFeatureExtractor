Psalms.
Chapter 125.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” They who trust in the LORD shall be as Mount Zion, Which cannot be moved, which standeth for ever. 
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So the LORD is round about his people, Henceforth even for ever! 
For the sceptre of the wicked shall not remain upon the portion of the righteous, Lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity. 
Do good, O LORD! to the good, To them that are upright in heart! 
But such as turn aside to their crooked ways,-May the LORD destroy them with the evil-doers! Peace be to Israel!
