Matthew.
Chapter 11.
And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of his charge to his twelve disciples, that he departed thence, to teach and to preach in their cities. 
And John, having heard in the prison of the works of Christ, sent by his disciples, 
and said to him, Art thou he that is to come, or are we to look for another? 
And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John what ye hear and see. 
The blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and to the poor good tidings are brought; 
and blessed is he, whoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me. 
And, as these were going, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? the reeds shaken by the wind? 
But why did ye go out? to see a man clothed in soft raiment? Lo! they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. 
But why did ye go out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 
For this is he of whom it is written: “Lo! I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.” 
Truly do I say to you, Among those born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist. But he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent seize upon it. 
For all the Prophets and the Law, until John, prophesied. 
And if ye are willing to receive it, he is the Elijah who was to come. 
He that hath ears, let him hear. 
But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, who call to their fellows, 
and say, We piped to you, and ye did not dance; we sung a dirge, and ye did not lament. 
For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He hath a demon. 
The Son of man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her works. 
Then he began to upbraid the cities wherein most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent. 
Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. 
And thou, Capernaum! shalt thou be exalted to heaven? Thou shalt be brought down to the underworld; for if the miracles which were done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 
But I say to you, that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. 
At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though thou didst hide these things from the wise and discerning, thou didst reveal them to babes. 
Yea, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knoweth the Son but the Father; nor doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it is the will of the Son to reveal him. 
Come to me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest for your souls. 
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
