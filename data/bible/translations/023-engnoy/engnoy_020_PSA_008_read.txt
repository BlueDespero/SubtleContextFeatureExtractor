Psalms.
Chapter 8.
“For the leader of the music; to be accompanied with the gittith. A psalm of David.” O Jehovah, our Lord! How excellent is thy name in all the earth! Thou hast set thy glory above the heavens. 
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained praise, To put thine adversaries to shame, And to silence the enemy and avenger. 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained: 
What is man, that thou art mindful of him, And the son of man, that thou carest for him? 
Yet thou hast made him little lower than God; Thou hast crowned him with glory and honor. 
Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet,— 
All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the forest; 
The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, And whatever passeth through the paths of the deep. 
O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
