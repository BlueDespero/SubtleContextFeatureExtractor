Psalms.
Chapter 144.
Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, And my fingers to fight! 
He who is my loving-kindness and my fortress; My high tower and my deliverer, My shield, and he in whom I trust; Who subdueth peoples under me. 
LORD, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? 
Man is like a vapor; His day is like a shadow that passeth away. 
Bow thy heavens, O LORD! and come down; Touch the mountains, so that they shall smoke! 
Cast forth lightnings, and scatter them; Shoot forth thine arrows, and destroy them! 
Send forth thine hand from above; Rescue and save me from deep waters; From the hands of aliens, 
Whose mouth uttereth deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood! 
I will sing to thee a new song, O God! Upon a ten-stringed psaltery will I sing praise to thee; 
To thee, who givest salvation to kings, Who deliverest David, thy servant, from the destructive sword! 
Rescue and deliver me from the hands of aliens, Whose mouth uttereth deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood! 
That our sons may be as plants, Grown up in their youth; Our daughters as corner-pillars, Hewn like those of a palace! 
That our garners may be full, Affording all kinds of store; That our sheep may bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our streets. 
That our cattle may be fruitful; That there be no breaking in, or going out; And no outcry in our streets. 
Happy the people that is in such a state! Yea, happy the people whose God is Jehovah!
