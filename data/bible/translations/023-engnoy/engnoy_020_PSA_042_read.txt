Psalms.
Chapter 42.
“BOOK II. For the leader of the music. A song of the sons of Korah.” As the hart panteth for the water-brooks, So panteth my soul for thee, O God! 
My soul thirsteth for God, the living God: When shall I come, and appear before God? 
My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me continually, “Where is thy God?” 
When I think of it, I pour out my soul in grief; How I once walked with the multitude, Walked slowly with them to the house of God, Amid sounds of joy and praise with the festive multitude! 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God! 
My soul is cast down within me, While I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermon, From the mountain Mizar. 
Deep calleth for deep at the noise of thy waterfalls; All thy waves and billows have gone over me! 
Once the LORD commanded his kindness by day, And by night his praise was with me,-Thanksgiving to the God of my life. 
Now I say to God, my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning on account of the oppression of the enemy? 
Like the crushing of my bones are the reproaches of the enemy, While they say to me continually, “Where is thy God?” 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, Him, my deliverer and my God!
