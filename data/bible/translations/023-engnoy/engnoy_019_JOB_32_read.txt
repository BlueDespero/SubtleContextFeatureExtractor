Job.
Chapter 32.
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he accounted himself righteous rather than God. 
Against his three friends also was his wrath kindled, because they had not found an answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
Now Elihu had delayed to reply to Job, because they were older than himself. 
But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled. 
Then spake Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, and said: I am young, and ye are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And durst not make known to you my opinion. 
I said, “Days should speak, And the multitude of years should teach wisdom.” 
But it is the spirit in man, Even the inspiration of the Almighty, that giveth him understanding. 
Great men are not always wise, Nor do the aged always understand what is right. 
Therefore, I pray, listen to me: I also will declare my opinion. 
Behold, I have waited for your words, I have listened to your arguments, Whilst ye searched out what to say; 
Yea, I have attended to you; And behold, none of you hath refuted Job, Nor answered his words. 
Say not, then, “We have found out wisdom; God must conquer him, not man.” 
He hath not directed his discourse against me, And with speeches like yours will I not answer him. 
They were confounded! they answered no more! They could say nothing! 
I waited, but they spake not; They stood still; they answered no more! 
Therefore will I answer, on my part; I also will show my opinion. 
For I am full of matter; The spirit within me constraineth me. 
Behold, my bosom is as wine that hath no vent; Like bottles of new wine, which are bursting. 
I will speak, that I may be relieved; I will open my lips and answer. 
I will not be partial to any man's person, Nor will I flatter any man. 
For I know not how to flatter; Soon would my Maker take me away.
