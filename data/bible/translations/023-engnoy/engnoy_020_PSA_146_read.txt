Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Praise ye the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul! 
I will praise the LORD, as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God, while I have my being. 
Put not your trust in princes, In the son of man, in whom is no help! 
His breath goeth forth; he returneth to the dust; In that very day his plans perish. 
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help; Whose hope is in the LORD, his God; 
Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is therein; Who keepeth truth for ever; 
Who executeth judgment for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. The LORD setteth free the prisoners; 
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind; The LORD raiseth up them that are bowed down; The LORD loveth the righteous. 
The LORD preserveth the strangers; He relieveth the fatherless and the widow; But the way of the wicked he maketh crooked. 
The LORD shall reign for ever; Thy God, O Zion! to all generations! Praise ye the LORD!
