1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
It is everywhere reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. 
And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, so that he that committed this deed might be separated from among you. 
For I, for my part, though absent in the body, yet present in the spirit have already determined, as if I were present with you, respecting him who thus wrought this deed, 
in the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit with you are assembled together, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
to deliver such a man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. 
Your glorying is not good. Know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
Cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened; for our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ. 
So then let us keep the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
I wrote to you in that letter, not to keep company with fornicators; 
certainly not meaning the fornicators of this world, or the covetous and extortioners, or idolaters; for to do this ye must go out of the world. 
But this is what I wrote you, not to keep company with any one called a brother, if he be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one not even to eat. 
For what have I to do with judging those who are without? Do not ye judge those who are within? 
But those who are without, God will judge. Do ye put away that bad man from among yourselves.
