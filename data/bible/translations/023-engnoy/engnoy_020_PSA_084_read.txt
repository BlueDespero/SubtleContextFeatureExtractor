Psalms.
Chapter 84.
“For the leader of the music. On the Gittith. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” How lovely are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 
My soul longeth, yea, fainteth, for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh cry aloud for the living God. 
The very sparrow findeth an abode, And the swallow a nest, where they may lay their young, By thine altars, O LORD of hosts, My king and my God! 
Happy they who dwell in thy house, Who are continually praising thee! Pause. 
Happy the man whose glory is in thee, In whose heart are the ways to Jerusalem! 
Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a fountain; and the early rain covereth it with blessings. 
They go on from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion. 
Hear my prayer, O LORD, God of hosts! Give ear, O God of Jacob! Pause. 
Look down, O God! our shield, And behold the face of thine anointed! 
For a day spent in thy courts is better than a thousand: I would rather stand on the threshold of the house of my God, Than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; The LORD giveth grace and glory; No good thing doth he withhold From them that walk uprightly. 
O LORD of hosts! Happy the man who trusteth in thee!
