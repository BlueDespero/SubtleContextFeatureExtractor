The Book of Psalms.
Chapter 1.
“BOOK I” Happy the man who walketh not in the counsel of the unrighteous, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers; 
But whose delight is in the law of the LORD, And who meditateth on his precepts day and night. 
He is like a tree planted by streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaves also do not wither: All that he doeth shall prosper. 
Not so the unrighteous; They are like chaff, which the wind driveth away. 
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the just. 
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked leadeth to ruin.
