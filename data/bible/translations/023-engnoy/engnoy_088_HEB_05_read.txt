Hebrews.
Chapter 5.
For every high-priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; 
being able to be forbearing toward the ignorant and the erring, since he himself also is compassed with infirmity; 
and by reason of this infirmity he must, as for the people, so also for himself, offer sacrifice for sins. 
And no one taketh this honor to himself, but when called by God, as was Aaron. 
Thus Christ did not glorify himself to be made high-priest, but he who said to him, “Thou art my Son, I this day have begotten thee;” 
as also he saith in another place, “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.” 
Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard by reason of his godly reverence, 
though a son yet learned his obedience from what he suffered; 
and being perfected became the author of everlasting salvation to all who obey him, 
being addressed by God as high-priest after the order of Melchizedek. 
Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be explained, seeing ye have become dull of hearing. 
For while on account of the length of time ye ought to be teachers, ye again have need that some one should teach you the first elements of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food. 
For every one that feedeth on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness; for he is a babe; 
but solid food belongs to those who are of full age, who by use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
