Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise ye the LORD! Sing unto the LORD a new song; His praise in the assembly of the godly! 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; Let the sons of Zion be joyful in their king! 
Let them praise his name in the dance; Let them praise him with the timbrel and harp! 
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people; He will beautify the distressed with salvation. 
Let the godly-rejoice in their glory; Let them shout for joy upon their beds! 
Let the praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand, 
To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishment upon the peoples! 
To bind their kings with chains. And their nobles with fetters of iron; 
To execute upon them the sentence which is written: This honor have all his godly ones. Praise ye the LORD!
