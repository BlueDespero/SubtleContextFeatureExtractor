James.
Chapter 5.
Come now, ye rich men, weep and wail for your miseries that are coming upon you. 
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are become moth-eaten; 
your gold and silver is rusted, and the rust of them will be a witness against you, and will eat your flesh as fire; ye have heaped up treasure in the last days! 
Behold, the hire of the laborers who reaped your fields, which is fraudulently kept back by you, crieth out; and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts. 
Ye have lived in luxury on the earth, and have been given to pleasure; ye have pampered your hearts in a day of slaughter. 
Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just man; he doth not resist you. 
Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and is patient about it, until it hath received the early and latter rain. 
Be ye also patient, establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. 
Murmur not against each other, brethren, that ye be not judged. Behold, the Judge standeth before the door. 
Take, brethren, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, for an example of affliction, and of patience. 
Behold, we count those happy who have endured. Ye have heard of the patience of Job; behold also the end of the Lord, that he is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. 
But above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under condemnation. 
Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing praise. 
Is any sick among you? let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 
And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; even if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him. 
Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 
Elijah was a man of like nature with us, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months; 
and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. 
Brethren, if any one among you be led astray from the truth, and one convert him, 
let him know that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.
