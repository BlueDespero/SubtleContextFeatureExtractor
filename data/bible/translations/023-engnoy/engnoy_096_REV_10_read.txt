Revelation.
Chapter 10.
And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. 
And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land; 
and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. 
And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not. 
And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, lifted up his right hand to heaven, 
and swore by him who liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and the things therein, and the earth and the things therein, and the sea, and the things therein, that there should be no longer delay; 
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then should be finished the mystery of God, as he declared the glad tidings to his servants the prophets. 
And the voice which I heard out of heaven I heard again speaking to me, and saying: Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing upon the sea, and upon the land. 
And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he saith to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make thy stomach bitter, but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey. 
And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter. 
And it was said to me, Thou must again prophesy concerning many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
