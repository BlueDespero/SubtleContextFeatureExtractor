1 John.
Chapter 2.
My children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin. And if any one have sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 
And he is a propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. 
And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
But whoever keepeth his word, truly in him is the love of God perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him. 
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 
Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard. 
Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him, and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light now shineth. 
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in the darkness until now. 
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him; 
but he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. 
I write to you, my children, because your sins have been forgiven you for his name's sake. 
I write to you, fathers, because ye know him that was from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the Evil One. I have written to you, my children, because ye know the Father. 
I have written to you, fathers, because ye know him that was from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the Evil One. 
Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him; 
because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 
And the world is passing away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 
My children, the last time is come; and as ye have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now there are many antichrists; whereby we know that the last time is come. 
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they are not all of us. 
And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things. 
I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 
Who is the liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son. 
Whoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; he that acknowledgeth the Son hath also the Father. 
As for you, let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also will abide in the Son, and in the Father. 
And this is the promise which he himself promised us, even the life everlasting. 
These things I have written to you concerning those who seduce you. 
And the anointing which ye yourselves received from him abideth in you, and ye have no need that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth, and is not a lie, even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 
And now, my children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 
If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness hath been born of him.
