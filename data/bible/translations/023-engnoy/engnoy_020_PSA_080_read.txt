Psalms.
Chapter 80.
“For the leader of the music. Upon the Shushan-Eduth. A psalm of Asaph.” Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel! Thou who leadest Joseph like a flock, Thou who sittest between the cherubs, shine forth! 
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, And come and save us! 
Bring us back, O God! And cause thy face to shine, that we may be saved! 
O LORD, God of hosts! How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 
For thou causest them to eat the bread of tears, And givest them tears to drink, in full measure. 
Thou hast made us the object of strife to our neighbors, And our enemies hold us in derision. 
Bring us back, O God of hosts! And cause thy face to shine that we may be saved! 
Thou didst bring a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst expel the nations, and plant it. 
Thou didst prepare a place for it; It spread its roots, and filled the land. 
The mountains were covered with its shade, And its branches were like the cedars of God. 
It sent out its boughs to the sea, And its branches to the river. 
Why hast thou now broken down its hedges, So that all who pass by do pluck from it? 
The boar from the wood doth waste it, And the wild beast of the forest doth devour it. 
O God of hosts! return, we beseech thee, Look down from heaven, and behold, And have regard to this vine! 
Protect what thy right hand planted; The branch which thou madest strong for thyself! 
It is burnt with fire; it is cut down; Under thy rebuke they perish. 
May thy hand be over the man of thy right hand, The man whom thou madest strong for thyself! 
So will we no more turn back from thee: Revive us, and upon thy name alone will we call! 
Bring us back, O LORD, God of hosts! And cause thy face to shine, that we may he saved!
