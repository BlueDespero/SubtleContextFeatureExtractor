Psalms.
Chapter 63.
“A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.” O God! thou art my God! earnestly do I seek thee! My soul thirsteth, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry, thirsty land. where is no water! 
Thus I look toward thee in thy sanctuary, To behold thy power and thy glory! 
For thy loving-kindness is better than life; Therefore my lips shall praise thee! 
Thus will I bless thee, while I live; In thy name will I lift up my hands! 
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And with joyful lips my mouth shall praise thee, 
When I think of thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches. 
For thou art my help, And in the shadow of thy wings I rejoice. 
My soul cleaveth to thee; Thy right hand holdeth me up. 
While they who seek to destroy my life Shall themselves go down into the depths of the earth. 
They shall be given up to the sword, And be a portion for jackals. 
But the king shall rejoice in God; All that swear by him shall be honored; But the mouth of liars shall be stopped.
