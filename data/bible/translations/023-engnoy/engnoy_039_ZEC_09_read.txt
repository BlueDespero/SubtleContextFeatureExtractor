Zechariah.
Chapter 9.
The prophecy of the word of Jehovah is against the land of Hadrach, And upon Damascus shall it come down, For the eye of Jehovah is over man, And over all the tribes of Israel, 
And against Hamath, which bordereth thereon, And Tyre and Sidon, though she be very wise. 
Though Tyre hath built her a fortress, And hath heaped up silver as dust, And fine gold as the mire of the streets, 
Behold, the Lord will cast her out, And will smite her power into the sea, And she shall be devoured by fire. 
Askelon shall see it and fear, Gaza also shall see and tremble, And Ekron, because her expectation shall be put to shame. The king shall perish from Gaza, And Askelon shall not be inhabited. 
And strangers shall dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, And his abominations from between his teeth; And even he shall be left for our God, And he shall be as a governor in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite. 
And I will encamp about my house, as a garrison, Against him that passeth by and him that returneth, And no oppressor shall pass through them any more; For now have I seen with my own eyes. 
Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, Shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, thy king cometh to thee; He is just and victorious, Mild, and riding upon an ass, Even upon a colt, the foal of an ass. 
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem; And the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the nations; And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, And from the river to the ends of the earth. 
As for thee also, on account of thy blood-sealed covenant, I will set thy prisoners free from the pit wherein is no water. 
Return ye to the strong-hold, ye prisoners of hope! Even this day do I declare it: I will restore double unto thee. 
For I will bend Judah as a bow for myself; As a bow will I extend Ephraim to the utmost; And I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, Against thy sons, O Greece, And make thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
And Jehovah shall be seen over them. And his arrow shall go forth as lightning; And the Lord Jehovah shall blow the trumpet, And shall go forth with whirlwinds of the South. 
Jehovah of hosts shall defend them; And they shall devour, and trample under feet the sling-stones, And they shall drink, and shout as through wine, And they shall be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar. 
And Jehovah, their God, shall save them in that day; He will save his people as a flock; For they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifting themselves up in his land. 
How great shall be their prosperity, and how great their beauty! Corn shall make the young men thrive, and new wire the maidens.
