Job.
Chapter 16.
But Job answered and said: 
Of such things as these I have heard enough! Miserable comforters are ye all! 
Will there ever be an end to words of wind? What stirreth thee up, that thou answerest? 
I also might speak like you, If ye were now in my place; I might string together words against you, And shake my head at you. 
I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the consolation of my lips should sustain you. 
If I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And if I forbear, it doth not leave me. 
For now He hath quite exhausted me; Thou hast desolated all my house! 
Thou hast seized hold of me, and this is a witness against me; My leanness riseth up and testifieth against me to my face. 
His anger teareth my flesh, and pursueth me; He gnasheth upon me with his teeth; My adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
They gape for me with their mouths; In scorn they smite me on the cheek; With one consent they assemble against me. 
God hath given me a prey to the unrighteous, And delivered me into the hands of the wicked. 
I was at ease, but he hath crushed me; He hath seized me by the neck, and dashed me in pieces; He hath set me up for his mark. 
His archers encompass me around; He pierceth my reins, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He rusheth upon me like a warrior. 
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And thrust my horn into the dust. 
My face is red with weeping, And upon my eyelids is deathlike darkness. 
Yet is there no injustice in my bands. And my prayer hath been pure. 
O earth! cover not thou my blood, And let there be no hiding-place for my cry! 
Yet even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he who knoweth me is on high. 
My friends have me in derision, But my eye poureth out tears unto God. 
O that one might contend for a man with God, As a man contendeth with his neighbor! 
For when a few years shall have passed, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
