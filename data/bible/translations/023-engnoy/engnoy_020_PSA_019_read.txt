Psalms.
Chapter 19.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” The heavens declare the glory of God; The firmament showeth forth the work of his hands. 
Day uttereth instruction unto day, And night showeth knowledge unto night. 
They have no speech nor language, And their voice is not heard; 
Yet their sound goeth forth to all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 
Which cometh forth like a bridegroom from his chamber, And rejoiceth, like a strong man, to run his course. 
He goeth forth from the extremity of heaven, And maketh his circuit to the end of it; And nothing is hid from his heat. 
The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; The precepts of the LORD are sure, making wise the simple; 
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandments of the LORD are pure, enlightening the eyes; 
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 
More precious are they than gold; yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. 
By them also is thy servant warned, And in keeping of them there is great reward. 
Who knoweth his own offences? Oh, cleanse thou me from secret faults! 
Keep back also thy servant from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me! Then shall I be upright; I shall not be polluted with gross transgression. 
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer!
