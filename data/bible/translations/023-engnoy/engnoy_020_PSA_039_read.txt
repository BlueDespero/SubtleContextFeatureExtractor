Psalms.
Chapter 39.
“A psalm of David. For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites.” I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I may not sin with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me. 
I was dumb with silence; I spake not even what was good; But my pain was increased. 
My heart was hot within me; In my anguish the fire burst forth, And I spake with my tongue: 
LORD, make me to know mine end, And the number of my days, That I may know how frail I am! 
Behold, thou hast made my days as a hand-breadth, And my life is as nothing before thee; Yea, every man in his firmest state is altogether vanity. Pause. 
Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely he disquieteth himself in vain; He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. 
What, then, O Lord! is my hope? My hope is in thee! 
Deliver me from all my transgressions; Let me not be the reproach of scoffers! 
Yet I am dumb; I open not my mouth; For thou hast done it! 
But remove from me thine infliction; For I am perishing by the blow of thine hand. 
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for iniquity, Thou causest his glory to waste away like a moth! Surely every man is vanity. 
Hear my prayer, O LORD! Give ear to my cry; Be not silent at my tears! For I am but a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were. 
O spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go away, and be no more!
