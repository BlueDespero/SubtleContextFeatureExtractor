Zechariah.
Chapter 5.
And I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, a flying roll. 
And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 
Then said he to me:— This is the curse that goeth forth Over the Face of the whole land; For every one who stealeth shall be cut off from hence, according to it, And every one who sweareth falsely shall be cut off from hence, according to it. 
I will bring it forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, And it shall enter into the house of the thief, And into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; And it shall abide in his house, And shall consume it, with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. 
Then the angel who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what this is which goeth forth. 
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah which goeth forth. He said, moreover, This is their image through all the land. 
And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up, and a woman was sitting upon the ephah. 
And he said, This is the Wickedness. And he cast her into the ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and behold, there came forth two women, and wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and heaven. 
Then said I to the angel who talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
And he said to me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar, that it may be fixed there, and set upon its base.
