Ezekiel.
Chapter 41.
Afterwards he brought me to the temple; and he measured the projecting wall-pillars, six cubits broad on this side, and six cubits broad on that side, according to the breadth of the house. 
And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on this side; and five cubits on that side. Then he measured the length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. 
And he went inward, and measured the border of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. 
Then he measured twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth in the temple, and said to me, This is the most holy place. 
And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits round about, round about the house: 
And the side-chambers were chamber to chamber, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall of the house of the side-chambers round about, and were connected with it; but they were not connected with the wall of the house. 
And, the side-chambers became wider upward, having a winding ascent. For the circuit of the house went still upward, round about the house; therefore the greater breadth of the house was upward; and so they ascended from the lowest story to the highest through the middle story. 
I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed, six cubits to the knuckles. 
The thickness of the wall of the side-chambers outward was five cubits, and the space which was left was the place of the side-chambers of the house. 
And between the rooms was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the space that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space that was left was five cubits round about. 
And the building which was before the separate place, at the side toward the west, was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof was ninety cubits. 
Then he measured the length of the house, a hundred cubits; and the length of the separate place and the building and the walls thereof, a hundred cubits. 
Also the breadth towards the front of the house and of the separate place toward the east was a hundred cubits. 
And he measured the length of the building before the separate place, and that which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on this side and on that side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court, 
the thresholds, and the windows that were closed, and the galleries round about the three sides. Over against the threshold was a table of wood round about, from the ground to the windows, and the windows were covered with it; 
upon the space above every door, and upon the inner house, and without, and upon all the wall round about within and without, according to measure. 
And cherubs and palm-trees were made, one palm-tree between two cherubs, and every cherub had two faces; 
and the face of a man was toward a palm-tree on one side, and the face of a lion toward a palm-tree on the other side. So was it made upon all the house round about. 
From the ground to above the door were cherubs and palm-trees made, and on the wall of the temple. 
The posts of the temple were four-square; and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance. 
The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and two cubits long; and the corners thereof and the base thereof and the walls thereof were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that standeth before Jehovah. 
And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
And the two doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for one door, and two leaves for the other door. 
And there were made on them, even on the doors of the temple, cherubs and palm-trees, such as were made upon the walls, and a wooden threshold was before the porch without. 
And at the closed windows were palm-trees on this side, and on that side, on the sides of the porch, and on the side-chambers of the house, and on the thresholds.
