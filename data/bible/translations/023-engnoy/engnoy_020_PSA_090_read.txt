Psalms.
Chapter 90.
“BOOK IV. A prayer of Moses, the man of God.” LORD! thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations! 
Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God! 
But man thou turnest again to dust, And sayst, “Return, ye children of men!” 
For a thousand years are, in thy sight, As yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night. 
Thou carriest him away as with a flood; He is a dream; In the morning he springeth up like grass, 
Which flourisheth and shooteth up in the morning, And in the evening is cut down, and withered. 
For we are consumed by thine anger, And by thy wrath are we destroyed. 
Thou settest our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 
By reason of thine anger all our days vanish away; We spend our years like a thought. 
The days of our life are threescore years and ten, And, by reason of strength, may be fourscore years: Yet is the pride of them weariness and sorrow; For it vanisheth swiftly, and we fly away. 
Yet who attendeth to the power of thine anger? Who with due reverence regardeth thine indignation? 
Teach us so to number our days, That we may apply our hearts to wisdom! 
Desist, O LORD! How long—? Have compassion upon thy servants! 
Satisfy us speedily with thy mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days! 
Make us glad according to the time in which thou hast afflicted us; According to the years in which we have seen adversity! 
Let thy deeds be known to thy servants, And thy glory to their children! 
Let the favor of the LORD our God be upon us, And establish for us the work of our hands; Yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it!
