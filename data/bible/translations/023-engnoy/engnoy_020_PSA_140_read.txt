Psalms.
Chapter 140.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” Deliver me, O LORD! from the evil man, Save me from the man of violence, 
Who meditate mischief in their heart, And daily stir up war! 
They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of the adder is under their lips. Pause. 
Defend me, O LORD! from the hands of the wicked, Preserve me from the man of violence, Who have purposed to cause my fall! Pause. 
The proud have hidden snares and cords for me; They have spread a net by the way-side; They have set traps for me. 
I say to Jehovah, Thou art my God; Hear, O Jehovah! the voice of my supplication! 
The Lord Jehovah is my saving strength: Thou shelterest my head in the day of battle! 
Grant not, O LORD! the desires of the wicked; Let not their devices prosper; Let them not exalt themselves! 
As for the heads of those who encompass me, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them! 
Let burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, And into deep waters from which they shall not arise! 
The slanderer shall not be established upon the earth; Evil shall pursue the violent man to destruction. 
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And the right of the poor. 
Yea, the righteous shall praise thy name; The upright shall dwell in thy presence!
