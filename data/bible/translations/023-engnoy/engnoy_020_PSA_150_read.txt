Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Praise ye the LORD! Praise God in his sanctuary! Praise him in his glorious firmament! 
Praise him for his mighty deeds! Praise him according to his excellent greatness! 
Praise him with the sound of trumpets! Praise him with the psaltery and harp! 
Praise him with the timbrel and dance! Praise him with stringed instruments and pipes! 
Praise him with the clear-sounding cymbals! Praise him with the high-sounding cymbals! 
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD! Praise ye the LORD!
