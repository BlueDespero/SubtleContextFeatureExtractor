Psalms.
Chapter 139.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” O LORD! thou hast searched me and known me! 
Thou knowest my sitting-down and my rising-up; Thou understandest my thoughts from afar! 
Thou seest my path and my lying-down, And art acquainted with all my ways! 
For before the word is upon my tongue, Behold, O LORD! thou knowest it altogether! 
Thou besettest me behind and before, And layest thine hand upon me! 
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain to it! 
Whither shall I go from thy spirit, And whither shall I flee from thy presence? 
If I ascend into heaven, thou art there! If I make my bed in the underworld, behold, thou art there! 
If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the remotest parts of the sea, 
Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me! 
If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me;” Even the night shall be light about me. 
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day; The darkness and the light are both alike to thee! 
For thou didst form my reins; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb. 
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvellous are thy works, And this my soul knoweth full well! 
My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret. When I was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth. 
Thine eyes did see my substance, while yet unformed, And in thy book was every thing written; My days were appointed before one of them existed. 
How precious to me are thy thoughts, O God! How great is the sum of them! 
If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee! 
O that thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God! Ye men of blood, depart from me! 
For they speak against thee wickedly; Thine enemies utter thy name for falsehood. 
Do I not hate them that hate thee, O LORD? Do I not abhor them that rise up against thee? 
Yea, I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies. 
Search me, O God! and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts; 
And see if the way of trouble be within me, And lead me in the way everlasting!
