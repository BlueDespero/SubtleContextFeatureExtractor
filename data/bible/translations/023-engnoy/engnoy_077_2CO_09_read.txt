2 Corinthians.
Chapter 9.
For concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you. 
For I know your readiness of mind, of which I boast in behalf of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared a year ago; and your zeal stirred up the greater part of them. 
But I sent the brethren, that our boasting of you should not prove unfounded in this respect; that, as I said, ye may be prepared; 
lest, should the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be put to shame in respect to this confidence. 
I thought it necessary therefore to exhort the brethren to go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, which was already announced, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not of covetousness. 
But this there is to say: He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. 
Each one, as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver. 
And God is able to make every blessing abound toward you, that ye, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work; 
as it is written: “He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for ever.” 
Now, he that ministereth seed to the sower, and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness; 
while ye are enriched in everything to all liberality, which worketh out through us thanksgiving to God; 
for the ministration of this service not only supplieth the wants of the saints, but also overfloweth through many thanksgivings to God; 
while by the proof afforded by this ministration they glorify God for your obedience to your profession in regard to the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution in regard to them and in regard to all; 
while with supplication for you they long after you on account of the exceeding grace of God to you. 
Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
