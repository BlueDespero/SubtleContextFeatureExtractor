Psalms.
Chapter 28.
“A psalm of David.” To thee do I cry, O LORD! O my rock! be not silent to me, Lest, if thou answer me not, I become like those who go down to the pit! 
Hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands to thy most holy sanctuary! 
Draw me not away with the impious, and with evil-doers, Who speak peace to their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts! 
Give them according to their deeds, and the wickedness of their doings; Give them according to the work of their hands; Render to them their desert! 
For they regard not the doings of the LORD, nor the work of his hands; Therefore will he destroy them, and not again build them up. 
Praised be the LORD, for he hath heard the voice of my supplications! 
The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusteth in him, and he helpeth me; Therefore doth my heart exult, And in my song I will praise him. 
Jehovah is the strength of his people; He is the protecting shield of his anointed. 
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; Feed them also, and build them up for ever!
