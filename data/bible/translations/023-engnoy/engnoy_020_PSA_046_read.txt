Psalms.
Chapter 46.
“For the leader of the music. Of, or for, the sons of Korah. To be sung in the manner, or with the voice, of virgins.” God is our refuge and strength; An ever present help in trouble. 
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be changed; Though the mountains tremble in the heart of the sea; 
Though its waters roar and be troubled, And the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Pause. 
A river with its streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling-place of the Most High. 
God is the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her, and that full early. 
The nations raged; kingdoms were moved; He uttered his voice, the earth melted. 
The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Pause. 
Come, behold the doings of the LORD; What desolations he hath made in the earth! 
He causeth wars to cease to the end of the earth; He hath broken the bow, and snapped the spear asunder, And burned the chariots in fire. 
“Desist, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted throughout the earth!” 
The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge.
