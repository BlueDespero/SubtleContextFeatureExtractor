Mark.
Chapter 15.
And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests, having held a consultation with the elders and the scribes, and the whole council, bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. 
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering saith to him, I am. 
And the chief priests brought many charges against him. 
And Pilate asked him again, Dost thou make no answer? See what things they are testifying against thee! 
But Jesus made no further answer; so that Pilate marveled. 
Now at the feast he was wont to release to them one prisoner, whom they might ask. 
And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with insurgents who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
And the multitude, coming up, began to ask him to do as he had been wont to do for them. 
And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the king of the Jews? 
For he knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. 
But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release to them Barabbas. 
And Pilate answering again said to them, What then would ye have me do with him whom ye call the king of the Jews? 
And they cried out again, Crucify him! 
Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more, Crucify him! 
And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the multitude, released to them Barabbas; and, when he had scourged Jesus, delivered him up to be crucified. 
And the soldiers led him away into the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 
And they clothe him with purple, and having platted a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 
And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews! 
And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and kneeling down, did him homage. 
And after they had made sport of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, and put his own garments on him. And they lead him out to crucify him. 
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenaean, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 
And they bring him to the place Golgotha; which is, when interpreted, Place of a Skull. 
And they gave him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it. 
And they crucify him, and divide his garments, casting lots for them, what each should take. 
And it was the third hour when they crucified him. 
And on the cross the inscription of the charge against him was written: “The king of the Jews.” 
And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. 
And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it up in three days, 
save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes, making sport among themselves, said, He saved others, cannot he save himself? 
Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him were reviling him. 
And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which is, when interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, See! he is calling for Elijah. 
And one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Hold! Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down. 
And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired. 
And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. 
And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that he so expired, said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
There were also women looking on from a distance; among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 
who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and rendered him their services; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. 
And evening having now come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable councilor, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, came, and boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. 
And Pilate wondered that he was already dead; and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been long dead. 
And having been informed by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
And having bought fine linen, he took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a tomb which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb. 
And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
