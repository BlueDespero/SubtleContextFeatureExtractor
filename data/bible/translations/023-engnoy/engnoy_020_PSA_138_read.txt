Psalms.
Chapter 138.
“A psalm of David.” I will praise thee with my whole heart; Before the gods will I sing praise to thee; 
I will worship toward thy holy temple, And praise thy name for thy goodness and thy truth; For thy promise thou hast magnified above all thy name! 
In the day when I called, thou didst hear me; Thou didst strengthen me, and encourage my soul. 
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD! When they hear the promises of thy mouth! 
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD; For great is the glory of the LORD. 
The LORD is high, yet he looketh upon the humble, And the proud doth he know from afar. 
Though I walk through the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies; Thou wilt save me by thy right hand! 
The LORD will perform all things for me; Thy goodness, O LORD! endureth ever: Forsake not the works of thine hands!
