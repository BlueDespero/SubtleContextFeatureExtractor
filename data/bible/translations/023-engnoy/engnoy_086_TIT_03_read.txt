Titus.
Chapter 3.
Put them in mind to submit themselves to governments, to authorities, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work, 
to speak evil of no one, to be averse to strife, forbearing, showing all meekness to all men. 
For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, going astray, slaves to divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. 
But when the kindness and love for men of God our Saviour appeared, 
not by works of righteousness which we did, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the bath of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 
which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, 
that having been accepted as righteous by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of everlasting life. 
True is the saying; and these things I desire that thou affirm earnestly, that they who have believed in God may be careful to practise good works. These things are good and profitable to men; 
but avoid foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and contentions about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
A man that stirs up divisions, after a first and second admonition, avoid; 
knowing that he that is such is utterly perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned. 
When I shall have sent Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, use diligence to come to me to Nicopolis; for there I have determined to pass the winter. 
Zenas the lawyer and Apollos forward on their journey diligently, that nothing may be wanting to them. 
And let those also who belong to us learn to practise good works for the necessary wants that arise, that they may not be unfruitful. 
All that are with me salute thee. Salute those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
