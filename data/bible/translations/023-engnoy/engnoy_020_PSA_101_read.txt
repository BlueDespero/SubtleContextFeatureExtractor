Psalms.
Chapter 101.
“A psalm of David.” I will sing of mercy and justice; To thee, O LORD! will I sing! 
I will have regard to the way of uprightness: When thou shalt come to me, I will walk within my house with an upright heart. 
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; I hate the work of evil-doers; It shall not cleave to me. 
The perverse in heart shall be far from me; I will not know a wicked person. 
Whoso slandereth his neighbor in secret, him will I cut off; Him that hath a haughty look and a proud heart I will not endure. 
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; He that walketh in the way of uprightness shall serve me. 
He who practiseth deceit shall not dwell in my house; He who telleth lies shall not remain in my sight. 
Every morning will I destroy the wicked of the land, That I may cut off all evil-doers from the city of the LORD.
