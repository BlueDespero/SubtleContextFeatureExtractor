Psalms.
Chapter 147.
Praise ye the LORD! For it is good to sing praise to our God; For it is pleasant, and praise is becoming. 
The LORD buildeth up Jerusalem; He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel. 
He healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds. 
He counteth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by their names. 
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite. 
The LORD lifteth up the lowly; He casteth the wicked down to the ground. 
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; Sing praises upon the harp to our God! 
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who causeth grass to grow upon the mountains. 
He giveth to the cattle their food. And to the young ravens, when they cry. 
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse, He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. 
The LORD taketh pleasure in those who fear him, In those who trust in his mercy. 
Praise the LORD. O Jerusalem! Praise thy God, O Zion! 
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee. 
He maketh peace in thy borders, And satisfieth thee with the finest of the wheat. 
He sendeth forth his command to the earth; His word runneth very swiftly. 
He giveth snow like wool, And scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. 
He casteth forth his ice like morsels; Who can stand before his cold? 
He sendeth forth his word, and melteth them; He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 
He publisheth his word to Jacob, His statutes and laws to Israel. 
He hath dealt in this manner with no other nation; And, as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD!
