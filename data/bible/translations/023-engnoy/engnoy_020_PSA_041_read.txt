Psalms.
Chapter 41.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” Happy is he who hath regard to the poor! The LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. 
The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; He shall be happy on the earth; Thou wilt not give him up to the will of his enemies! 
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of disease; All his bed thou wilt change in his sickness. 
I said, O LORD! be merciful to me! Heal me, for I have sinned against thee! 
My enemies speak evil of me: “When will he die, and his name perish?” 
If one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth malice; When he goeth abroad, he uttereth it. 
All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise mischief: 
“A deadly disease cleaveth fast unto him; He lieth down, and he shall never arise!” 
Yea, my familiar friend in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread,—He hath lifted up his heel against me. 
But do thou, O LORD! have pity upon me; Raise me up, that I may requite them! 
By this I know that thou favorest me, Because my enemy doth not triumph over me. 
As for me, thou wilt uphold me in my integrity; Thou wilt set me before thy face for ever! 
Praised be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting. Amen! Amen!
