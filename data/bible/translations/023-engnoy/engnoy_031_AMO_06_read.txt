Amos.
Chapter 6.
Woe to them that dwell at ease in Zion; That feel secure upon the mountain of Samaria; The honorable men of the chief of the nations, To whom the house of Israel resort! 
Pass over to Calneh, and see; And thence go to great Hamath; Then go down to Gath of the Philistines: Are they better than these kingdoms, Or is their border greater than your border? 
Woe to them, that put far away the day of evil, And bring near the seat of oppression; 
That lie upon beds of ivory, And stretch themselves upon their couches; That eat lambs from the flock, And calves from the stall; 
That chant to the sound of the harp, And invent for themselves instruments of music, like David; 
That drink wine in bowls, And anoint themselves with the most precious perfumes, But grieve not for the destruction of Joseph! 
Therefore now shall they go captive at the head of the captives; Yea, the shouting of them that stretch themselves upon their couches shall cease. 
The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, And I hate his palaces; I will give up the city, and all that is therein. 
And if ten men remain in one house, These also shall die. 
A man's relative, or a burner of the dead, shall take him up, To carry his bones out of the house, And he shall say to him that is in the innermost part of the house, Is there yet any one with thee? And he shall answer, No one! Then shall he say, Keep silence! For we may not make mention of the name of Jehovah. 
For behold Jehovah hath commanded, And he will smite the great house with breaches, And the small house with clefts. 
Shall horses run upon rocks, Or will one plough rocks with oxen, That ye change justice into hemlock, And the fruit of equity into wormwood, 
Ye that rejoice in a thing of naught, And say, Have we not acquired dominion by our own strength? 
Behold, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, I will raise against you a nation, That shall oppress you from Hamath Even to the brook of the desert.
