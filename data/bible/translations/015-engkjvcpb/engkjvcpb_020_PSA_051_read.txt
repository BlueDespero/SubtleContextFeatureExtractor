Psalms.
Chapter 51.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. 
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. 
For I acknowledge my transgressions: And my sin is ever before me. 
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And done this evil in thy sight: That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, And be clear when thou judgest. 
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; And in sin did my mother conceive me. 
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: And in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
Make me to hear joy and gladness; That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 
Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit within me. 
Cast me not away from thy presence; And take not thy holy Spirit from me. 
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; And uphold me with thy free spirit. 
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; And sinners shall be converted unto thee. 
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
O Lord, open thou my lips; And my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. 
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: Thou delightest not in burnt offering. 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
