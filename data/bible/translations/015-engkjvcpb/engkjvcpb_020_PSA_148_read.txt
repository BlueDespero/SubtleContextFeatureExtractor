Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: Praise him in the heights. 
Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his hosts. 
Praise ye him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light. 
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that be above the heavens. 
Let them praise the name of the Lord: For he commanded, and they were created. 
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass. 
Praise the Lord from the earth, Ye dragons, and all deeps: 
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; Stormy wind fulfilling his word: 
Mountains, and all hills; Fruitful trees, and all cedars: 
Beasts, and all cattle; Creeping things, and flying fowl: 
Kings of the earth, and all people; Princes, and all judges of the earth: 
Both young men, and maidens; Old men, and children: 
Let them praise the name of the Lord: For his name alone is excellent; His glory is above the earth and heaven. 
He also exalteth the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.
