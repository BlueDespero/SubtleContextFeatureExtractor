Psalms.
Chapter 24.
A Psalm of David. The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein. 
For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods. 
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place? 
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lift up his soul unto vanity, Nor sworn deceitfully. 
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, And righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
This is the generation of them that seek him, That seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; And the King of glory shall come in. 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle. 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; And the King of glory shall come in. 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
