Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A Song of degrees. Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; That walketh in his ways. 
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine By the sides of thine house: Thy children like olive plants Round about thy table. 
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord. 
The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: And thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem All the days of thy life. 
Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, And peace upon Israel.
