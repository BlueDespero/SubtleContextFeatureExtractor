Psalms.
Chapter 60.
To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, Thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 
That thy beloved may be delivered; Save with thy right hand, and hear me. 
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, And mete out the valley of Succoth. 
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
Moab is my washpot; Over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? And thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 
Give us help from trouble: For vain is the help of man. 
Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
