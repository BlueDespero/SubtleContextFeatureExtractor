Psalms.
Chapter 99.
The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: He sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 
The Lord is great in Zion; And he is high above all the people. 
Let them praise thy great and terrible name; For it is holy. 
The king’s strength also loveth judgment; Thou dost establish equity, Thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 
Exalt ye the Lord our God, And worship at his footstool; For he is holy. 
Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon the Lord, and he answered them. 
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: They kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 
Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at his holy hill; For the Lord our God is holy.
