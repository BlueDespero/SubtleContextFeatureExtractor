Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A Song of degrees. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. 
Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared. 
I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope. 
My soul waiteth for the Lord More than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord: For with the Lord there is mercy, And with him is plenteous redemption. 
And he shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
