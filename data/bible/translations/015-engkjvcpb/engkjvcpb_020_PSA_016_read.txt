Psalms.
Chapter 16.
Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: My goodness extendeth not to thee; 
But to the saints that are in the earth, And to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. 
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take up their names into my lips. 
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot. 
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage. 
I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: My reins also instruct me in the night seasons. 
I have set the Lord always before me: Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: My flesh also shall rest in hope. 
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: In thy presence is fulness of joy; At thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
