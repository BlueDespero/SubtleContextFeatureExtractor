Psalms.
Chapter 138.
A Psalm of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: Before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. 
I will worship towards thy holy temple, And praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, And strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. 
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, When they hear the words of thy mouth. 
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: For great is the glory of the Lord. 
Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: But the proud he knoweth afar off. 
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, And thy right hand shall save me. 
The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: Forsake not the works of thine own hands.
