Isaiah.
Chapter 62.
For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, Until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, And the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. 
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, And all kings thy glory: And thou shalt be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the Lord shall name. 
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, And a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; Neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: But thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, And thy land Beulah: For the Lord delighteth in thee, And thy land shall be married. 
For as a young man marrieth a virgin, So shall thy sons marry thee: And as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, So shall thy God rejoice over thee. 
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, Which shall never hold their peace day nor night: Ye that make mention of the Lord, Keep not silence, 
and give him no rest, Till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; And the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured: 
But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; And they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. 
Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people; Cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; Lift up a standard for the people. 
Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, his reward is with him, And his work before him. 
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord: And thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
