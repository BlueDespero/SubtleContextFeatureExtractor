Hosea.
Chapter 5.
Hear ye this, O priests; And hearken, ye house of Israel; And give ye ear, O house of the king; For judgment is toward you, Because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, And a net spread upon Tabor. 
And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, Though I have been a rebuker of them all. 
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: For now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled. 
They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: For the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, And they have not known the Lord. 
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. 
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord; But they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them. 
They have dealt treacherously against the Lord: For they have begotten strange children: Now shall a month devour them with their portions. 
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, And the trumpet in Ramah: Cry aloud at Beth-aven, After thee, O Benjamin. 
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: Among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: Therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, Because he willingly walked after the commandment. 
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, And to the house of Judah as rottenness. 
When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah saw his wound, Then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, And sent to king Jareb: Yet could he not heal you, Nor cure you of your wound. 
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, And as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him. 
I will go and return to my place, Till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: In their affliction they will seek me early.
