Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. 
While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 
Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish. 
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in the Lord his God: 
Which made heaven, and earth, The sea, and all that therein is: Which keepeth truth for ever: 
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: Which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners: 
The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: The Lord loveth the righteous: 
The Lord preserveth the strangers; He relieveth the fatherless and widow: But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 
The Lord shall reign for ever, Even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.
