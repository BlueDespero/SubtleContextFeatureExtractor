Psalms.
Chapter 57.
To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: For my soul trusteth in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, Until these calamities be overpast. 
I will cry unto God most High; Unto God that performeth all things for me. 
He shall send from heaven, and save me From the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 
My soul is among lions: And I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let thy glory be above all the earth. 
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me, Into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah. 
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. 
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations. 
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the clouds. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: Let thy glory be above all the earth.
