Colossians.
Chapter 4.
Masters, provide your slaves with what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in the heavens. 
Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving, 
at the same time praying for us, that God may open to us a door for the Word, to speak the mystery of Christ (for which I am also in chains), 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
Behave wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 
Let your word always be with grace, seasoned with salt, to know how you ought to answer each one. 
Tychicus will tell you all the news about me; he is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord. 
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and encourage your hearts, 
with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you; they will tell you everything that is happening here. 
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him), 
and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have been a comfort to me. 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ, greets you; he is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 
I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis. 
Luke the beloved physician greets you, also Demas. 
Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the congregation at his house. 
Now when this letter has been read among you, see that it is also read in the Laodicean congregation, and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea. 
And say to Archippus, “See to it that you complete the work that you received in the Lord.” 
This greeting is in my own hand: Paul. Remember my chains. The Grace be with you. Amen.
