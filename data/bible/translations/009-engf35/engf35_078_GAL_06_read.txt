Galatians.
Chapter 6.
Brothers, if a man is actually caught in some wrongdoing, you, the spiritual ones, should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, watching out for yourself lest you also be tempted. 
Bear one another's heavy burdens, and so fulfill the law of the Christ. 
For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
Let each one test his own work, and then do his ‘boasting’ only within himself, never to someone else. 
For each one must carry his own normal load. 
Let him who is taught the Word share all good things with him who teaches. 
Do not be deceived, God does not allow Himself to be treated with contempt; because whatever a man sows, that he will also reap 
—he who sows to his own flesh will reap deterioration from that flesh; he who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from that Spirit. 
Let us not lose heart while doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we do not give up. 
So then, as we have opportunity, let us do what is good toward everyone, but especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. 
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand. 
Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh are pressuring you to be circumcised, but only so as not to be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
For not even those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 
But as for me, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
Because in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation. 
Now as for those who conform to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. 
Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the brand marks of the Lord Jesus. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
