The Second Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians in God our Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ: 
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ. 
We are obligated to always give thanks to God about you, brothers, and properly so, because your faith is really growing, and the love of each and every one of you towards each other keeps increasing; 
so that we ourselves boast about you among God's congregations, referring to your steadfastness and faith in the midst of all your persecutions, and the tribulations that you are enduring 
—the above is evidence that God's judgment is right, to the end that you be considered worthy of the Kingdom of God, on behalf of which you are actually suffering; 
since to God it is right to pay back affliction to those who are afflicting you 
and rest (along with us) to you who are being afflicted, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with His powerful angels in blazing fire, 
inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who will pay a penalty: everlasting ruin, away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of His might, 
whenever He comes to be glorified by His saints, yes to be marveled at by all who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed); in that Day. 
To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling and fulfill with power every desire of usefulness and work of faith, 
so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.
