Titus.
Chapter 2.
Now you, speak the things that suit sound doctrine: 
older men are to be sober, dignified, prudent, sound in the faith, in love and in endurance; 
similarly older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good 
—so that they may instruct the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
to be prudent, pure, good homemakers, subordinating themselves to their own husbands, so that the Word of God not be maligned. 
Similarly, exhort the young men to be self-controlled, 
in all things presenting yourself as an example of good works: showing integrity, dignity and incorruptibility in your teaching 
—healthy speech, beyond reproach—so that the opponent may be put to shame, having nothing slighting to say about us. 
Exhort slaves to subordinate themselves to their own owners, to be well pleasing in all things, not talking back, 
not pilfering but showing total trustworthiness, so as to adorn the doctrine of our Savior God in everything. 
For the saving grace of God has appeared for all men, 
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live prudently, righteously and godly in this present age, 
looking for the blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
who gave Himself for us, so that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for Himself a special people, zealous for good works. 
Speak these things, whether you exhort or reprove, with all authority. Let no one disdain you.
