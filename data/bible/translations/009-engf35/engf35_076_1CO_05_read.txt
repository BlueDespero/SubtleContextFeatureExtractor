1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as not even pagans talk about—that someone has his father's wife! 
And you are puffed up and not even grieved, so as to exclude the one who has done this deed from your fellowship. 
For I indeed, as present in spirit though absent in body, have already judged the one who created this situation, as though I were present: 
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you and my spirit being together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
we must hand such a one over to Satan for a destruction of the ‘flesh’, that the spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus. 
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? 
Therefore purge out the old leaven, so that you can be a new batch, like you are, without yeast. Especially since Christ our Passover has been sacrificed in our place. 
So then let us observe the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened loaves of sincerity and truth. 
I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with fornicators— 
not of course the fornicators of this world, or the greedy, or the swindlers, or the idolaters; since then you would have to exit the world! 
But now I write you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a brother who is a fornicator, or greedy, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such. 
Now just why should it be up to me to judge those who are outside? Will you not judge those who are inside? 
Those who are outside God will judge, and you must exclude the wicked one from among you.
