1 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
Here is a trustworthy word: if a man aspires to the position of overseer, he desires a good work. 
Now then, it is obligatory for the overseer to be above reproach, a one woman man, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, good at teaching, 
not a drinker, not a bully, not corrupt financially, but gentle, peaceful, not greedy; 
one who rules his own house well, having children who obey him with due respect 
(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how can he take care of God's congregation?); 
not a recent convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same judgment that the devil did. 
Also, it is necessary for him to have a good reputation with those who are outside the congregation, so as not to fall into reproach and the devil's snare. 
Similarly, deacons must be respectable, not deceitful, not heavy drinkers, not corrupt financially; 
holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 
But let these also first be tested; then, if they are blameless, let them serve as deacons. 
Similarly, women must be respectable, not slanderers, temperate, trustworthy in everything. 
Let deacons be one woman men, ruling their children and their own houses well. 
For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and considerable confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
Although I hope to come to you shortly, I am writing these things to you 
in case I am delayed, so that you may know how it is necessary to conduct oneself in God's household, which is the Church of the living God, pillar and foundation of the truth. 
Yes, the mystery of our religion is confessedly great: God was manifested in flesh, was vindicated in spirit, was revealed to angels, was proclaimed among nations, was believed in the world, was received up in glory!
