Acts.
Chapter 6.
Now in those days, as the disciples were multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution. 
So summoning the multitude of the disciples the twelve said: “It is not advantageous that we should forsake the Word of God to serve at tables. 
Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need. 
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.” 
The statement pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicholas, a proselyte from Antioch, 
whom they set before the Apostles; and after praying they laid hands on them. 
Well the Word of God kept spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem kept multiplying at a great rate, and a large company of the priests were obeying the faith. 
While Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. 
Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen. 
And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. 
Then they instigated men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.” 
And they stirred up the people, and the elders and the scribes; and coming upon him they seized him, and brought him in to the Sanhedrin; 
and they put forward false witnesses who said: “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against the holy place and the law; 
for we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Natsorean will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses delivered to us.” 
All who sat in the council, looking intently at him, saw his face like the face of an angel.
