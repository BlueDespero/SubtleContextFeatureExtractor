The First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the congregation of Thessalonians in God the Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and Sovereign Jesus Christ. 
We always give thanks to God for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers, 
continually remembering before our God and Father your work for the Faith and your labor coming from the Love and your perseverance based on the Hope, our Lord Jesus Christ being their source, 
knowing as we do, brothers loved by God, that you are chosen. 
You see, our Gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with complete certainty (of course you know what sort of men we proved to be among you for your sake). 
Yes you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the Word with the Holy Spirit's joy, in spite of severe affliction, 
so that you became examples to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 
That is because the Word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia but also in every place—your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we do not need to say anything. 
They themselves report about you what kind of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to be slaves to the living and true God, 
and to wait for His Son coming out of the heavens (whom He raised from among the dead)—Jesus, who preserves us from the coming wrath.
