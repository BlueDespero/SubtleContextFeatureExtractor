James.
Chapter 4.
Where do the wars and disputes among you come from? Is it not precisely from your pleasures, the ones at war in your members? 
You crave and do not have; you murder and covet and are not able to obtain; you fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask. 
You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so that you may lavish it on your pleasures. 
Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? So whoever may want to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
Or do you suppose that the Scripture says in vain that the Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously? 
But He gives greater grace; therefore He says: “God resists proud ones, but gives grace to humble ones.” 
Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Sinners, cleanse your hands! Double-minded, purify your hearts! 
Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into dejection. 
Humble yourself before the Lord and He will exalt you. 
Brothers, do not speak evil of one another. Because the one speaking against a brother and judging his brother speaks against a law and judges a law. So if you judge a law you are not a law-doer but a judge. 
The Lawgiver and Judge is One, the one who is able to save and to destroy. So who are you (sg) to be judging someone who is different? 
Come now, you who say, “Today and tomorrow let us travel to that certain city, spend a year there, do business and make a profit;” 
whereas you do not know anything about the morrow. For what is our life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time but then vanishes away. 
Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” 
But now you boast in your arrogant pretensions. All such boasting is malignant. 
Therefore, to the one knowing to do good and not doing it, to him it is sin.
