Chapter 61.
For the music director. With stringed instruments. A psalm of David. God, please hear my cry for help; please listen to my prayer. 
From this distant place, far from home, I cry out to you as my courage fails. Take me to a rock high above me where I will be safe, 
for you are my protection, a strong tower where my enemies cannot attack me. 
Let me live with you forever; protect me under the shelter of your wings. Selah. 
For you, God, have heard the promises I've made. You have given all those who love your character your special blessing. 
Please give the king many extra years; may his reign last through generations. 
May he always live in your presence; may your trustworthy love and faithfulness protect him. 
Then I will always sing praises to you, and every day I will keep my promises to you.
