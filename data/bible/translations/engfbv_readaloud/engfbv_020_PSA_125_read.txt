Chapter 125.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, for it is unshakeable and endures forever. 
In the same way that the mountains surround Jerusalem, the Lord surrounds his people, now and forever. 
The wicked will not always rule over the land of the faithful, otherwise the faithful might also end up doing wrong. 
Lord, please do good to those who do good, those who sincerely do what is right. 
But as for those who turn aside to follow their own crooked ways—those the Lord will lead them away together with those who do evil. May Israel be at peace!
