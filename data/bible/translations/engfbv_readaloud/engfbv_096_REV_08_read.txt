Revelation.
Chapter 8.
When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for around half an hour. 
I saw the seven angels that stand before God. They were given seven trumpets. 
Then another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a golden censer and he was given a large quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that stands in front of the throne. 
The smoke of the incense rose together with the prayers of the saints before God from the hand of the angel. 
The angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down upon the earth; there was the sound of thunder, with lightning flashes, and a terrible earthquake. 
Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. 
The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood rained down on the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, one third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up. 
The second angel blew his trumpet. Something looking like a huge mountain of flaming fire was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea turned to blood, 
and one third of the creatures that lived in the sea died, and one third of all ships were destroyed. 
The third angel blew his trumpet. A great star fell from heaven, blazing brightly. It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water. 
The name of the star is Wormwood, and one third of the water turned bitter, and many people died from drinking the water because it had become poisonous. 
The fourth angel blew his trumpet. One third of the sun, moon, and stars were struck so a third of them would be darkened, and a third part of the day would not give light, similarly the night. 
I saw and heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, shouting loudly, “Disaster, disaster, disaster is coming to those who live on the earth because of what is going to happen when the three remaining angels blow their trumpets.”
