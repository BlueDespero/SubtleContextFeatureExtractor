Chapter 120.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. I called out to the Lord for help in all my troubles, and he answered me. 
Lord, please save me from liars and cheats! 
What will the Lord do to you, you liars? How will he punish you? 
With the sharp arrows of a warrior and burning coals made from a broom tree. 
I'm sorry for myself, because I live as a foreigner in Meshech, or among the tent-dwellers of Kedar. 
I have lived for far too long among people who hate peace. 
I want peace, but when I talk of peace, they want war.
