Chapter 67.
For the music director. To be accompanied by stringed instruments. A psalm. A song. May God be gracious to us and bless us. May he look favorably on us. Selah. 
May everyone on earth come to know your ways, your salvation among all people. 
May the people praise you, God; may all the people praise you. 
May they be happy and sing for joy because you judge people fairly, and you guide everyone on earth. Selah. 
May the people praise you, God; may all the people praise you. 
The earth has produced its crops; and God, our God, has blessed us. 
God will bless us, and all people everywhere will respect him.
