Chapter 24.
A psalm of David. The earth is the Lord's, and everything that is in it belongs to him. The world is his, and everyone who lives there. 
For he is the one who laid its foundations on the seas, setting it in place on the waters. 
Who is allowed to go up the Lord's mountain? Who is permitted to stand in his holy place? 
Those who have clean hands and pure minds, who don't worship idols, and who don't lie under oath. 
They will take with them the blessing of the Lord, vindicated by the God who saves them. 
These are the kind of people who may go to the Lord and worship before you, God of Jacob. Selah. 
Open up, you gates! Swing wide, you ancient doors! Let the King of glory come in! 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord, strong and powerful, mighty in battle. 
Open up, you gates! Swing wide, you ancient doors! Let the King of glory come in! 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord Almighty, he is the King of glory! Selah.
