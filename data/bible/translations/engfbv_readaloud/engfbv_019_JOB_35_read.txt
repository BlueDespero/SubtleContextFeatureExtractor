Job.
Chapter 35.
Then Elihu continued, saying, 
“Do you think it's honest to claim you are right before God? 
And you ask, ‘What benefit do I get? What good has it done me by not sinning?’ 
I'll tell you, and your friends too! 
Just look up at the sky and see. Observe the clouds high above you. 
If you sin, how does that harm God? How do your many sins affect God? 
If you do what's right, what good are you doing for him? 
No—your sins only affect people like yourself, and whatever good you do only affects them too. 
People cry out because of terrible persecution; they call for someone to save them from their oppressors. 
But no one asks, ‘Where is the God my maker, the one who gives songs in the night, 
who teaches us more than the animals, and makes us wiser than the birds?’ 
When they call out for help, God doesn't answer because they are proud and evil people. 
God doesn't listen to their empty cries; the Almighty doesn't pay them any attention. 
How much less will God hear you when you say he can't see you? Your case is before him, so you have to wait for him. 
You're saying that God doesn't punish people in his anger and pays little attention to sin. 
You, Job, are talking nonsense, making long speeches when you know nothing!”
