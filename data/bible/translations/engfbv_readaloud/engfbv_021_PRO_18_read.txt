Proverbs.
Chapter 18.
Selfish people only please themselves, they attack anything that makes good sense. 
Stupid people have no interest in trying to understand, they only want to express their opinions. 
With wickedness comes contempt; with dishonor comes disgrace. 
People's words can be profound like deep waters, a gushing stream that is the source of wisdom. 
It's not right to show favoritism to the guilty and rob the innocent of justice. 
What stupid people say gets them into fights, as if they're asking for a beating. 
Stupid people are caught out by what they say; their own words trap them. 
Listening to gossip is like gulping down bites of your favorite food—they go deep down inside you. 
Laziness and destruction are brothers. 
The Lord is a protective tower that good people can run to and be safe. 
Rich people see their wealth as a fortified town—it's like a high wall in their imagination. 
Pride leads to destruction; humility goes before honor. 
Replying before hearing is stupidity and shame. 
With a brave spirit you can put up with sickness, but if it's crushed, you can't bear it. 
An intelligent mind acquires knowledge; the wise are ready to hear knowledge. 
A gift opens doors for you, and gets you into the presence of important people. 
The first person to plead a case sounds right until someone comes to cross-examine them. 
Casting lots can end disputes and decide between powerful people. 
A brother you've offended is harder to win back than a fortified town. Arguments keep people apart like bars on the doors of a fortress. 
Make sure you're satisfied with what you say—you have to live with your words. 
What you say has the power to bring life or to kill; those who love talking will have to deal with the consequences. 
If you find a wife, that's great, and you'll be blessed by the Lord. 
The poor beg for mercy, but the rich reply harshly. 
Some friends give up on you, but there's a friend who stays closer to you than a brother.
