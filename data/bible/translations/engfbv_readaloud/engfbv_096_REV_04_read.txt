Revelation.
Chapter 4.
After this I saw a door that had been opened in heaven. The voice that I'd heard before, the one that sounded like a trumpet, told me, “Come up here, and I will show you what will happen next.” 
Immediately I was filled by the Spirit and saw a throne set up in heaven, with someone sitting on the throne. 
The one sitting there shone like jewels, like jasper and carnelian, and there was a rainbow that circled the throne, shining like an emerald. 
Around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and twenty-four elders were sitting on these thrones, dressed in white and wearing golden crowns on their heads. 
From the throne lightning flashed and thunder roared. Seven torches blazed in front of the throne—these are the seven Spirits of God. 
Stretching out in front of the throne was a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In the center and all around the throne were four living creatures covered in eyes, both front and back. 
The first creature looked like a lion, the second like a young bull, the third had a human face, and the fourth looked like a flying eagle. 
The four living creatures each had six wings also covered with eyes. Day and night they never stop saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the All-powerful Lord God, who was, who is, and who is to come.” 
Whenever the living creatures glorify, honor, and thank the one that sits on the throne, who lives for ever and ever, 
the twenty-four elders fall down before him that sits on the throne. They will worship the one who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne. They say, 
“Our Lord and our God, you are worthy to be given glory, and honor, and authority, for you created everything. Your will brought Creation into existence.”
