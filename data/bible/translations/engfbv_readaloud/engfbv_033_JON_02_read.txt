Jonah.
Chapter 2.
Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish. 
He began, “In my agony I cried out to the Lord and he answered me; from the depths of Sheol I pleaded for help and you answered me. 
You threw me into the deep, all the way down to the bottom of the sea. Water flooded all around me; your crashing waves rolled over me. 
I said to myself, ‘The Lord has banished me from his sight. Will I ever see your holy Temple again?’ 
The water swirled over me so I couldn't breathe; the deep sucked me down; seaweed wrapped itself around my head. 
I sank down to the base of the mountains; the earth barred me in forever. But you, my Lord, my God, brought me back up from the abyss. 
As my life ebbed away, I remembered the Lord; my prayer came to you in your holy Temple. 
Those who worship worthless idols give up their trust in God's goodness. 
But I will offer you sacrifices, shouting out my thanks. I will keep my promises to you, for salvation comes from the Lord.” 
Then the Lord told the fish to spit out Jonah onto the shore.
