Job.
Chapter 11.
Then Zophar the Naamathite began speaking and said, 
“So many words be answered, shouldn't they? Or is a person proved right by doing a lot of talking? 
Should all your babbling force people to keep quiet? When you mock, shouldn't someone make you feel ashamed? 
You said, ‘What I teach is the pure truth,’ and ‘in God's eyes I am clean.’ 
If only God would speak up and tell you directly, 
because then he would explain to you the secrets of wisdom. True wisdom has many sides to it. God's treatment of you is far better than your guilt deserves. 
Can you find out the mysteries of God? Can you discover all the wisdom of the Almighty? 
It is greater than the heavens—what can you do? It is deeper than Sheol—what can you know? 
It extends farther than the earth, and wider than the sea. 
If God comes and imprisons someone, or assembles the court for judgment, who can stop him? 
For God knows who are deceivers—when he sees someone sin, he pays attention to it. 
Stupid people will become wise when wild donkeys are born tame! 
But if you repent and spread out your hands to pray to him, 
if you get rid of your sins and don't let wickedness continue in your life, 
then you would be able to hold your head high in innocence, you will be firm and unafraid. 
You will forget your misery, remembering it only as water under the bridge. 
Your life will shine brighter than the noonday sun; even darkness will be like the morning. 
You will have confidence because there is hope; you will be protected and rest in safety. 
You will lie down to sleep with no one to frighten you, and many will come asking for your favor. 
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, they will not be able to escape, and their only hope is in death.”
