Chapter 98.
A psalm. Sing the Lord a new song, for he has done wonderful things: by his powerful right hand and his strong arm he has won the victory. 
The Lord has revealed his salvation to the nations, and shown them his goodness. 
He has not forgotten to show his trustworthy love and faithfulness to the descendants of Israel. Our God has made his salvation clear to the ends of the earth. 
Everyone on earth, shout in triumph to the Lord; break out in joyful songs of praise! 
Sing praises to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and melodious voices; 
with trumpets and the sound of the ram's horn sing in happiness before the Lord, the King. 
Let the sea and everything in it shout with praise, together with the earth and everything living in it. 
Let the rivers celebrate, let the hills join in the celebration 
before the Lord, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world justly, and the nations fairly.
