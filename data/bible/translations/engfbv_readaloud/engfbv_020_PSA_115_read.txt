Chapter 115.
Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to you all glory should be given, because of your trustworthy love and faithfulness. 
Why should the heathen nations ask, “Where is your God?” 
Our God is in heaven, and he does whatever he wants. 
Their idols are just things of silver and gold made by human hands. 
They have mouths, but can't speak. They have eyes, but can't see. 
They have ears, but can't hear. They have noses, but can't smell. 
They have hands, but can't feel. They have feet, but can't walk. No sound comes from their throats. 
Those who make idols become just like them, and so does everyone who trusts in them. 
Israel, trust in the Lord! He is the one who helps you and protects you. 
Descendants of Aaron, trust in the Lord! He is the one who helps you and protects you. 
Those who honor the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is the one who helps you and protects you. 
The Lord keeps us in mind and will be good to us. He will bless Israel, he will bless the descendants of Aaron. 
The Lord will bless all those who worship him, whoever they are. 
May the Lord be good to you, you and your children. 
May you be blessed by the Lord who made heaven and earth. 
The heavens belong to the Lord, but he has given the earth to humankind. 
The dead do not praise the Lord, those who have gone down into the silence of the grave. 
But we the living will always praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!
