Chapter 21.
For the music director. A psalm of David. The king celebrates your strength, Lord; he is so happy you made him victorious! 
You gave him everything he wanted; you didn't hold anything back he asked for. 
You welcomed him on his return with special blessings; you placed a crown of pure gold on his head. 
He asked you to give him a good life, and you gave him a long life, forever and ever. 
Your victories brought him great glory; you granted him splendor and majesty. 
You give him blessings forever. He is full of joy because you are with him. 
For the king trusts in the Lord; he stands firm because of the trustworthy love of the Most High. 
You, the king, will find and capture all your enemies; you will seize everyone who hates you. 
When you appear on the scene you will burn them up like in a furnace; the Lord in his anger will destroy them, burning them up with fire. 
You will wipe out their children from the earth, their descendants from humankind. 
Though they plot evil against you, their malicious schemes will not succeed. 
They will turn and run away when they see your arrows fired at them. 
Rise up, Lord, for you are strong! We will sing and praise your power!
