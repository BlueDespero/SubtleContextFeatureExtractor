PSALMS.
Chapter 54.
For the music director. With stringed instruments. A psalm (maskil) of David, concerning the time when the Ziphites came to Saul and told him, “David is hiding among us.” God, because of your very nature, please save me! Vindicate me by your power! 
God, please hear my prayer; listen to what I'm saying. 
For strangers are coming to attack me—violent men who don't care about God are trying to kill me. Selah. 
But God helps me; the Lord saves my life! 
The evil my enemies have done will come back upon them. I depend on you to destroy them. 
I will happily offer a sacrifice to you; I will praise the kind of person you are, Lord, for you are good. 
For he has saved me from all my troubles; and I have seen those who hated me defeated.
