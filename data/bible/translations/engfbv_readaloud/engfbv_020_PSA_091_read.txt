Chapter 91.
Those who live under the protection of the Most High are kept safe by the Almighty. 
This is what I say about the Lord: “He is the one who defends and protects me. He is my God, and I trust in him.” 
For he will save you from hidden traps and deadly diseases. 
He will hide you under his feathers, and shelter you with his wings. His trustworthiness shields and protects you. 
You will not be afraid of terror at night or an arrow that flies in the day, 
or disease that attacks at night, or catastrophe that falls at noon. 
A thousand may fall beside you, ten thousand die at your right hand, but you won't be harmed. 
You only have to open your eyes and you will see how the wicked are repaid. 
Because you have made the Lord your protection, and the Most High your home, 
nothing evil will happen to you; no plague will come near where you live. 
For he will command his angels to take care of you in everything you do. 
They will hold you up with their hands so you won't trip and fall down. 
You will trample lions and snakes; you will tread young lions and serpents underfoot. 
I will save anyone who loves me; I will protect anyone who accepts me. 
When they call out to me for help, I will answer; when they are in trouble, I will be with them. I will save and honor them. 
I will grant them long lives, and show them my salvation.
