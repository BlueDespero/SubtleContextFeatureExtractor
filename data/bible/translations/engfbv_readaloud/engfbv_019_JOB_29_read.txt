Job.
Chapter 29.
Job went on speaking. 
“I wish I was back in the old days when God looked after me! 
His light shone above me and lit my way through the darkness. 
When I was young and strong, God was my friend and spoke to me in my home. 
The Almighty was still with me and I was surrounded with my children. 
My herds produced much milk, and oil flowed freely from my olive presses. 
I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square. 
The young men saw me and moved out of the way; the elders would stand up for me. 
The leaders remained silent and covered their mouths with their hands. 
The voices of the officials were hushed; they held their tongues in my presence. 
Everyone who listened to me praised me; whoever saw me commended me, 
because I gave to the poor who called out to me and the orphans who had no one to help them. 
Those who were about to die blessed me; I made the widow sing for joy. 
Being true and acting right were what I wore for clothing. 
I was like eyes for the blind and feet for the lame. 
I was like a father to the poor, and I defended the rights of strangers. 
I broke the jaw of the wicked and made them drop their prey from their teeth. 
I thought I would die at home, after many years. 
Like a tree my roots spread out to the water; the dew rests on my branches overnight. 
Fresh honors were always being given to me; my strength was renewed like an unfailing bow. 
People listened carefully to what I had to say; they kept quiet as they listened to my advice. 
Once I had spoken they had nothing else to say; what I said was enough. 
They waited for me like people waiting for rain; their mouths wide open for the spring rain. 
When I smiled at them they could hardly believe it; my approval meant all the world to them. 
I decided the way forward as their leader, living like a king among his soldiers, and when they were sad I comforted them.
