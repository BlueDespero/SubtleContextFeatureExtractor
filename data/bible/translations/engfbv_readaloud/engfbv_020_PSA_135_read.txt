Chapter 135.
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord's reputation! Praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord 
who worship in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our God. 
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praises to his character because it is wonderful! 
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself; Israel as his very own. 
I know how great the Lord is—our Lord is greater than all gods. 
The Lord does whatever he wants throughout heaven and earth, on the seas and in the ocean depths. 
He causes the clouds to rise all over the earth, he makes lightning flash and give rain, he sends the winds from his storehouses. 
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both human and animal. 
He did wonderful miracles among you in Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. 
He struck down many nations, he killed powerful kings, such as 
Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, and all the kings who ruled in Canaan. 
He handed over their lands to Israel, his special people, for them to possess. 
Your reputation, Lord, stands forever; you, Lord, are remembered for all generations. 
The Lord will vindicate his people; he will show compassion to those who follow him. 
The idols of the foreign nations are only objects of silver and gold, made by human hands. 
They have mouths, but can't speak; they have eyes, but can't see. 
They have ears, but can't hear; they can't even breathe! 
Those who make idols will become just like them, and so will everyone who trusts in them. 
People of Israel, praise the Lord! Descendants of Aaron, praise the Lord! 
Levites, praise the Lord! Everyone who worships the Lord, praise the Lord! 
Praise the Lord from Zion, for he lives in Jerusalem! Praise the Lord!
