Chapter 42.
For the music director. A psalm (maskil) of the sons of Korah. As a deer longs for flowing streams, so I long for you, God. 
I am thirsty for God, the living God. When can I go and see God's face? 
My tears have been my only food, day and night, while people ask me all day long, “Where is your God?” 
I am crushed as I remember how I walked with the crowds, leading them in a procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and songs of thanks among the worshipers at the festival. 
Why am I so discouraged? Why do I feel so sad? I will hope in God; I will praise him because he is the one who saves me— 
my God! Even though I am very discouraged, I still remember you: from the land of Jordan and Hermon, and from Mount Mizar. 
You thunder through the raging waters, through the noise of the waterfalls. Your crashing waves surge over me—I feel like I'm drowning. 
But every day the Lord shows me his trustworthy love; every night he gives me songs to sing—a prayer to the God of my life. 
I cry out, “My God, my rock, why have you forgotten me? Why must I go around weeping because of the attacks of my enemies?” 
The mocking of my attackers crushes my bones. They're always asking me, “Where is your God?” 
Why am I so discouraged? Why do I feel so sad? I will hope in God; I will praise him because he is the one who saves me—my God!
