Lamentations.
Chapter 5.
Lord, please remember what's happened to us. Look at us and see how we've been humiliated! 
The land we used to own has been handed over to strangers, our houses have been given to foreigners. 
We have lost our fathers, and our mothers are widows. 
The water we drink we have to pay for; our firewood comes at a price. 
Like animals we're driven along with harnesses around our necks; we're worn out but don't find any rest. 
We allied ourselves with Egypt and Assyria so we could have plenty of food. 
Our forefathers sinned and they're gone, but we're being punished for their sins. 
Servants of our conqueror rule over us; no one can save us from their power. 
We take our lives in our hands when we look for food, because of the armed raiders in the desert. 
Our skin is hot like an oven because of the fever caused by hunger. 
They raped women in Zion, virgins in the towns of Judah. 
Princes have been hung up by their hands; they show elders no respect. 
Young men are forced to work at hand-mills; boys stagger under bundles of wood. 
The elders have abandoned their places at the city gate; the young men have given up playing their music. 
There's no more happiness for us; our dancing has turned into mourning. 
The crown has fallen from our head. What a disaster has come upon us because we have sinned! 
Because of all this, we're sick at heart; because of all these things, we can hardly look; 
Because of Mount Zion, which has been abandoned, and where only foxes roam. 
But you, Lord, live forever! You rule for all generations! 
So why have you forgotten us for such a long time? Why have you abandoned us for so many years? 
Bring us back to you, Lord, so we can be with you again. Please remake our lives like they used to be. 
Or have you have completely rejected us? Are you still really furious with us?
