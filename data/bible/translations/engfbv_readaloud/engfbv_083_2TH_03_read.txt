2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Lastly, brothers and sisters, please pray for us, so that the Lord's message may spread and be truly appreciated, just as it is by you— 
and that we may be kept safe from immoral and evil men, because not everyone trusts in God. 
But the Lord is trustworthy and will strengthen you, and protect you from the evil one. 
We have great confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we told you. 
May the Lord lead you into a deeper understanding of God's love for you and the endurance of Christ. 
Now we want to tell you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to associate with any believer who can't be bothered to work for their living—those who don't follow the teachings they learned from us. 
You certainly know that you should follow our example, because while we were with you we weren't lazy, 
—we didn't eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead we worked hard day and night so we wouldn't be a burden to any of you. 
Not that we don't have the right to do so—but we wanted to be an example to you, so that you could copy what we did. 
Even while we were with you we gave strict instructions that anybody who didn't want to work shouldn't eat. 
But now we hear that there are some lazy busybodies among you who don't work at all. 
We're ordering such people, urging them in the Lord Jesus, to settle down and work to pay for their own food. 
Brothers and sisters, don't give up doing good. 
Take note of anyone who doesn't do what we're telling you in this letter, and make sure you don't associate with them, so that they may become embarrassed. 
Don't consider them enemies, but warn them as a brother or sister. 
May the Lord of peace himself grant you peace in every situation in every way. May the Lord be with all of you. 
Notice the greeting to you from me, Paul, in my own handwriting. This is my signature on every letter I write. 
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
