1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
First of all, I want to encourage you to pray for everybody: make requests of God, ask on their behalf, and give thanks. 
Pray like this for kings and all types of leaders so that we may live quiet and peaceful lives, always thinking about God and taking life seriously. 
This is what is good, and what pleases God our Savior. 
He wants everyone to be saved, and come to understand what truth really is. 
For there is one God, and one mediator of God and mankind—the man Christ Jesus. 
He gave himself so we could all be won back, demonstrating the evidence at the right time. 
I was appointed to share this message and be its messenger, a teacher to the foreigners about trusting God and the truth (I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth!) 
What I really want is for men everywhere to pray sincerely to God. No anger or arguments! 
In the same way, women should dress sensibly, modestly, and appropriately. They should be attractive not in their hairstyle or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
but by the good things they do—as is appropriate for women who claim to follow God. 
Women should learn quietly, respecting their place. 
I don't allow women to be instructors, or to dominate men; let them remain quiet. 
For Adam was made first, and then Eve. 
Adam wasn't deceived, but Eve was completely deceived, and she fell into sin. 
However, women will be saved through becoming mothers, as long as they continue to trust and love, and to live holy, sensible lives.
