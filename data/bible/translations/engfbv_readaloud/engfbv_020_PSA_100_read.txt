Chapter 100.
A psalm of thanksgiving. Everyone on earth shout for joy to the Lord! 
Worship the Lord with gladness; come into his presence with joyful songs! 
Know that the Lord is God! He made us, so we belong to him. We are his people, the flock he cares for. 
Go in through his gate with thanks; enter his courts with praise. Thank him; praise him for who he is. 
For the Lord is good. His trustworthy love lasts forever; his faithfulness continues for all generations.
