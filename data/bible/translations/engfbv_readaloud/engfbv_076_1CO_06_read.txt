1 Corinthians.
Chapter 6.
How dare any of you file a lawsuit before pagan judges if you have a dispute with your neighbor! Instead you should bring this before other believers. 
Don't you know that Christian believers will judge the world? If you're going to judge the world, are you not fit to judge in the most minor cases? 
Don't you know we are going to judge angels? How much more those things that relate to this life! 
So if you have to judge things that relate to this life, how can you go to judges that are not respected by the church? 
I'm trying to shame you by saying this. What? You can't find one wise person among you who can settle a dispute that you have? 
Instead one believer takes another believer to court, and places the issue before unbelievers! 
The very fact you have lawsuits against each other already is a complete disaster. Wouldn't it be better to accept the injustice? Why not let yourselves be defrauded? 
But you would rather cause injustice and defraud even your fellow-believers in church. 
Don't you know those who are unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don't be fooled! People who are immoral, worship idols, commit adultery, sexual perverts, homosexuals, 
thieves, greedy, drunkards, abusers, or cheats, will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
Some of you were once like that, but you have been made clean and holy. You have been made right in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. 
People say, “I'm free to do anything”—but not everything is appropriate! “I'm free to do anything”—but I will not let anything control me! People say, 
“Food for the stomach, and the stomach for food”—but God will destroy both of them. Also, the body is not meant to be used for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 
By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us up the same way. 
Don't you know your bodies are parts of Christ's body? Should I take the parts of Christ's body and join them to a prostitute? Absolutely not! 
Don't you realize that anyone who has sex with a prostitute becomes “one body” with her? Remember that Scripture says, “The two will become one body.” 
But whoever is joined to the Lord is one with him in spirit! 
Stay away from sexual immorality! All other sins that people commit are outside of the body, but sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. 
Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit that is within you, that you received from God? 
You don't belong to yourself—a price was paid for you! So glorify God in your body!
