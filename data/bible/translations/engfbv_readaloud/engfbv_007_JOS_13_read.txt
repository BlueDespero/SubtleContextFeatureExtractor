Joshua.
Chapter 13.
Many years had passed by, and Joshua had grown old. The Lord spoke to him, saying, “You're now an old man, but there's still a great deal of land still to be taken. 
This is the remaining land: the territory of all the Philistines and all the Geshurites, 
from the Shihur River on the border with Egypt north to the border of Ekron—all of which is counted as Canaanite but comes under the five Philistine lords of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. In addition there's the land of the Avvites 
in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, all the way to Aphek on the border with the Amorites, 
as well as the land of the Gebalites and the Lebanon area from the town of Baalgad to the slopes of Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath, 
and the those who live in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, including all the land of the Sidonians. I myself will drive them out ahead of the Israelites. Just allocate the land to Israel for them to own, as I have commanded you. 
So divide this land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh for them to own.” 
The other half of the tribe of Manasseh, and the tribes of Reuben and Gad, had already received their land grant on the east side of the Jordan, as allotted to them by Moses, the servant of the Lord. 
It stretched from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon valley, from the town in the middle of the valley, and all the plateau of Medeba, up to Dibon; 
and all the towns that belonged to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, up to the border with the Ammonites. 
In addition it included Gilead, the land of the Geshurites and Maacathites, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah, 
as well as all the land of the kingdom of Og of Bashan, who had ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He was one of the last of the Rephaites. Moses had defeated them and driven them out. 
But the Israelites had not driven out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, who still live among them to this very day. 
Moses did not allocate any land for the Levites to own. Instead they were allotted the offerings made by fire to the Lord, the God of Israel, as the Lord had promised them. 
This was the land that Moses allotted to the tribe of Reuben, by families: 
Their territory stretched from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon valley, from the town in the middle of the valley, and all the plateau of Medeba; 
Heshbon and all associated towns on the plateau—Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, 
Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar, on a hill in the valley, 
Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth— 
all the towns of the plateau and all the kingdom of Sihon, the Amorite king, who ruled in Heshbon. He was defeated by Moses, as well as the Midianite leaders Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, princes who lived in the kingdom and who were allied to Sihon. 
At the same time the Israelites killed Balaam, son of Beor, the fortune-teller, along with the others who were slaughtered. 
The Jordan was the boundary for the tribe of Reuben. This was the land, the towns and the villages, allotted to the tribe of Reuben, by families. 
This was the land that Moses allotted to the tribe of Gad, by families: 
Their territory was Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, and half of the land of the Ammonites up to Aroer, near Rabbah; 
stretching from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the Debir region. 
In the Jordan valley lay Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon. The boundary ran along the Jordan up to the bottom end of the sea of Kinnereth and then ran east. 
This was the land, the towns and the villages, allotted to the tribe of Gad, by families. 
This was the land that Moses allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is half of the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh, by families: 
Their territory stretched from Manahaim through the whole of Bashan, all the kingdom of Og, and all the towns of Jair in Bashan—sixty in all. 
Also included was Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, the towns of king Og in Bashan. This was the land allotted to the descendants of Machir, son of Manasseh, for half of them, by families. 
These were the allocations that Moses made when he was in the plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan, east of Jericho. 
However, Moses did not allot any land to the Levites, for the Lord, the God of Israel, had promised them that he would be their allocation.
