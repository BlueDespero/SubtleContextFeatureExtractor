Proverbs.
Chapter 9.
Wisdom has built her house; she has prepared its seven pillars. 
She has slaughtered her animals for meat; she has mixed her wine; and she has set her table. 
She has sent out her servant girls with invitations. She calls out from the highest places of the town, 
“Everybody who needs to learn, come and see me!” To people who don't have any sense she says, 
“Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 
Leave your foolish ways and you will live; follow the path that makes sense.” 
If you correct a mocker all you get are insults; if you argue with the wicked all you get is abuse. 
So don't argue with mockers or they'll only hate you; argue with the wise and they'll love you. 
Educate the wise and they'll become even wiser; teach those who live right and they will increase their learning. 
Honoring the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; knowledge of the Holy One brings insight. 
Through wisdom you'll have many more days, increasing the years of your life. 
If you are wise, you are the one to profit from it; if you scoff, you alone will have to suffer the consequences. 
Stupidity is like a loud, ignorant woman who doesn't know anything. 
She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the town, 
calling out to those passing by, going about their business, 
“Everybody who needs to learn, come and see me!” To people who don't have any sense she says, 
“Stolen water is sweet, and food eaten in secret tastes good!” 
But they don't know that the dead are there, that those she's invited are in the depths of the grave.
