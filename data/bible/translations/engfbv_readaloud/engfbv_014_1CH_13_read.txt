1 Chronicles.
Chapter 13.
David had discussions with all his leaders, including the army commanders of thousands and hundreds. 
Then he addressed the whole assembly of Israel, saying, “If you agree, and if God approves, let us send an invitation to every Israelite in the land, including the priests and Levites in their towns and pastures, to come and join us. 
Let us bring the Ark of our God back to us, because we forgot about it during the time of Saul.” 
The whole assembly was pleased with the proposal, agreeing that this would be a good thing to do. 
So David summoned all of Israel, from the Shihor River of Egypt up to Lebo-hamath, to help bring the Ark from Kiriath-jearim. 
So David and all of Israel went to Baalah (otherwise called Kiriath-jearim) in Judah to bring back the Ark of God the Lord, whose throne is between the cherubim and who is called by the Name. 
They loaded the Ark of God onto a brand new cart and brought it from Adinadab's house, with Uzzah and Ahio directing it. 
David and all of Israel were celebrating before the Lord as loudly as possible, singing sings and playing music on lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 
But when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, the oxen stumbled and Uzzah stretched out his hand to stop the Ark falling. 
The Lord was angry with Uzzah for daring to touch the Ark like this so he struck him down, and Uzzah died there before the Lord. 
David became angry with the Lord for his violent outburst against Uzzah. He named the place Perez-uzzah, and it is still called that today. 
David became afraid of God that day. “How can I ever bring back the Ark of God home to me?” he asked. 
So David did not move the Ark of God to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he had it taken to the home of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
The Ark of God remained in Obed-edom's home for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom's household and all that he had.
