Chapter 87.
A song. A psalm of the descendants of Korah. The Lord founded the city on his holy mountain. 
Jerusalem is the city that the Lord loves more than any other city in Israel. 
Many wonderful things are said of you, city of God! Selah. 
I mention Egypt and Babylon as those who know me, and in addition Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia—“this man was born there.” 
It will be said concerning Jerusalem, “Everyone was born there,” and the Most High will make it secure. 
When the Lord registers the nations, he will write, “They were born there.” Selah. 
Singers and dancers alike say, “Living here I am at home.”
