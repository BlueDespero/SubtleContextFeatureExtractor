Song of Songs.
Chapter 3.
One night when I was lying in bed, I longed for the one I love. I longed for him, but he was nowhere to be found. 
So I said to myself, “I will get up now and go through the city, looking in its streets and squares for the one I love.” I looked for him but I didn't find him. 
The watchmen found me as they went through the city. “Have you seen the one I love?” I asked them. 
Only a little farther on after I'd passed them I found my love! I held him close and would not let him go until I'd brought him to my mother's house, to the room of the one who conceived me. 
Women of Jerusalem, swear to me by the gazelles or the wild deer that you won't disturb our love until the right time. 
Who is this coming in from the wilderness like a plume of smoke, like a burning sacrifice scented with myrrh and frankincense, with all kinds of imported perfumed powders? 
Look, it's Solomon's sedan chair, accompanied by sixty of Israel's best warriors. 
All of them are expert swordsmen who have battle experience. They each carry a sword strapped to the thigh, ready for any night-time attacks. 
(Solomon's sedan chair was made for him with wood from Lebanon. 
Its posts were covered in silver, and the back was covered in gold. The seat cushion was purple. The interior was lovingly decorated.) Women of Jerusalem, 
come out! Look, women of Zion! See King Solomon wearing the crown that his mother placed on his head on his wedding day, his happiest day.
