Job.
Chapter 10.
I hate my life! Let me speak freely about my complaints—I can't keep my bitterness to myself. 
I will tell God, “Don't just condemn me—tell me what you have against me. 
Do you enjoy accusing me? Why do you reject me, someone you made with your own hands, and yet smile on the scheming of the wicked? 
Do you have human eyes? Do you see like human beings do? 
Is your life as short as mortal beings? Are your years as brief as those of humanity, 
that you have to examine my wrongs and investigate my sins? 
Even though you know I'm not guilty, no one can save me from you. 
You made me and shaped me with your own hands, and yet you destroy me. 
Remember that you shaped me like a piece of clay—are you now going to turn me back into dust? 
You poured me out like milk, you curdled me like cheese. 
You clothed me with skin and flesh; you wove my body together with bones and muscles. 
You granted me life and showed me your kindness; you have taken great care of me. 
But you kept these things hidden in your heart. I know your purpose was 
to watch me, and if I sinned, then you would not forgive my wrongs. 
If I'm guilty I'm in trouble, if I'm innocent I can't hold my head high because I'm totally disgraced as I look at my sufferings. 
If I do hold my head high you hunt me down like a lion, showing how powerful you are in hurting me. 
You repeat your arguments against me, you pour out more and more of your anger against me, you send fresh armies against me. 
So why did you allow me to be born? I wish that I had died, and nobody had ever seen me! 
It would have been better if I had never existed, taken straight from the womb to the grave. 
I only have a few days left, so why don't you leave me alone so I can have a little peace 
before I go to where I shall never return from, the land of darkness and the shadow of death— 
the land of total darkness where death's shadow lies, a place of chaos where light itself is darkness.”
