1 Peter.
Chapter 4.
Since Christ suffered physically, you must prepare yourselves with the same attitude he had—for those who suffer physically have turned away from sin. 
You will not live the rest of your lives following human desires, but doing what God wants. 
In the past you've spent enough time following the ways of the world: immorality, sexual indulgence, drunken orgies, partying, binge drinking, and revolting idol-worship. 
People think it's strange that you don't join them anymore in this wild and excessive lifestyle, so they curse at you. But they will have to explain what they've done to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
That's why the good news was shared with those who've already died— 
so that although they were rightly judged as far as being sinful human beings is concerned, they could live in the spirit as far as God is concerned. 
Everything is coming to an end! So think clearly and stay alert when you pray. 
Most of all, you should love one another very deeply, for love covers many of the wrong things people do. 
Show hospitality to each another, and don't complain. 
Whatever gift you've been given, share it with others among you, as people who wisely demonstrate God's grace in all its different forms. 
Anyone who speaks should do so as though God is speaking through them. Anyone who wants to help others should do so through the strength that God gives, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. May glory and power be his forever and ever. Amen. 
My friends, don't be alarmed at the “ordeals of fire” you're having, as if these were unexpected. 
Be happy to the extent that you share in Christ's suffering, because when he appears in his glory, you will be incredibly happy! 
If you are cursed in Christ's name, you're blessed, for God's glorious spirit rests on you. 
If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or as a gossip— 
but if it's as a Christian, then you don't need to be ashamed. Instead praise God that you're called by that name! 
For the time of judgment has come—and it begins with the house of God. If it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God's good news? 
“If it's hard for those who live right to be saved, what will happen to sinners, those who oppose God?” 
So then those who suffer according to the will of God, the trustworthy Creator, should make sure they are doing good.
