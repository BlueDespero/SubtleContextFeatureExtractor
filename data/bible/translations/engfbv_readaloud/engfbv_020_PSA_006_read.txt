Chapter 6.
For the music director. To be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the sheminith. A psalm of David. Lord, please don't condemn me because you're angry with me; please don't punish me because you're angry with me! 
Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak; heal me, Lord, for I am sick to the bone. 
I'm shaking all over in fear. How long will it be, Lord, before you do something? 
Turn, Lord, and rescue me! Save me because of your trustworthy love! 
For no one remembers you when they're dead. Who is able to praise you from the grave? 
My groaning has exhausted me. Every night I soak my bed with my crying; I drench my couch with my tears. 
With all my crying I can hardly see; my eyes grow weak because of the trouble my enemies cause me. 
Leave me alone, all you people who do evil, for the Lord has heard me crying! 
The Lord has heard me calling out for help; the Lord answers my prayer. 
All who hate me will be shamefully defeated and terrified; they will run away in disgrace.
