1 Chronicles.
Chapter 28.
David summoned to Jerusalem all the leaders of Israel—the leaders of the tribes, the army division commanders in service to the king, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and livestock of the king and his sons, along with the court officials, the warriors and all the best fighting men. 
King David got to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people! I really wanted to build a house as a resting place for the Ark of the Lord's Agreement, as a footstool for our God. So I made plans to build it. 
But God told me, ‘You are not to build a house to honor me because you are a man of war who has spilled blood.’ 
However, the Lord, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my father's family to be king of Israel forever. For he chose Judah as the leading tribe, and from among the families of Judah he chose my father's family. From among my father's sons he was pleased to chose me as king over the whole of Israel. 
From all my sons (for the Lord gave me many) the Lord has chosen Solomon my child to sit on the throne and to rule over the Lord's kingdom Israel. 
He told me, ‘Your son Solomon is the one who will build my house and my courts, because I have chosen him as my son, and I will be his father. 
I will make sure his kingdom lasts forever if he single-mindedly keeps my commandments and regulations like he does today. 
So now, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and as God listens, be sure to obey all the commandments of the Lord your God so that you may go on possessing this good land and be able to pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever. 
Solomon my son, get to know the God of your father. Serve him with complete dedication and with a willing mind, for the Lord examines every motivation and understands the intention of every thought. If you look for him, you will find him; but it you abandon him, he will reject you forever. 
Pay attention now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and take action!” 
Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the Temple porch, its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the “place of atonement.” 
He also gave him everything he had planned for the courts of the house of the Lord, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God and of those things that had been dedicated. 
In addition he passed on instructions regarding the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of service of the house of the Lord, and for all that was used for worship in the house of the Lord. 
He also laid down how much gold and silver was to be used in making the different objects used in every kind of service, 
the weight of the gold and silver lampstands and their lamps, depending on the use of each lampstand; 
the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and the weight of silver for the silver tables, 
the weight of pure gold for the forks, basins, and cups; the weight of each gold dish; the weight of each silver bowl; 
the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense; and lastly plans for a golden chariot of cherubim that spread their wings, covering the Ark of the Lord's Agreement. 
“All this is in writing from the hand of the Lord, given to me as instructions—every detail of this plan,” said David. 
Then David also told Solomon, “Be strong, be brave, and take action! Don't be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you! He will not let you down or leave you. He will make sure all the work for the service of the house of the Lord is finished. 
The divisions of the priests and the Levites are prepared for all the service of the house of God. People will be willing to use their different skills to help you in all the work—the officials and all the people will do what you tell them.”
