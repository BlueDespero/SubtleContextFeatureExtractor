Chapter 85.
For the music director. A psalm of the descendants of Korah Lord, you have shown your kindness to your land; you have restored Jacob's prosperity. 
You took away your people's guilt; you forgave all their sins. Selah. 
You took back your fury; you turned away from your fierce anger. 
Bring us back to you, God of our salvation! Take away your anger towards us. 
Are you going to be furious with us forever? Will you stay angry with us for all future generations? 
Won't you restore our lives so your people can find happiness in you? 
Show us your trustworthy love, Lord! Give us your salvation! 
Let me hear what God has to say. God speaks peace to his people, to those who trust in him. But they must not return to their foolish ways. 
Truly God's salvation is with those who do as he says. His glorious presence will live with us in our land. 
Trustworthiness and faithful love join together; goodness and peace have kissed each other. 
What is true grows up from the earth; what is right looks down from heaven. 
The Lord will certainly give us all that is good, and our land will produce fine crops. 
Truth and right go ahead of him to prepare a path for him to walk on.
