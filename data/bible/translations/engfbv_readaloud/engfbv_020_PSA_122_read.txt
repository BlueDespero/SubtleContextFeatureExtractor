Chapter 122.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. A psalm of David. I was so happy when they said to me, “Let's go the house of the Lord.” 
Now we're standing inside your gates, Jerusalem! 
Jerusalem is built as a city where people can be together. 
All the tribes—the tribes of the Lord—go up there, following the command given to Israel to give thanks to the Lord. 
This is where the thrones are placed, where judgment is given, the thrones of the house of David. 
Pray that Jerusalem may be at peace. May everyone who loves Jerusalem be kept safe. 
May there be peace within your walls, and safety within your fortresses. 
On behalf of my family and friends, I will now say, “May you be at peace.” 
On behalf of the house of the Lord our God, I pray that everything goes well for you.
