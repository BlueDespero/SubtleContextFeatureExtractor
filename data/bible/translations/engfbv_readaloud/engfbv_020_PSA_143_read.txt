Chapter 143.
A psalm of David. Lord, please hear my prayer. Because you are faithful, please listen to my appeal for mercy. Answer me because you do what is right! 
Please don't place me, your servant, on trial, because nobody is innocent in your sight. 
The enemy has chased me down. He crushes me to the ground. He makes me live in darkness like those who died a long time ago. 
I sense myself fading away inside; I am overwhelmed by a sense of desolation. 
I think of days long ago, and as I meditate I talk to myself about all you have done, I reflect on what you have accomplished. 
I stretch out my hands to you, thirsting for you like dried-out land. Selah. 
Please answer me quickly, Lord! I'm dying! Don't turn away otherwise I'll be just like those who are going down into the grave. 
Tell me every morning about your trustworthy love, because I put my confidence in you. Show me the way I should go, because I dedicate myself to you. 
Save me from those who hate me, Lord—I run to you for protection. 
Teach me your will for you are my God. May your spirit of goodness lead me and make my way smooth. 
Because of the kind of person you are, let me go on living. Because you always do what's right, get me out of the trouble I'm in. 
In your trustworthy love, get rid of those who hate me, destroy all my enemies, for I am your servant.
