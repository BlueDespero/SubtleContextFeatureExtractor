Chapter 57.
For the music director. According to “Do Not Destroy.” A psalm (miktam) of David concerning the time he fled from Saul and hid in the cave. Please be kind to me, God! Be kind to me because I come to you for protection. I will shelter under the shadow of your wings until the danger is past. 
I cry out for help to God Most High, to God who vindicates me. 
From heaven he sends his help, and he saves me. He defeats those who persecute me. Selah. God sends me his unfailing love, showing he is completely trustworthy. 
I am surrounded by man-eating lions—I am forced to live with them! Their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongues are swords. 
God, your greatness is above the highest heavens; and your glory covers the whole earth! 
They set a trap to catch me. I was so depressed. They dug a pit on my path but they were the ones who fell into it. Selah. 
I have confidence in you, God, I have confidence in you. I will sing songs of praise to you. 
I say to myself, “Wake up!” Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn! 
I will thank you among the peoples, Lord; I will sing your praises among the nations. 
Your faithful love reaches to the heavens; your trustworthiness to the clouds. 
God, your greatness is above the highest heavens; and your glory covers the whole earth!
