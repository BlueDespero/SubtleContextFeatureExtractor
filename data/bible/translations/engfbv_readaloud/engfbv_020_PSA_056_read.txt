Chapter 56.
For the music director. According to “Dove on Distant Oaks.” A psalm (miktam) of David concerning the time the Philistines captured him in Gath. God, please be gracious to me, for people are persecuting me; my attackers fight against me all day long. 
My enemies chase me down all the time—there are many of them, attacking me in their arrogance. 
But when I'm afraid, I trust in you. 
I thank God for his promises. I trust in God, so why should I be fearful? What can mere human beings do to me? 
They constantly twist my words against me; they spend all their time thinking of evil things to do to me. 
They gather together in their hiding places to keep watch on me, hoping to kill me. 
Will they escape when they do so much evil? God, in anger bring these people down! 
You've kept track of all my wanderings. You've collected all my tears in your bottle. You've kept a record of each one. 
Then those who hate me will run away when I call for your help. For I know this: God is for me! 
I thank God for his promises. I thank the Lord for his promises. 
I trust in God, so why should I be fearful? What can mere human beings do to me? 
God, I will keep my promises to you. I will give thank offerings to you, 
for you have saved me from death and kept me from falling. Now I walk in the presence of God, in the light that gives life.
