Hebrews.
Chapter 4.
Therefore let's take care to make sure that even though God has given us his promise of entering his rest, none of you miss out! 
For we've heard the good news just like they did, but it didn't help them because they didn't accept and trust in what they heard. 
However, those of us who trust in God have entered into that rest God mentioned when he said, “In my frustration I vowed, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’” (This is so even though God's plans were already complete when he created the world.) 
Regarding the seventh day there's a place in Scripture that says, “God rested on the seventh day from all his work.” 
And as the previous passage stated, “They shall not enter my rest.” 
God's rest is still there for some to enter, even though those who previously heard the good news failed to enter because of disobedience. 
So God again sets a day—today—saying a long time later through David as he did before, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't have a hard-hearted attitude.” 
For if Joshua had been able to give them rest, God wouldn't have spoken later about another day. 
So a Sabbath rest remains for God's people. 
For whoever enters God's rest also rests from what he's doing, just as God did. 
As a result we should try hard to enter that rest so nobody falls through following the same bad example of disobedience. 
For God's word is alive and effective, sharper than any twin-edged sword, so penetrating it separates life and breath, bone joints and their marrow, judging the thoughts and intentions of the mind. 
No living being is hidden from his sight; everything is exposed and visible to the one we're accountable to. 
Since we have such a great high priest who has ascended to heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us make sure we hold on to what we say we believe. 
For the high priest we have isn't one who doesn't sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in all the ways we are, but did not sin. 
So we should go confidently to God on his throne of grace so we can receive mercy, and discover grace to help us when we really need it.
