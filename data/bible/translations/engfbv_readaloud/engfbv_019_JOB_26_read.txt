Job.
Chapter 26.
Job replied, 
“How helpful you have been to this feeble man that I am. How supportive you have been to the weak. 
What good advice you have given to this ignorant man, demonstrating you have so much wisdom. 
Who helped you speak these words? Who inspired you to say such things? 
The dead tremble, those beneath the waters. 
Sheol lies naked before God, Abaddon is uncovered. 
He stretches the northern sky over empty space; he hangs the world on nothing. 
He gathers the rain in his storm clouds which do not break under the weight. 
He veils his throne; covering it with his clouds. 
On the surface of the waters he set a boundary; he set a limit dividing light from darkness. 
The pillars of heaven tremble; they shake with fear at his rebuke. 
He calmed the sea with his power; because he knew what to do he crushed Rahab. 
The breath of his voice made the heavens beautiful; with his hand he pierced the gliding serpent. 
This is just a little of all he does—what we hear of him is hardly a whisper, so who can understand his thunderous power?”
