Chapter 77.
To the victory on Jeduthun, the psalm of Asaph. With my voice I cried to the Lord, with my voice to God; and he gave attention to me. 
In the day of my tribulation I sought God with mine hands; in the night before or toward him, and I am not deceived. My soul forsook to be comforted; 
I was mindful of God, and I delighted, and I was exercised; and my spirit failed. 
Mine eyes before took wakings; I was troubled, and I spake not. 
I thought on eld or old days; and I had in mind everlasting years. 
And I thought in the night with mine heart; and I was exercised, and I cleansed my spirit. 
Whether God shall cast away with-out end; either shall he not lay to, that he be more pleased yet? 
Either shall he cut away his mercy into the end; from generation into generation? 
Either shall God forget to do mercy; either shall he withhold his mercies in his ire or wrath? 
And I said, Now I began; this is the changing of the right hand of the high God. 
I had mind on the works of the Lord; for I shall have mind from the beginning of thy marvels. 
And I shall think on all thy works; and I shall be exercised, either occupied, in thy findings. 
God, thy way was in the holy place; what God is great as our God? 
thou art God, that doest marvels. Thou madest thy virtue known among peoples; 
thou again-boughtest in thine arm thy people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph. 
God, waters saw thee, waters saw thee, and dreaded; and depths of waters were troubled. 
The multitude of the sound of waters; clouds gave voice. For why thine arrows pass through; 
the voice of thy thunder was in a wheel. Thy lightnings shined to the world; the earth was moved, and trembled. 
Thy way in the sea, and thy paths in many waters; and thy steps shall not be known. 
Thou leddest forth thy people as sheep; in the hand of Moses and Aaron.
