Chapter 112.
Alleluia. Blessed is the man that dreadeth the Lord; he shall delight full much in his commandments. 
His seed shall be mighty in the earth; the generation of rightful or right men shall be blessed. 
Glory and riches be in his house; and his rightfulness or rightwiseness dwelleth into the world of world. 
Light is risen up in darknesses to rightful or right men; the Lord is merciful in will, and a merciful doer, and rightful or rightwise. 
The man is merry, that doeth mercy, and lendeth; he disposeth his words in doom; 
for he shall not be moved without end. A just or rightwise man shall be in everlasting mind; 
he shall not dread of an evil hearing. His heart is ready for to hope in the Lord; 
his heart is confirmed, he shall not be moved, till he despise his enemies. 
He spreaded abroad, he gave to poor men; his rightwiseness dwelleth into the world of world; his horn shall be raised in glory. 
A sinner shall see, and shall be wroth; he shall gnash with his teeth, and shall fail, either shall wax rotten; the desire of sinners shall perish.
