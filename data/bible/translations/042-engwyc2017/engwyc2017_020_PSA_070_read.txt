Chapter 70.
To the victory, the psalmof David, to have mind. God, behold thou into mine help; Lord, haste thou to help me. 
Be they shamed, and ashamed; that seek my life. Be they turned aback; and shame they, that will or desire evils to me. 
Be they turned away anon, and shame they; that say to me, Well! well! 
All men that seek thee, make fully joy or full out joy they, and be glad in thee; and they that love thine health, say evermore, The Lord be magnified. 
Forsooth I am a needy man, and poor; God help thou me. Thou art mine helper and my deliverer; Lord, tarry thou not.
