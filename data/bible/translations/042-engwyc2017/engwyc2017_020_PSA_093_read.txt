Chapter 93.
The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with fairness; the Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded himself. For he made steadfast the world; that shall not be moved. 
God, thy seat was made ready from that time; thou art from the world. 
Lord, the floods have raised; the floods have raised their voice. Floods have raised their waves; of the voices of many waters. 
The raisings of the sea be wonder-ful; the Lord is wonderful in high things. 
Thy witnessings be made able to be believed greatly; Lord, holiness be-cometh thine house, into the length of days.
