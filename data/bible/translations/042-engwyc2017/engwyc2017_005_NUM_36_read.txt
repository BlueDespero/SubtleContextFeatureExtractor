NUMBERS.
Chapter 36.
Soothly and the princes of the meines of Gilead, the son of Machir, son of Manasseh, of the generation of the sons of Joseph, nighed, and spake to Moses before the princes of Israel, 
and said, The Lord commanded to thee our lord, that thou shouldest part the land by lot to the sons of Israel, and that thou shouldest give to the daughters of Zelophehad, our brother, the possession due to their father. 
And if men of another lineage shall take to wives these daughters, their possession shall pursue or followthem, and it shall be translated or brought over to another lineage, and so it shall be decreased from our heritage; 
and so it shall be done, that when the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth year of remission, cometh, the parting of lots be confounded, or fail, and that the possession of other men pass to other men. 
Moses answered to the sons of Israel, and said, for the Lord com-manded, The lineage of the sons of Joseph hath spoken rightfully, 
and this law is announced of the Lord on the daughters of Zelophehad; be they wedded to which men they will, only to the men of their lineage; 
lest the possession of the sons of Joseph be meddled or mingled from lineage into lineage. For all men shall wed wives of their lineage and kindred; 
and each daughter, that shall have the heritage, shall be wife to one man of the kindred of her father, 
and the lineages be not meddled or mingled to themselves, but dwell so, as those be parted of the Lord. 
And the daughters of Zelophehad did, as it was commanded to them. 
And Mahlah, and Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, were wedded to the sons of their father’s brothers, 
of the meine of Manasseh, that was the son of Joseph; and the possession that was given to them, dwelled in the lineage, and in the meine, of their father. 
These be the commandments and dooms, which the Lord commanded, by the hand of Moses, to the sons of Israel, in the field places of Moab, above Jordan, against Jericho.
