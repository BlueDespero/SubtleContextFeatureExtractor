HOSEA.
Chapter 3.
And the Lord said to me, Yet go thou, and love a woman loved of a friend, and a woman adulteress, as the Lord loveth the sons of Israel; and they behold to alien gods, and love the dregs of grapes. 
And I delved it to me by fifteen pence, and by a cor of barley, and by half a cor of barley. 
And I said to it, By many days thou shalt abide me; thou shalt not do fornication, and thou shalt not be with an husband, but also I shall abide thee. 
For by many days the sons of Israel shall sit without king, without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without priest’s cloth, and without teraphim, that is, images. 
And after these things the sons of Israel shall turn again, and shall seek their Lord God, and David, their king; and they shall dread at the Lord, and at the good of him, in the last days.
