Chapter 85.
To the overcomer, the song of the sons of Korah. Lord, thou hast blessed thy land; thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. 
Thou hast forgiven the wicked-ness of thy people; thou hast covered all the sins of them. 
Thou hast assuaged all thine ire; thou hast turned away from the ire of thine indignation. 
God, our health, convert thou us; and turn away thine ire from us. 
Whether thou shalt be wroth to us without end; either shalt thou hold forth thine ire from generation into generation? 
God, thou converted, shalt quicken us; and thy people shall be glad in thee. 
Lord, show thy mercy to us; and give thine health to us. 
I shall hear what the Lord God shall speak in me; for he shall speak peace to his people. And on his holy men; and on them that be turned to heart. 
Nevertheless his health is nigh men dreading him; that glory dwell in our land. 
Mercy and truth met themselves; rightwiseness and peace were kissed. 
Truth came forth of the earth; and rightfulness or rightwiseness beheld from heaven. 
For the Lord shall give benignity; and our earth shall give his fruit. 
Rightfulness or Rightwiseness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.
