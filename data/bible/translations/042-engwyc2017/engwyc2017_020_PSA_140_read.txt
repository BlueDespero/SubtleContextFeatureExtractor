Chapter 140.
To victory, the psalm of David. Lord, deliver thou me from an evil man; deliver thou me from a wicked man. 
Which thought wickednesses in the heart; all day they ordained battles. 
They sharpened their tongues as serpents; the venom of snakes is under the lips of them. 
Lord, keep thou me from the hand of the sinner; and deliver thou me from wicked men. Which thought to deceive my goings; 
proud men hid a snare to me. And they laid forth cords into a snare; they setted a trap to me beside the way. 
I said to the Lord, Thou art my God; Lord, hear thou the voice of my beseeching. 
Lord, Lord, the virtue of mine health; thou madest a shadow on mine head in the day of battle. 
Lord, betake thou not me from my desire to the sinner; they thought against me, forsake thou not me, lest peradventure they be enhanced. 
The head of the compass of them; the travail of their lips shall cover them. 
Coals shall fall on them, thou shalt cast them down into fire; into wretchednesses where they shall not be able to stand. 
A man that is a great jangler shall not be dressed or rightforth ruled in earth; evils shall take an unjust man into perishing. 
I have known, that the Lord shall make doom of a needy man; and the vengeance of poor men. 
Nevertheless just or rightwise men shall acknowledge to thy name; and rightful or right men shall dwell with thy cheer.
