Chapter 137.
On the floods of Babylon, there we sat, and wept; while we bethought on Zion. 
In sallows in the midst thereof; we hanged up our organs. 
For they that led us prisoners; asked us there the words of songs. And they that led away us said; Sing ye to us an hymn of the songs of Zion. 
How shall we sing a song of the Lord; in an alien land? 
If I forget thee, Jerusalem; my right hand be given to forgetting. 
My tongue cleave to my cheeks; if I bethink not on thee. If I purposed not of thee, Jerusalem; in the beginning of my gladness. 
Lord, have thou mind on the sons of Edom; for the day of Jerusalem. Which say, Extinguish ye, extinguish ye; till to the foundament therein. 
Thou wretched daughter of Bab-ylon; he is blessed, that yieldeth to thee thy yielding, which thou yieldest to us. 
He is blessed, that shall hold; and hurtle down his little children at the stone.
