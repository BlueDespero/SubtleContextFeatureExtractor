PSALMS.
Chapter 75.
To the overcomer, lose thou not the psalm of the song of Asaph. God, we shall acknowledge to thee, we shall acknowledge; and we shall inwardly call thy name. We shall tell thy marvels; 
when I shall take hold of the time, I shall deem with rightfulnesses. 
The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein; I confirmed the pillars thereof. 
I said to wicked men, Do not ye do wickedly; and to trespassers, Do not ye enhance the horn. 
Do not ye raise on high your horn; do not ye speak wickedness against God. 
For promotion cometh neither from the east, neither from the west, neither from desert hills; 
for God is the judge. He meeketh this man, and enhanceth him; 
for a cup of clean wine, full of meddling or mingling, is in the hand of the Lord. And he bowed of this into that; nevertheless the dregs thereof is not diminished, either made less, for all the sinners of the earth shall drink thereof. 
Forsooth I shall tell into the world; I shall sing to God of Jacob. 
And I shall break all the horns of sinners; and the horns of the just or rightwise man shall be enhanced.
