PSALMS.
Chapter 30.
The psalm ofthesong, for the hallowing of the house of David. Lord, I shall enhance thee, for thou hast up-taken me; and thou delighted-est not mine enemies on me. 
My Lord God, I cried to thee; and thou madest me whole. 
Lord, thou leddest out my soul from hell; thou savedest me from them that go down into the pit. 
Ye saints of the Lord, sing to the Lord; and acknowledge ye to the mind of his holiness. 
For ire is in his indignation; and life is in his will. Weeping shall dwell at eventide; and gladness at the morrowtide. 
Forsooth I said in my plenty; I shall not be moved without end. 
Lord, in thy will; thou hast given virtue to my fairness. Thou turnedest away thy face from me; and I am made troubled. 
Lord, I shall cry to thee; and I shall pray to my God. 
What profit is in my blood; while I go down into corruption? Whether dust shall acknowledge to thee; either it shall tell of thy truth? 
The Lord heard, and had mercy on me; the Lord is made mine helper. 
Thou hast turned my wailing into joy to me; thou hast rent my sack-cloth, and hast encompassed me with gladness. 
That my glory sing to thee, and I be not compunct; my Lord God, I shall acknowledge to thee without end.
