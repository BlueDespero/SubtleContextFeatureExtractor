ZECHARIAH.
Chapter 13.
In that day an open well shall be to the house of David, and to men dwelling at Jerusalem, into washing away of a sinful man, and of a woman defouled in unclean blood. 
And it shall be, in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I shall destroy the names of idols from the land, and they shall no more be thought on; and I shall take away from earth false prophets, and an unclean spirit. 
And it shall be, when any man shall prophesy any more, his father and mother that engendered him, shall say to him, Thou shalt not live, for thou hast spoken leasing in the name of the Lord; and his father and his mother, the engenderers of him, shall prick him, when he hath prophesied. 
And it shall be, in that day, prophets shall be ashamed, each of his vision, when he shall prophesy; neither they shall be covered with a mantle of sackcloth, that they lie; 
but he shall say, I am not a prophet; I am a man an earth-tiller, for Adam is mine ensample from my youth. 
And it shall be said to him, What be these wounds in the middle of thine hands? And he shall say, With these I was wounded in the house of them that loved me. 
Sword, be thou raised on my shepherd, and on a man cleaving to me, saith the Lord of hosts; smite thou the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. And I shall turn mine hand to the little ones. 
And two parts of the people shall be in each land, saith the Lord, and they shall be scattered, and shall fail, and the third part shall be left in it. 
And I shall lead the third part by fire, and I shall burn them, as silver is burnt, and I shall prove them, as gold is proved. He shall call to help my name, and I shall graciously hear him; and I shall say, Thou art my people, and he shall say, Thou art my Lord God.
