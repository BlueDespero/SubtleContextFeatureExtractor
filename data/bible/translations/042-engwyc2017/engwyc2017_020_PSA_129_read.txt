Chapter 129.
The song of degrees. Israel say now; Oft they have fought against me from my youth. 
Oft they have fought against me from my youth; and soothly they might not to me 
Sinners forged on my back; they made long their wickedness. 
The Lord is just or rightwise, he shall beat the nolls of sinners; 
all that hate Zion be they shamed, and turned aback. 
Be they made as the hay of housetops; that dried up, before that it be drawn up. 
Of which hay he that shall reap, shall not fill his hand; and he that shall gather handfuls, shall not fill his bosom. 
And they that passed forth said not, The blessing of the Lord be on you; we blessed you in the name of the Lord.
