1ST CHRONICLES.
Chapter 20.
Forsooth it was done after the end of a year, in that time wherein kings be wont to go forth to battles, Joab gathered the host, and the strength of chivalry, and he wasted the land of the sons of Ammon, and went, and besieged Rabbah; forsooth David dwelled in Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. 
And David took the crown of Malcham from his head, and found therein the weight of gold a talent, and most precious gems, and he made thereof a diadem to himself; also he took full many spoils of the city. 
And he led out the people that was therein, and made brads, either instru-ments by which corns be broken, and sleds, and iron chariots, to pass over on them, so that all men were cut into diverse parts, and were all-broken; David did thus to all the cities of the sons of Ammon, and he turned again with all his people into Jerusalem. 
After these things, a battle was made in Gezer against Philistines, wherein Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai of the kin of Rephaim, that is, of the kind of giants, and he meeked them. 
Also another battle was done against the Philistines, in which a man given of God, the son of the forest, a man of Bethlehem, killed Goliath of Gath, the brother of giants, of whose shaft, or spear, the wood was as the beam of webs. 
But also another battle befelled in Gath, in which a full long man was, having six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, that is, altogether four and twenty, and he was begotten of the generation of Rephaim, that is, of the giants; 
and he blasphemed Israel, and Jonathan, the son of Shimea, brother of David, killed him. 
These be the sons of Rephaim in Gath, that felled down in the hand of David, and of his servants.
