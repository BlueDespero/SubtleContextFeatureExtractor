Chapter 124.
The song of degrees of David. Israel say now, No but for the Lord was in us; 
no but for the Lord was in us. When men rose up against us; 
in hap they had swallowed us quick. When the strong vengeance of them was wroth against us; 
in hap water had swallowed us up. Our soul passed through a strand or stream; 
in hap our soul had passed through a water unsufferable. 
Blessed be the Lord; that gave not us into taking or catching of the teeth of them. 
Our soul, as a sparrow, is delivered; from the snare of hunters. The snare is all-broken; and we be delivered. 
Our help is in the name of the Lord; that made heaven and earth.
