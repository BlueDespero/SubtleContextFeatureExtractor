JONAH.
Chapter 2.
And Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the fish’s womb, 
and said, I cried to God of my tribulation, and he heard me; from the womb of hell I cried, and thou heardest my voice. 
Thou castedest me down into deepness, in the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me about; all thy swells and thy waves passed on me. 
And I said, I am cast away from the sight of thine eyes; nevertheless again I shall see thine holy temple. 
Waters encompassed me till to my soul, deepness environed me, the seaweed covered mine head. 
I went down to the uttermost places of hills, the bars of earth enclosed me altogether, into without end; and thou, my Lord God, shalt raise up my life from corruption. 
When my soul was anguished in me, I bethought on the Lord, that my prayer come to thee, to thine holy temple. 
They that keep vanities, forsake their mercy idly. 
But I in voice of praising shall offer to thee; whatever things I vowed, I shall yield to the Lord, for mine health. 
And the Lord said to the fish, and it casted out Jonah on/to the dry land.
