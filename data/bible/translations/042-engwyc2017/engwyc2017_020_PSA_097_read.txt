Chapter 97.
The Lord hath reigned, the earth make full out joy; many isles be glad. 
Cloud and darkness in his compass; rightfulness or rightwiseness and doom isthe amending or correction of his seat. 
Fire shall go before him; and shall enflame, either set afire, his enemies in compass. 
His lightnings shined to the world; the earth saw, and was moved. 
Hills as wax floated or flowed down from the face of the Lord; all earth from the face of the Lord. 
Heavens told his rightfulness or rightwiseness; and all peoples saw his glory. 
All they that worship graven things, or images, be shamed, and they that have glory in their simu-lacra; all ye angels of the Lord, worship him. 
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah made full out joy, for thy dooms, Lord. 
For thou, Lord, art the highest on all earth; thou art greatly enhanced over all gods. 
Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; the Lord keepeth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of the sinner. 
Light is risen to the rightful or rightwise man; and gladness to rightful men of heart. 
Just or rightwise men, be ye glad in the Lord; and acknowledge ye to the mind of his hallowing.
