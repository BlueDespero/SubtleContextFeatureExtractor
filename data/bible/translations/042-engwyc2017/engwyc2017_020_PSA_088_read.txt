PSALMS.
Chapter 88.
The song of the psalm, to the sons of Korah, to victory on Mahalath, for to answer the learning of Heman the Ezrahite. Lord God of mine health; I cried in day and night before thee. 
My prayer enter before thy sight; bow down thine ear to my prayer. 
For my soul is full-filled with evils; and my life nighed to hell. 
I am guessed with them that go down into the pit; I am made as a man without help, 
and free among dead men. As men wounded sleeping in sepulchres, of which men none thou is mindful of after; and they be put away from thine hand. 
They have put me in the lower pit; in dark places, and in the shadow of death. 
Thy strong vengeance is confirmed on me; and thou hast brought in all thy waves on me. 
Thou hast made far from me my known; they have set or put me abom-ination to themselves. I am taken in, and I went not out; 
mine eyes were sick or enfeebled for poverty. Lord, I cried to thee; all day I spreaded abroad mine hands to thee. 
Whether thou shalt do marvels to dead men; either leeches shall raise them up, and they shall acknowledge to thee? 
Whether any man in sepulchre shall tell thy mercy; and thy truth in perdition? 
Whether thy marvels shall be known in darknesses; and thy right-fulness or rightwiseness in the land of forgetting? 
And, Lord, I cried to thee; and early my prayer shall before come to thee. 
Lord, why puttest thou away my prayer; thou turnest away thy face from me? 
I am poor, and in travails from my youth; soothly I am enhanced, and I am made low, and troubled. 
Thy wraths passed on me; and thy dreads troubled me. 
They encompassed me as water all day; they encompassed me altogether. 
Thou madest far from me a friend and neighbour; and my known from wretchedness.
