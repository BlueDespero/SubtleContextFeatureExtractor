JOB.
Chapter 35.
Therefore Elihu spake again, these things, 
Whether thy thought seemeth even, either rightful, to thee, that thou should-est say, I am right-fuller or more right-wise than God? 
For thou saidest, That, that is good, pleaseth not thee; either what profit-eth it to thee, if I do sin? 
Therefore I shall answer to thy words, and to thy friends with thee. 
See thou, and behold heaven, and behold thou the air, and know that God is higher than thou. Behold heaven, and look, and mindfully see the clouds, that is higher than thou. 
If thou sinnest, what shalt thou annoy him? and if thy wickednesses be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him? 
Certainly if thou doest justly or rightwisely, what shalt thou give to him; either what shall he take of thine hand? 
Thy wickedness shall annoy a man, which is like thee; and thy right-wiseness shall help the son of a man. 
Men shall cry for the multitude of false challengers, and they shall wail for the violence of the power of tyrants. 
And Job said not, Where is God, that made me, and that gave songs in the night? 
And the which teacheth us above the beasts of the earth, and he shall teach us above the birds of heaven. 
There they shall cry, and God shall not hear them, for the pride of evil men. 
For God shall not hear without cause, and Almighty God shall behold the causes of each man. 
Yea, when thou sayest, He behold-eth not; be thou deemed before him, and abide thou him. 
For now the Lord bringeth not in his strong vengeance, neither he avengeth felonies greatly here. 
Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowing.
