ISAIAH.
Chapter 31.
Woe to them that go down into Egypt to help, and hope in horses, and have trust on carts, for they be many, and on knights, for they be full strong; and they trust not on the Holy of Israel, and they sought not the Lord. 
Forsooth he that is wise, hath brought evil, and took not away his words; and he shall rise altogether against the house of worst men, and against the help of them that work wickedness. 
Egypt is a man, and not God; and the horses of them be flesh, and not spirit; and the Lord shall bow down his hand, and the helper shall fall down, and he shall fall, to whom help is given, and all shall be wasted together, 
For why the Lord saith these things to me, If a lion roareth, and a whelp of a lion on his prey, when the multitude of shepherds cometh against him, he shall not dread of the voice of them, and he shall not dread of the multitude of them; so the Lord of hosts shall come down, for to fight on the mountain or mount of Zion, and on the little hill thereof. 
As birds flying, so the Lord of hosts shall defend Jerusalem; he defending and delivering, passing forth and saving. 
Ye sons of Israel, be converted, as ye had gone away into depth. 
Forsooth in that day a man shall cast away the idols of his silver, and the idols of his gold, which your hands made to you into sin. 
And Assur shall fall by sword, not of man; and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; and he shall flee, not from the face of the sword, and his young men shall be tributaries; 
and the strength of him shall pass from fearedfulness, and his princes fleeing shall dread. The Lord said, whose fire is in Zion, and his chimney is in Jerusalem.
