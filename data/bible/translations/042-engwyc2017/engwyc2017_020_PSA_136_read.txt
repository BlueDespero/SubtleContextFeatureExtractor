Chapter 136.
Alleluia. Acknowledge ye to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy is without end. 
Acknowledge ye to the God of gods. 
Acknowledge ye to the Lord of lords. 
Which alone maketh great marvels. 
Which made heavens by under-standing. 
Which made steadfast the earth on waters. 
Which made great lights. 
The sun into the power of the day. 
The moon and the stars into the power of the night. 
Which smote Egypt with the first engendered things of them. 
Which led out Israel from the midst of them. 
In a mighty hand, and in an high arm. 
Which parted the Red Sea into partings. 
And led out Israel through the midst thereof. 
And he cast adown Pharaoh and his power, or virtue, in the Red Sea. 
Which led over his people through the desert. 
Which smote great kings. 
And killed strong kings. 
Sihon, the king of Amorites. 
And Og, the king of Bashan. 
And he gave the land of them to be heritage. 
Heritage to Israel, his servant. 
For in our lowness he had mind on us. 
And he again-bought us from our enemies. 
Which giveth meat to each flesh. 
Acknowledge ye to the God of heaven. Acknowledge ye to the Lord of lords; for his mercy is without end.
