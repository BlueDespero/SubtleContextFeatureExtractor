Chapter 132.
The song of degrees. Lord, have thou mind on David; and of all his mildness. 
As he swore to the Lord; he made a vow to the God of Jacob. 
I shall not enter into the taber-nacle of mine house; I shall not ascend or go up into the bed of my resting. 
I shall not give sleep to mine eyes; and napping to mine eyelids. 
And rest to my temples, till I find a place to the Lord; a tabernacle to the God of Jacob. 
Lo! we heard that the ark of the testament is in Ephratah or we have heard of it in Ephratah; we found it in the fields of the wood. 
We shall enter into the tabernacle of him; we shall worship in the place, where his feet stood. 
Lord, rise thou into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thine hallowing. 
Thy priests be clothed with right-fulness or rightwiseness; and thy saints make full out joy. 
For David, thy servant; turn thou not away the face of thy christ. 
The Lord swore in truth to David, and he shall not make him in vain; Of the fruit of thy womb I shall set on thy seat. 
If thy sons shall keep my testament; and my witnessings, these which I shall teach them. And the sons of them till into the world; they shall set on thy seat. 
For the Lord chose Zion; he chose it into a dwelling to himself. 
This is my rest into the world of world; I shall dwell here, for I chose it. 
I blessing shall bless the widow of it; I shall ful fill with loaves the poor men of it. 
I shall clothe with health the priests thereof; and the holy men thereof shall make full out joy in full out joying or rejoicing. 
Thither I shall bring forth the horn of David; I have made ready a lantern to my christ. 
I shall clothe his enemies with shame; but mine hallowing shall flower out on him.
