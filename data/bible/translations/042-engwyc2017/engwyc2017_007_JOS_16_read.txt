JOSHUA.
Chapter 16.
And the lot, either part, of the sons of Joseph felled from Jordan against Jericho, and to the waters thereof, from the east; is, the wilder-ness, that goeth up from Jericho to the hill of Bethel, 
and it goeth out from Bethel into Luz, and it passeth the term of Archi to Ataroth, 
and it goeth down to the west, beside the term of Japhleti, unto the terms of the lower Bethhoron, and of Gezer; and the countries thereof be ended with the great sea, 
which countries Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, wielded. 
And the term of the sons of Ephraim, by their meines, and the possession of them was made against the east, Atarothaddar till to the higher Bethhoron. 
And the coasts go out into the sea; for Michmethah beholdeth the north, and it compasseth the terms against the east in Taanathshiloh, and it passeth from the strand or stream of Janohah; 
and it goeth down from Janohah into Atarothaddar, and into Naarath, and it cometh into Jericho; and it goeth out to Jordan 
from Tappuah, and passeth against the sea into the valley of the place of reeds; and the goings out thereof be unto the saltiest sea. This is the possession of the lineage of the sons of Ephraim, by their meines; 
and the cities and the towns of those or them be separated to the sons of Ephraim, in the midst of the possession of the sons of Manasseh. 
And the sons of Ephraim killed not Canaanites, that dwelled in Gezer; and Canaanites dwelled tributary in the midst of Ephraim till to this day.
