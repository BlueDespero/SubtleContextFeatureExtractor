PSALMS.
Chapter 66.
To victory, the song ofthepsalm. All the earth, make ye joy heartily to God, 
say ye psalm to his name; give ye glory to his praising. 
Say ye to God, Lord, thy works be full dreadful; in the multitude of thy virtue thine enemies shall lie down to thee. 
God, all the earth worship thee, and sing to thee; say it psalm to thy name. 
Come ye and see ye the works of God; fearedful in counsels on the sons of men. 
Which turned the sea into dry land; in the flood they shall pass through with foot, there we shall be glad in him. 
The which is Lord in his virtue without end, his eyes behold on folks; they that make sharp be not enhanced in themselves. 
Ye heathen men, bless our God; and make ye heard the voice of his praising. 
That hath set my soul to life, and gave not my feet into stirring. 
For thou, God, hast proved us; thou hast examined us by fire, as silver is examined. 
Thou leddest us into a snare, thou puttedest tribulations in our back; 
thou settedest or puttest men on our heads. We passed by or through fire and water; and thou leddest us out into refreshing. 
I shall enter into thine house in burnt sacrifices; I shall yield to thee my vows, 
which my lips spake distinctly. And my mouth spake in my tribulation; 
I shall offer to thee burnt sacrifices full of marrow, with the burning of rams; I shall offer to thee oxes or oxen with bucks of goats. 
All ye that dread God, come and hear, and I shall tell; how great things he hath done to my soul. 
I cried to him with my mouth; and I joyed fully or full out joyed under my tongue. 
If I beheld wickedness in mine heart; the Lord shall not hear. 
Therefore God heard; and he per-ceived the voice of my beseeching. 
Blessed be God; that removed not my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
