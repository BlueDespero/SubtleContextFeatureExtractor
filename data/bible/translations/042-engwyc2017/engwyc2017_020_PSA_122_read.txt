Chapter 122.
The song of degrees of David. I am glad in these things, that be said to me; We shall go into the house of the Lord. 
Our feet were standing; in thy halls or foreyards, thou Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem, which is builded as a city; whose partaking thereof is into the same thing. 
For the lineages, the lineages of the Lord, ascended or went up thither, the witnessing of Israel; to acknowl-edge to the name of the Lord. 
For they sat there on seats in doom; seats on the house of David. 
Pray ye those things, that be to the peace of Jerusalem; and abundance be to them that love thee. 
Peace be made in thy strength; and abundance in thy towers. 
For my brethren and my neigh-bours; I spake peace of thee. 
For the house of our Lord God; I sought goods to thee.
