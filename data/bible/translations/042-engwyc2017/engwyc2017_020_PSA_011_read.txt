Chapter 11.
To the victory, the psalmof David. I trust in the Lord; how say ye to my soul, Pass thou over into the hill, as a sparrow doeth? 
For lo! sinners have bent a bow; they have made ready their arrows in an arrow case; that they shoot in darkness the rightful men in heart. 
For they have destroyed, whom thou hast made perfect; but what did the rightful or rightwise man? 
The Lord is in his holy temple; he is Lord, his seat is in heaven. His eyes behold on the poor man; his eyelids ask the sons of men. 
The Lord asketh a just or right-wise man, and an unfaithful man; but he, that loveth wickedness, hateth his soul. 
He shall rain snares upon sinners; fire, and brimstone, and the spirit of tempests be the part of the cup of them. 
For the Lord is just or rightwise, and loveth rightfulnesses or rightwise-ness; his cheer hath seen evenness, or equity.
