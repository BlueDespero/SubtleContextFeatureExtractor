HOSEA.
Chapter 1.
The word of the Lord that was made to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Jehoash, the king of Israel. 
The beginning of the speaking to the Lord in Hosea. And the Lord said to Hosea, Go thou, take to thee a wife of fornications, and make to thee sons of fornications, for the land doing fornication shall do fornication, going away from the Lord. 
And he went, and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and childed a son to him. 
And the Lord said to him, Call thou the name of him Jezreel; for yet a little, and I shall visit the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and I shall make to rest the realm of the house of Israel. 
And in that day, I shall all-break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 
And she conceived yet, and childed a daughter. And the Lord said to him, Call thou the name of her Without mercy, for I shall no more lay to, for to have mercy on the house of Israel, but by forgetting I shall forget them. 
And I shall have mercy on the house of Judah, and I shall save them in their Lord God; and I shall not save them in bow, and sword, and battle, and in horses, and in horsemen, either knights. 
And she weaned her that was Without mercy. And she conceived, and childed a son to him. 
And he said, Call thou his name Not my people, for ye shall not be my people, and I shall not be your God. 
And the number of the sons of Israel shall be as gravel of the sea, which gravel is without measure, and it shall not be numbered; and it shall be in the place, where it shall be said to them, Ye be not my people; it shall be said to them, Ye be the sons of God living. 
And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall set one head to themselves, and they shall go up from the earth, for the day of Jezreel is great.
