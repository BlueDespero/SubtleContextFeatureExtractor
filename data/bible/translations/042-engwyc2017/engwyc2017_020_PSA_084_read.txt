Chapter 84.
To victory, on the pressersor wine presses. The psalm of the sons of Korah. Lord of virtues, thy taber-nacles be greatly loved; 
my soul coveteth, and faileth into the porches of the Lord. Mine heart, and my flesh; full out joyed into quick God or God alive. 
For why a sparrow findeth an house to itself; and a turtle findeth a nest to itself, where it shall keep his birds. Lord of virtues, thine altars; my king, and my God. 
Lord, blessed be they that dwell in thine house; they shall praise thee into the worlds of worlds. 
Blessed is the man, whose help is of thee; he hath ordained thy goings in his heart, 
in the valley of tears, in the place which he hath set. For the giver of the law shall give blessing, 
they shall go from virtue into virtue to strength; God of gods shall be seen in Zion. 
Lord God of virtues, hear thou my prayer; God of Jacob, perceive thou with ears. 
God, our defender, behold thou; and behold into the face of thy christ or thine anointed. 
For why one day in thine halls is better; than a thousand elsewhere. I choose to be abject, either an outcast, in the house of my God; more than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners. 
For God loveth mercy and truth; the Lord shall give grace and glory. He shall not deprive them from goods, that go in innocence; 
Lord of virtues, blessed is the man, that hopeth in thee.
