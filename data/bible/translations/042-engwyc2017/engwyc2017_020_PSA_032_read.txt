Chapter 32.
Learning to David. The under-standing of David. Blessed be they, whose wickedness be forgiven; and whose sins be covered. 
Blessed is the man, to whom the Lord areckoned not sin; neither guile is in his spirit. 
For I was still, my bones waxed eld; while I cried all day. 
For by day and night thine hand was made grievous on me; I am turned in my wretchedness, while the thorn is set in. 
I made my sin known to thee; and I hid not my unrightfulness. I said, I shall acknowledge against me mine unrightfulness to the Lord; and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin. 
For this thing each holy man shall pray to thee; in covenable time. Nevertheless in the great flood of many waters; they shall not nigh to thee. 
Thou art my refuge from tribulation, that encompassed me; thou, my fully joying or full out joy, deliver me from them that encompass me. 
I shall give understanding to thee, and I shall teach thee; in this way in which thou shalt go, I shall make steadfast mine eyes on thee. 
Do not ye be made as an horse and mule; to which is none under-standing. Lord, constrain thou the cheeks of them with a barnacle and bridle; that they nigh not to thee. 
Many beatings be of the sinner; but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord. 
Ye just or rightwise men, be glad, and make fully joy in the Lord; and all ye rightful of heart, have glory.
