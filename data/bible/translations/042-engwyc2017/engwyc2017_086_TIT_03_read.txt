TITUS.
Chapter 3.
Admonish them to be subjects or to be subject to princes, and to powers; to obey to that that is said, and to be ready to all good work; 
to blaspheme no man, to be not full of chiding, but temperate or patient, showing all mildness to all men. 
For we were sometime unwise, unbelieveful, erring, and serving to desires, and to diverse lusts, doing in malice and envy, worthy to be hated, hating each other. 
But when the benignity and the manhood or the humanity of our Saviour God appeared, 
not of works of rightwiseness that we did, but by his mercy he made us safe, by the washing, or baptism, of again-begetting, and again-newing of the Holy Ghost, 
whom he shedded out into us plenteously by Jesus Christ, our Saviour, 
that we justified by his grace, be heirs by hope of everlasting life. 
A true word is this, and of these things I will that thou confirm others, that they that believe in God, be busy to be above or to be before others in good works. These things be good, and profitable to men. 
And eschew thou foolish questions, and genealogies, and strivings or strives, and fightings of the law; for those be unprofitable and vain. 
Eschew or Shun thou a man heretic, after one and the second correction; 
witting that he that is such a manner man is subverted, and trespasseth, and is condemned by his own doom. 
When I send to thee Artemas, or Tychicus, hie thou or haste to come to me to Nicopolis; for I have purposed to dwell in winter there. 
Busily before send or send before Zenas, a wise man of law, and Apollos, that nothing fail to them. 
They that be of ours, learn to be governors or to be before in good works, to necessary uses, that they be not without fruit. 
All men that be with me greet thee well. Greet thou well them, that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.
