Chapter 21.
To victory, the psalm of David. Lord, the king shall be glad in thy virtue; and he shall full out have joy greatly on thine health. 
Thou hast given to him the desire of his heart; and thou hast not defrauded him of the will of his lips. 
For thou hast before-come him in the blessings of sweetness; thou hast set or puttest on his head a crown of precious stone. 
He asked of thee life, and thou gavest it to him; the length of days into the world, and into the world of world. 
His glory is great in thine health; thou shalt put glory, and great fairness, on him. 
For thou shalt give him into bless-ing into the world of world; thou shalt make him glad in joy with thy cheer. 
For the king hopeth in the Lord; and in the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved. 
Thine hand be found to all thine enemies; thy right hand find all them that hate thee. 
Thou shalt put them as a furnace of fire in the time of thy cheer; the Lord shall trouble them in his ire, and fire shall devour them. 
Thou shalt lose the fruit of them from the earth; and the seed of them from the sons of men. 
For they bowed evil against thee; they thought counsels, which they might not stablish. 
For thou shalt put them aback; in thy remnants thou shalt make ready the cheer of them. 
Lord, be thou enhanced in thy virtue; we shall sing, and say openly thy virtues.
