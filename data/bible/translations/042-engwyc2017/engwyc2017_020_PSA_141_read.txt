Chapter 141.
The psalm of David. Lord, I cried to thee, hear thou me; give thou attention to my voice, when I shall cry to thee. 
My prayer be dressed as incense in thy sight; the raising up of mine hands be as the eventide sacrifice. 
Lord, set thou a keeping to my mouth; and a door of standing about to my lips. 
Bow thou not down mine heart into words of malice; to excuse excusings in sin. With men working wickedness; and I shall not commune with the chosen men of them. 
A just or rightwise man shall reprove me in mercy, and he shall blame me; but the oil of a sinner make not fat mine head. For why and yet my prayer is in the well pleasant or well pleased things of them; 
for the doomsmen of them joined to the stone were sopped up. Hear they my words, for they were mighty. 
As fatness is broken out on the earth; our bones be scattered nigh hell. 
Lord, Lord, for mine eyes be to thee, I hoped in thee; take thou not away my soul. 
Keep thou me from the snare which they ordained to me; and from the traps of them that work wickedness. 
Sinners shall fall in the net thereof; I am alone till I pass by.
