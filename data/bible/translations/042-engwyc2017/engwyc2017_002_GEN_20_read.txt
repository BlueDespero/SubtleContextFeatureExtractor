GENESIS.
Chapter 20.
Abraham went forth from thence into the land of the south, and dwelled betwixt Kadesh and Shur, and was a pilgrim in Gerar; 
and he said of Sarah, his wife, She is my sister. Therefore Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent, and took her. 
Soothly God came to Abimelech by a sweven in the night, and said to him, Lo! thou shalt die, for the woman which thou hast taken, for she hath an husband. 
Forsooth Abimelech had touched not her; and he said, Lord, whether thou shalt slay a folk unknowing and just or rightwise? 
Whether he said not to me, She is my sister, and she said, He is my brother? In the simpleness of mine heart, and in the cleanness of mine hands, I did this. 
And the Lord said to him, And I know that thou didest by simple heart, and therefore I kept thee, lest thou didest sin against me, and I suffered not that thou touchedest her; 
now therefore yield thou the wife to her husband, for he is a prophet; and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; soothly if thou wilt not yield her, know thou that thou shalt die by death, thou, and all things that be thine. 
And at once Abimelech rose by night, and called all his servants, and spake all these words in the ears of them; and all men dreaded greatly. 
Soothly Abimelech called also Abraham, and said to him, What hast thou done to us? what sinned we against thee, that thou hast brought in on me and on my realm such a great sin? thou hast done to us which things thou oughtest not to do. 
And again Abimelech asked, and said, What thing sawest thou, that thou wouldest do this? 
Abraham answered, I thought within me, and said, In hap the dread of God is not in this place; and they shall slay me for my wife; 
in other manner forsooth and she is my sister verily, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother; and I wedded her into wife; 
soothly after that God led me out of the house of my father, I said to her, Thou shalt do this mercy with me in each place to which we shall enter; thou shalt say, that I am thy brother. 
Therefore Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and servants, and handmaids, and gave to Abraham; and he yielded to him Sarah, his wife, 
and said, The land is before you; dwell thou, wherever it pleaseth thee. 
Forsooth Abimelech said to Sarah, Lo! I gave a thousand pieces of silver to thy brother; this shall be to thee into a covering of eyes, to all men that be with thee; and whither ever thou goest, have thou mind that thou art taken. 
Soothly for Abraham prayed, God cured Abimelech, and his wife, and handmaids, and they childed; 
for God had closed each womb of the house of Abimelech, for Sarah, the wife of Abraham.
