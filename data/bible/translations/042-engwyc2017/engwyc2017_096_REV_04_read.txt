APOCALYPSE of JOHN.
Chapter 4.
After these things I saw, and lo! a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice that I heard, was as of a trump speaking with me, and said, Go thou up hither, and I shall show to thee which things it behooveth to be done soon after these things. 
And anon I was in Spirit, and lo! a seat was set in heaven, and upon the seat one sitting. 
And he that sat, was like the sight of a stone jasper, and to sardine; and a rainbow was in the compass of the seat, like the sight of emerald. 
And in the compass of the seat were four and twenty small seats; and above or upon the thrones four and twenty elder men sitting, covered about with white clothes, and in the heads of them golden crowns. 
And lightnings, and voices, and thunderings came out of the throne; and seven lamps burning before the throne, which be the seven spirits of God. 
And before the seat as a sea of glass, like crystal, and in the middle of the seat, and in the compass of the seat, were four beasts, full of eyes before and behind. 
And the first beast like a lion; and the second beast like a calf; and the third beast having a face as of a man; and the fourth beast like an eagle flying. 
And the four beasts had each of them six wings; and all about and within they were full of eyes; and they had not rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God almighty, that was, and that is, and that is to coming or is to come. 
And when those four beasts gave glory, and honour, and blessing to him that sat on the throne, that liveth into worlds of worlds, 
the four and twenty elder men fell down before him that sat on the throne, and worshipped him that liveth into worlds of worlds. And they cast their crowns before the throne, and said, 
Thou, Lord our God, art worthy to take glory, and honour, and virtue; for thou madest of nought all things, and for thy will those were, and be made of nought.
