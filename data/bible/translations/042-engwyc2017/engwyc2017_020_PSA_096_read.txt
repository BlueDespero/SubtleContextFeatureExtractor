Chapter 96.
Sing ye a new song to the Lord; all earth, sing ye to the Lord. 
Sing ye to the Lord, and bless ye his name; tell ye his health from day into day. 
Tell ye his glory among heathen men; his marvels among all peoples. 
For the Lord is great, and worthy to be praised full much; he is feared-ful above all gods. 
For all the gods of heathen men be fiends; but the Lord made heavens. 
Acknowledging and fairness is in his sight; holiness and worthy doing is in his hallowing. 
Ye countries of heathen men, bring to the Lord, bring ye glory and honour to the Lord; 
bring ye to the Lord glory to his name. Take ye sacrifices, and enter ye into the halls of him; 
praise ye the Lord in his holy hall. All earth be moved of his face; 
say ye among heathen men, that the Lord hath reigned. And he hath amended the world, that shall not be moved; he shall deem peoples in equity. 
Heavens be glad, and the earth make full out joy, the sea and the fullness thereof be moved altogether; 
fields shall make joy, and all things that be in those or them. Then all the trees of woods shall make full out joy, 
for the face of the Lord, for he cometh; for he cometh to deem the earth. He shall deem the world in equity; and peoples in his truth.
