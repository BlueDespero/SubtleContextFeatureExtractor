PSALMS.
Chapter 143.
The psalm of David. Lord, hear thou my prayer, with ears perceive thou my beseeching; in thy truth hear thou me, in thy rightwiseness. 
And enter thou not into doom with thy servant; for each man living shall not be made just or justified in thy sight. 
For the enemy pursued my soul; he made low my life in the earth. He hath set me in dark places, as the dead men of the world, 
and my spirit was anguished on me; mine heart was troubled in me. 
I was mindful of eld or old days, I bethought in all thy works; I be-thought in the deeds of thine hands. 
I held forth mine hands to thee; my soul was as earth without water to thee. 
Lord, hear thou me swiftly; my spirit failed. Turn thou not away thy face from me; and I shall be like them that go down into the pit. 
Make thou early thy mercy heard to me; for I hoped in thee. Make thou known to me the way in which I shall go; for I raised my soul to thee. 
Deliver thou me from mine enemies; Lord, I fled to thee; 
teach thou me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Thy good spirit shall lead me forth into a rightful or right land; 
Lord, for thy name thou shalt quicken me in thine equity. Thou shalt lead my soul out of tribulation; 
and in thy mercy thou shalt scatter mine enemies. And thou shalt lose all them, that trouble my soul; for I am thy servant.
