Chapter 103.
A psalm of David. My soul, bless thou the Lord, and all things that be within me, bless his holy name. 
My soul, bless thou the Lord; and do not thou forget all the yieldings of him. 
Which doeth mercy to all thy wickednesses; which healeth all thy sicknesses. 
Which again-buyeth thy life from death; which crowneth thee in mercy and merciful doings. 
Which ful filleth thy desire in goods; thy youth shall be renewed as the youth of an eagle. 
The Lord doing mercies; and doom, to all men suffering wrong. 
He made his ways known to Moses; his wills or deeds to the sons of Israel. 
The Lord is a merciful doer, and merciful in will; long abiding, and much merciful. 
He shall not be wroth without end; and he shall not threaten without end. 
He did not to us after our sins; neither he yielded to us after our wickednesses. 
For by the highness of heaven from earth; he made strong his mercy on men dreading him. 
As much as the east is from the west; he made a far our wicked-nesses from us. 
As a father hath mercy on his sons, the Lord had mercy on men dreading him; 
for he knew our making. He bethought that we be dust, 
a man is as hay; his days shall flower out so as a flower of the field. 
For the spirit shall pass in him, and it shall not abide; and it shall no more know his place. 
But the mercy of the Lord is from without beginning, and till into with-out end; on men dreading him. And his rightfulness or rightwisenessis into the sons of sons; 
to them that keep his testament. And be mindful of his command-ments; to do those or them. 
The Lord hath made ready his seat in heaven; and his realm shall be lord of all. 
Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; ye mighty in virtue, doing his word, to hear the voice of his words. 
All virtues or hosts of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; ye ministers of him, that do his will. 
All works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord, in each place of his lord-ship; my soul, bless thou the Lord.
