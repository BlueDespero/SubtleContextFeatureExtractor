Chapter 36.
To victory, to Davidor the psalm of David, the servant of the Lord. The unjust man said, that he trespass in himself; the dread of God is not before his eyes. 
For he did guilefully in the sight of God; that his wickedness be found to be hatred. 
The words of his mouth be wickedness and guile; he would not understand to do well. 
He thought wickedness in his bed; he stood nigh all ways not good; forsooth he hated not malice. 
Lord, thy mercy is in heaven; and thy truth is unto the clouds. 
Thy rightfulness or rightwisenessis as the hills of God; thy dooms be as much depth of waters. Lord, thou shalt save men and beasts; 
as thou, God, hast multiplied thy mercy. But the sons of men shall hope in the covering of thy wings. 
They shall be filled greatly of the plenty of thine house; and thou shalt give drink to them of the stiff stream of thy liking or thy delight. 
For the well of life is with thee; and in thy light we shall see light. 
Lord, set forth thy mercy to them that know thee; and thy rightfulness or rightwiseness to them that be of rightful or right heart. 
The foot of pride come not to me; and the hand of the sinner move me not. 
There they have fallen down, that work wickedness; they be cast out, and might not stand.
