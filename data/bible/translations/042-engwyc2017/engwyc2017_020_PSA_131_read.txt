Chapter 131.
The song of degrees to David. Lord, mine heart is not enhanced; neither mine eyes be raised. Neither I went in great things; neither in marvels above me. 
If I feeled not meekly; but I en-hanced my soul. As a child weaned on his mother; so yielding be in my soul. 
Israel, hope in the Lord; from this time now and into the world.
