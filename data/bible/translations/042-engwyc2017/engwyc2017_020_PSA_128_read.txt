Chapter 128.
The song of degrees. Blessed be all men, that dread the Lord; that go in his ways. 
For thou shalt eat the travails of thine hands; thou art blessed, and it shall be well to thee. 
Thy wife shall be as a plenteous vine; in the sides of thine house. Thy sons as the new springs of olive trees; in the compass of thy board. 
Lo! so a man shall be blessed; that dreadeth the Lord. 
The Lord bless thee from Zion; and see thou the goods of Jerusalem in all the days of thy life. 
And see thou the sons of thy sons; see thou peace on Israel.
