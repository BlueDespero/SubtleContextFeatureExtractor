Chapter 59.
To the overcomer, lose thou not the seemly song of David, when Saul sent men and kept the house, to slay him. My God, deliver thou me from mine enemies; and deliver thou me from them that rise against me. 
Deliver thou me from them that work wickedness; and save thou me from men-quellers. 
For lo! they have taken my soul; strong men fell in on me. Neither for my wickedness, neither for my sin; 
Lord, I ran without wickedness, and dressed my works. Rise up into my meeting, and see; 
and thou, Lord God of virtues, art God of Israel. Give thou attention to visit all folks; do thou not mercy to all that work wickedness. 
They shall be turned at eventide, and they as dogs shall suffer hunger; and they shall compass, that is, go abegging in, the city. 
Lo! they shall speak in their mouth, and a sword in their lips; for who heard? 
And thou, Lord, shalt scorn them; thou shalt bring all folks to nought. 
I shall keep my strength to thee; for God is mine up-taker, 
my God, his mercy shall come before me. God showed to me my desire on mine enemies, 
slay thou not them; lest any time my peoples forget. Scatter thou them in thy virtue; and, Lord, my defender, put thou them down. 
Put down the trespass of their mouth, and the word of their lips; and be they taken in their pride. And of cursing and of leasing; they shall be showed in the ending. 
In the ire of ending, and they shall not be; and they shall know, that the Lord shall be Lord of Jacob, and of the ends of earth. 
They shall be turned at eventide, and they as dogs shall suffer hunger; and they shall compass, that is, go abegging in, the city. 
They shall be scattered abroad, for to eat; soothly if they be not ful filled, and they shall grutch. 
But I shall sing of thy strength; and early I shall enhance thy mercy. For thou art made mine up-taker; and my refuge, in the day of my tribulation. 
Mine helper, I shall sing to thee; for thou art God, mine up-taker, my God, my mercy.
