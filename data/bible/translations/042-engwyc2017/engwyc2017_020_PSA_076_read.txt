Chapter 76.
To the victory in organs, the psalm of the song of Asaph. God is known in Judah; his name is great in Israel. 
And his place is made in peace; and his dwelling is in Zion. 
There he brake powers; bow, shield, sword, and battle. 
And thou, God, lightenest wonder-fully coming back from everlasting hills; 
all unwise men of heart were troubled. They slept their sleep, that is, were dead; and all men found nothing of riches in their hands. 
They that ascended or went up on horses; slept for thy blaming, thou God of Jacob. 
Thou art fearful, and who shall against-stand thee? from that time of thine ire. 
From heaven thou madest doom heard; the earth trembled, and rested. 
When God rose up into doom; to make safe all the mild men of earth. 
For the thought of man shall acknowledge to thee; and the remnants or leavings of thought shall make a feast day to thee. 
Make ye a vow, and yield ye to your Lord God; all that bring gifts in the compass of it. To God fearedful, 
and to him that taketh away the spirit of princes; to the fearedful at the kings of earth.
