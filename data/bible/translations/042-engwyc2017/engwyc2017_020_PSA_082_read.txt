Chapter 82.
The psalm of Asaph. God stood in the synagogue of gods; forsooth he deemeth gods in the middle. 
How long deem ye with wicked-ness; and take the faces of sinners? 
Deem ye to the needy man, and to the motherless child; justify ye the meek man and poor. 
Ravish ye out a poor man; and deliver ye a needy man from the hand of the sinner. 
They know not, neither under-stand, they go in darknesses; all the foundaments of the earth shall be moved. 
I said, Ye be gods; and all ye be the sons of the high God. 
But ye shall die as men; and ye shall fall down as one of the princes. 
Rise, thou God, deem thou the earth; for thou shalt have heritage in all folks.
