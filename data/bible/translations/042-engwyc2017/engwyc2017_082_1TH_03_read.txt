1ST THESSALONIANS.
Chapter 3.
For which thing we suffered no longer, and it pleased to us to dwell alone at Athens; 
and we sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God in the evangel of Christ, to you to be confirmed, and to be taught, or admonished, for your faith, 
that no man be moved in these tribulations. For ye yourselves know, that in this thing we be set. 
For when we were at you, we before-said to you, that we should suffer tribulations; as it is done, and ye know. 
Therefore I, Paul, no longer abiding, sent to know your faith, lest peradventure he that tempteth shall tempt you, and your travail or our travail be made vain. 
But now, when Timothy shall come to us from you, and tell to us your faith and charity, and that ye have good mind of us, evermore desiring to see us, as we also you; 
therefore, brethren, we be comforted in you, in all our need and tribulation, by your faith. 
For now we live, if ye stand in the Lord. 
For what doing of thankings may we yield to God for you, in all joy, in which we joy for you before our Lord? 
night and day more plenteously praying, that we see your face, and fulfill those things that fail to or of your faith. 
But God himself and our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, address our way to you. 
And the Lord multiply you, and make your charity to be plenteous of each to other or for to abound together, and into all men, as also we in you; 
that your hearts be confirmed without complaint in holiness, before God and our Father, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. Amen.
