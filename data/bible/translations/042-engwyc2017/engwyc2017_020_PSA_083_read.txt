PSALMS.
Chapter 83.
The song of the psalm of Asaph. God, who shall be like thee? God, be thou not still, neither be thou peaced. 
For lo! thine enemies sounded; and they that hate thee raised the head. 
They made a wicked counsel on thy people; and they thought against thy saints. 
They said, Come ye, and lose we them from the folk; and the name of Israel be no more had in mind. 
For they thought with one accord; 
the tabernacles of Idumeans, and men of Ishmael disposed a testament together against thee. Moab, and Hag-arenes, 
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; and the aliens with them that dwell in Tyre. 
For Assur cometh with them; they be made into help to the sons of Lot. 
Make thou to them as to Midian, and Sisera; as to Jabin, in the strand or stream of Kishon. 
They perished in Endor; they were made as a turd of earth. 
Put thou the princes of them as Oreb and Zeeb; and Zebah and Zalmunna. 
All the princes of them, that said, Hold we by heritage the saintuary of God. 
My God, put thou them as a wheel; and as stubble before the face of the wind. 
As fire that burneth a wood; and as flame burning hills. 
So thou shalt pursue them in thy tempest; and thou shalt trouble them in thine ire. 
Lord, fill thou the faces of them with shame; and they shall seek thy name. 
Be they ashamed, and be they troubled into the world of world; and be they shamed, and perish they. 
And know they, that Lord is name to thee; thou alone art the Highest in every land.
