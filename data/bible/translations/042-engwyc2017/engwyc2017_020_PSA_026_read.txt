PSALMS.
Chapter 26.
The psalm of David. Lord, deem thou me, for I entered in mine inno-cence; and I hoping in the Lord, shall not be made unsteadfast. 
Lord, prove thou me, and assay me; burn thou my reins, and mine heart. 
For why thy mercy is before mine eyes; and I pleased in thy truth. 
I sat not with the counsel of vanity; and I shall not enter with men doing wicked things. 
I hated the church of evil men; and I shall not sit with wicked men. 
I shall wash mine hands among innocents; and, Lord, I shall compass thine altar. 
That I hear the voice of praising; and that I tell out all thy marvels. 
Lord, I have loved the fairness of thine house; and the place of the dwelling of thy glory. 
God, lose thou not my soul with unfaithful men; and my life with men of bloods. 
In whose hands wickednesses be; the right hand of them is full-filled with gifts. 
But I entered in mine innocence; again-buy thou me, and have mercy on me. 
My foot stood in rightfulness; Lord, I shall bless thee in churches.
