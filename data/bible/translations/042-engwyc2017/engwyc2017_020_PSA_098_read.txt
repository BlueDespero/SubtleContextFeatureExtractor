PSALMS.
Chapter 98.
A psalm. Sing ye a new song to the Lord; for he hath done marvels. His right hand and his holy arm; hath made health to him. 
The Lord hath made known his health; in the sight of heathen men he hath showed his rightfulness or right-wiseness. 
He bethought on his mercy; and on his truth, to the house of Israel. All the ends of earth; saw the health of our God. 
All earth, make ye heartily joy to God; sing ye, and make ye full out joy, and say ye psalm. 
Sing ye to the Lord in an harp, in harp and in voice of psalm; 
in trumps beaten out with hammer, and in voice of a trump of horn. Heartily sing ye in the sight of the Lord, the King; 
the sea and the fullness thereof be moved; the world, and they that dwell therein. 
Floods shall make joy with hand; together hills shall make full out joy, 
for the sight of the Lord; for he cometh to deem the earth. He shall deem the world in rightfulness or rightwiseness; and peoples in equity.
