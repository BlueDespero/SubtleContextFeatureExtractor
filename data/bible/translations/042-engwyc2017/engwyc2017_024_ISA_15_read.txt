ISAIAH.
Chapter 15.
The burden of Moab. For Ar was destroyed in night, Moab was still; for the wall was destroyed in the night, Moab was still. 
The king’s house, and Dibon ascended or went up to high places, into wailing; on Nebo, and on Medeba, Moab shall yell. In all heads thereof shall be baldness, and each beard shall be shaved. 
In the meeting of three ways thereof they be girded in a sackcloth, all yelling on the houses thereof, and in the streets thereof; it shall go down into weeping. 
Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh, the voice of them is heard till to Jahaz; on this thing the ready men of Moab shall yell, the soul thereof shall yell to itself. 
Mine heart shall cry to Moab, the bars thereof till to Zoar, a cow calf of three years. For why a weeper shall go up by the going up of Luhith, and in the way of Horonaim they shall raise cry of sorrow or contrition. 
For why the waters of Nimrim shall be forsaken; for the herb dried up, burgeoning failed, all greenness perished. 
By the greatness of work, and the visiting of them, to the strand or stream of sallows they shall lead them. 
For why their cry compassed the end of Moab; till to Eglaim the yelling thereof, and the cry thereof till to the well of Elim. 
For the waters of Dimon be filled with blood; for I shall set increasings on Dimon, to those men of Moab that fled from the lion, and to the remnants of the land.
