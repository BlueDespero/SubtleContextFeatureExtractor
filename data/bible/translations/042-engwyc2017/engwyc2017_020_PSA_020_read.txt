Chapter 20.
To victory, the psalm of David. The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation; the name of God of Jacob defend thee. 
Send he help to thee from the holy place; and from Zion defend he thee. 
Be he mindful of all thy sacrifice; and thy burnt sacrifice be made fat. 
Give he to thee after thine heart; and confirm he all thy counsel. 
We shall be glad in thine health; and we shall be magnified in the name of our God. The Lord ful fill all thine askings; 
now I have known, that the Lord hath made safe his christ. He shall hear him from his holy heaven; the health of his right hand is in powers. 
These, that is, adversaries, trust in chariots, and these in horses; but we shall inwardly call in the name of our Lord God. 
They be bound, and felled down; but we have risen, and be raised. 
Lord, make thou safe the king; and hear thou us in the day in which we inwardly call thee.
