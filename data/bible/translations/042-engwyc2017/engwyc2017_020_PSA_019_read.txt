PSALMS.
Chapter 19.
To victory, the psalm of David. Heavens tell out the glory of God; and the firmament telleth the works of his hands. 
The day telleth out to the day a word; and the night showeth know-ing to the night. 
No languages be, neither words; of which the voices of them be not heard. 
The sound of them went out into all earth; and the words of them into the ends of the world. In the sun he hath set his tabernacle; 
and he as a spouse coming forth of his chamber. He fully joyed, as a giant, to run his way; 
his going out was from the high-est heaven. And his going again was to the highest thereof; and none there is that hideth himself from his heat. 
The law of the Lord is without wem, and converteth souls; the wit-nessing of the Lord is faithful, and giveth wisdom to little, either meek, children. 
The rightfulnesses of the Lord be rightful, gladdening hearts; the com-mandment of the Lord is clear, en-lightening eyes. 
The holy dread of the Lord dwelleth into the world of world; the dooms of the Lord be true, justified into themselves. 
Desirable more than gold, and a stone much precious; and sweeter than honey and honeycomb. 
Forsooth thy servant keepeth those or them; much yielding is in those dooms to be kept. 
Who understandeth trespasses? make thou me clean from my privy sins; 
and of alien sins spare thy servant. If those or they have not lordship of me, then I shall be undefouled of alien sins, or without wem; and I shall be cleansed of the most sin. 
And the speeches of my mouth shall be such, that they please; and the thinking of mine heart is evermore in thy sight. Lord, mine helper; and mine again-buyer.
