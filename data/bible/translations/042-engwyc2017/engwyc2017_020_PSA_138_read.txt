PSALMS.
Chapter 138.
The psalm of David. Lord, I shall acknowledge to thee in all mine heart; for thou heardest the words of my mouth. My God, I shall sing to thee in the sight of angels; 
I shall worship toward thine holy temple, and I shall acknowledge to thy name. On thy mercy and thy truth; for thou hast magnified thine holy name above all things. 
In whatever day I shall inwardly call thee, hear thou me; thou shalt multiply virtue in my soul. 
Lord, all the kings of earth acknowl-edge to thee; for they heard all the words of thy mouth. 
And sing they in the ways of the Lord; for the glory of the Lord is great. 
For the Lord is high, and behold-eth meek things; and knoweth afar high things. 
If I shall go in the midst of tribu-lation, thou shalt quicken me; and thou stretchedest forth thine hand on the ire of mine enemies, and thy right hand made me safe. 
The Lord shall yield for me, Lord, thy mercy is without end; despise thou not the works of thine hands.
