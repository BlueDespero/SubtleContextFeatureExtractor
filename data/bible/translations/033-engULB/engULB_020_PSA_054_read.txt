Psalms.
Chapter 54.
For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “Does David not hide himself with us?” Save me, God, by your name, and judge me in your might. 
Hear my prayer, God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
For strangers have risen up against me, and pitiless men have sought after my life; they have not set God before them. Selah 
See, God is my helper; the Lord is the one who upholds me. 
He will repay my enemies with evil; in your faithfulness, destroy them! 
I will sacrifice to you with a freewill offering; I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good. 
For he has rescued me from every trouble; my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
