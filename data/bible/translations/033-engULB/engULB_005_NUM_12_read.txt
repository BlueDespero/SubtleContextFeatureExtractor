Numbers.
Chapter 12.
Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married. 
They said, “Has Yahweh spoken only with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us?” Now Yahweh heard what they said. 
Now the man Moses was very humble, humbler than anyone else on earth. 
Right away Yahweh spoke to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam: “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them went out. 
Then Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud. He stood at the entrance to the tent and called Aaron and Miriam. They both came forward. 
Yahweh said, “Now listen to my words. When a prophet of mine is with you, I will reveal myself to him in visions and speak to him in dreams. 
My servant Moses is not like that. He is faithful in all my house. 
I speak to Moses directly, not with visions or riddles. He sees my form. So why are you unafraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?” 
Yahweh's anger burned against them, and then he left them. 
The cloud rose from over the tent, and Miriam was suddenly leprous—she was as white as snow. When Aaron turned toward Miriam, he saw that she had leprosy. 
Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my master, please do not hold this sin against us. We have spoken foolishly, and we have sinned. 
Please do not let her be like a dead newborn whose flesh is half consumed when it emerges from its mother's womb.” 
So Moses called out to Yahweh. He said, “Please heal her, God, please.” 
Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, she would be disgraced for seven days. Shut her outside the camp for seven days. After that bring her in again.” 
So Miriam was shut outside the camp for seven days. The people did not journey until she had returned to the camp. 
After that, the people journeyed from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
