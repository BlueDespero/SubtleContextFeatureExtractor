Psalms.
Chapter 52.
For the chief musician. A maschil of David; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, “David has come to the house of Ahimelech.” Why are you proud of making trouble, you mighty man? The covenant faithfulness of God comes every day. 
Your tongue plans destruction like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 
You love evil more than good and lying rather than speaking righteousness. Selah 
You love all words that devour others, you deceitful tongue. 
God will likewise destroy you forever; he will take you up and pluck you out of your tent and root you out of the land of the living. Selah 
The righteous will also see it and fear; they will laugh at him and say, 
“See, this is a man who did not make God his refuge, but he trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and he was strong when he destroyed others.” 
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house; I will trust in the covenant faithfulness of God forever and ever. 
I will give you thanks forever for what you have done. I will wait for your name, because it is good, in the presence of your godly people.
