Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Praise Yahweh. Praise him, you servants of Yahweh; praise the name of Yahweh. 
Blessed be the name of Yahweh, both now and forevermore. 
From the rising of the sun to its setting, Yahweh's name should be praised. 
Yahweh is exalted above all nations, and his glory reaches above the skies. 
Who is like Yahweh our God, who has his seat on high, 
who looks down at the sky and at the earth? 
He raises up the poor out of the dirt and lifts up the needy from the ash heap, 
so that he may seat him with princes, with the princes of his people. 
He gives a home to the barren woman of the house, he makes her a joyful mother of children. Praise Yahweh!
