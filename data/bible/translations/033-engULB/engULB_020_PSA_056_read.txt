Psalms.
Chapter 56.
For the chief musician; set to Jonath elem rehokim. A psalm of David. A michtam; when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful to me, God, for men are attacking me! All the day long those who fight me press their assault. 
My enemies trample me all day long; for there are many who arrogantly fight against me. 
When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you. 
In God, whose word I praise— in God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid; what can mere man do to me? 
All the day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, and they mark my steps, just as they have waited for my life. 
Do not let them escape doing iniquity. Bring down the peoples in your anger, God. 
You number my wanderings and put my tears into your bottle; are they not in your book? 
Then my enemies will turn back on the day that I call to you; this I know, that God is for me. 
In God—whose word I praise, in Yahweh—whose word I praise, 
in God I trust, I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me? 
The duty to fulfill my vows to you is on me, God; I will give thank offerings to you. 
For you have rescued my life from death; you have kept my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
