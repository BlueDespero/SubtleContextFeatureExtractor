Psalms.
Chapter 63.
A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. God, you are my God! I earnestly search for you, my soul thirsts for you, and my flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water. 
So I have looked on you in the sanctuary, to see your power and your glory. 
Because your covenant faithfulness is better than life, my lips will praise you. 
So I will bless you while I live; I will lift up my hands in your name. 
It will be as if I ate a meal of marrow and fatness; with joyful lips my mouth will praise you, 
when I think about you on my bed and meditate on you in the night hours. 
For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I rejoice. 
I cling to you; your right hand supports me. 
But those who seek to destroy my life will go down into the lowest parts of the earth; 
they will be given over to those whose hands use the sword, and they will become food for the jackals. 
But the king will rejoice in God; everyone who swears by him will be proud of him, but the mouth of those who speak lies will be stopped up.
