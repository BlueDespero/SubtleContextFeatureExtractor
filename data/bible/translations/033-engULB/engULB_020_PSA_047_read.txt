Psalms.
Chapter 47.
For the chief musician. A psalm of the sons of Korah. Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with the sound of triumph. 
For Yahweh Most High is terrifying; he is a great King over all the earth. 
He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet. 
He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah 
God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
For God is the King over all the earth; sing praises with understanding. 
God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne. 
The princes of the peoples have gathered together to the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.
