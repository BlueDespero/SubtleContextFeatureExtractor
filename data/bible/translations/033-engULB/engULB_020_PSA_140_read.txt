Psalms.
Chapter 140.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David. Yahweh, rescue me from the wicked; preserve me from violent men. 
They plan evil in their hearts; they cause battles every day. 
Their tongues wound like serpents; vipers' poison is on their lips. Selah 
Keep me from the hands of the wicked, Yahweh; preserve me from violent men who plan to knock me over. 
The proud have set a trap for me; they have spread a net; they have set a snare for me. Selah 
I said to Yahweh, “You are my God; listen to my cries for mercy.” 
Yahweh, my Lord, you are powerfully able to save me; you shield my head in the day of battle. 
Yahweh, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not let their plots succeed. Selah 
Those who surround me raise their heads; let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
Let burning coals fall on them; throw them into the fire, into bottomless pits, never more to rise. 
May men of tongues not be made secure on the earth; may evil hunt down the violent man to strike him dead. 
I know that Yahweh will judge in favor of the afflicted, and that he will give justice to the needy. 
Surely the righteous people will give thanks to your name; the upright people will live in your presence.
