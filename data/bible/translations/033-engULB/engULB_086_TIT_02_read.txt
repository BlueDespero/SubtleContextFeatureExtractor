Titus.
Chapter 2.
But you, speak what fits with faithful instruction. 
Teach older men to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance. 
Teach older women likewise to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or being slaves to much wine, but to be teachers of what is good. 
In this way they may train the younger women to love their own husbands and children, 
to be sensible, pure, good housekeepers, and obedient to their own husbands. They should do these things so that God's word may not be insulted. 
In the same way, encourage the younger men to use good sense. 
In all ways present yourself as an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, dignity, 
and a correct message, so that anyone who opposes you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us. 
Teach slaves to obey their masters in everything, to please them and not argue with them, 
to not steal from them, but instead to demonstrate all good faith, so that in every way they may bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior. 
For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all people. 
It trains us to reject godlessness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this age, 
while we look forward to receiving our blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. 
Jesus gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to make pure, for himself, a special people who are eager to do good works. 
Speak of these things, encourage people to do them, and give correction with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
