Psalms.
Chapter 11.
For the chief musician. A psalm of David. I take refuge in Yahweh; how will you say to me, “Flee like a bird to the mountain”? 
For see! The wicked prepare their bows. They make ready their arrows on the strings to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart. 
For if the foundations are ruined, what can the righteous do? 
Yahweh is in his holy temple; his eyes watch, his eyes examine the children of mankind. 
Yahweh examines both the righteous and the wicked, but he hates those who love to do violence. 
He rains burning coals and brimstone upon the wicked; a scorching wind will be their portion from his cup! 
For Yahweh is righteous, and he loves righteousness; the upright will see his face.
