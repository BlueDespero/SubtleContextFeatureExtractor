Psalms.
Chapter 58.
For the chief musician; set to Al Tashheth. A psalm of David. A michtam. Do you rulers speak righteousness? Do you judge uprightly, you people? 
No, you commit wickedness in your heart; you distribute violence throughout the land with your hands. 
The wicked go astray even when they are in the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies. 
Their poison is like a snake's poison; they are like a deaf adder that stops up its ears, 
that pays no attention to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillful they are. 
Break their teeth in their mouths, God; break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh. 
Let them melt away as water that runs off; when they shoot their arrows, let them be as though they had no points. 
Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away, like the untimely-born child of a woman that never sees the sunlight. 
Before your pots can feel the thorn's burning heat, he will take them away with a whirlwind, the green thorns and the burning thorns alike. 
The righteous will rejoice when he sees God's vengeance; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, 
so that men will say, “Truly, there is a reward for the righteous person; truly there is a God who judges the earth.”
