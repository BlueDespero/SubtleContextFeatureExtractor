2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Now, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may rush and be glorified, as it also is with you. 
Pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not all have faith. 
But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one. 
We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you both do and will continue to do the things that we command. 
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ. 
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you avoid every brother who lives a lazy life and does not live according to the traditions you received from us. 
For you yourselves know it is proper for you to imitate us. We did not live among you as those who had no discipline. 
We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, we worked night and day in difficult labor and hardship, so we might not be a burden to any of you. 
We did this not because we have no authority. Instead, we did this in order to be an example to you, so that you may imitate us. 
When we were with you, we commanded you, “The one who is unwilling to work must not eat.” 
For we hear that some walk idly among you. They do not work but are instead meddlers. 
Now such ones we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they should work with quietness and eat their own food. 
But you, brothers, do not become tired of doing what is right. 
If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and have no association with him, so that he may be ashamed. 
Do not consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. 
May the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. May the Lord be with you all. 
This is my greeting, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is how I write. 
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
