Psalms.
Chapter 141.
A psalm of David. Yahweh, I am crying out to you; come quickly to me. Listen to me when I call to you. 
May my prayer be like incense before you; may my lifted hands be like the evening sacrifice. 
Yahweh, place a guard over my mouth; guard the door of my lips. 
Do not let my heart desire any evil thing or participate in sinful activities with men who behave wickedly. May I not eat any of their delicacies. 
Let a righteous man hit me; it will be a kindness to me. Let him correct me; it will be like oil on my head; may my head not refuse to accept it. But my prayer is always against their wicked deeds. 
Their leaders will be thrown down from the top of cliffs; they will hear that my own words are pleasant. 
They will have to say, “As when one plows and breaks up the ground, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.” 
Surely my eyes are on you, Yahweh, Lord; in you I take refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless. 
Protect me from the snares that they have laid for me, from the traps of evildoers. 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets while I escape.
