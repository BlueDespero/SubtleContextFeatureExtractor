Psalms.
Chapter 62.
For the chief musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A psalm of David. I wait in silence for God alone; my salvation comes from him. 
He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my high tower; I will not be greatly moved. 
How long, all of you, will you attack a man, that you may tip him over like a leaning wall or a shaky fence? 
They consult with him only to bring him down from his honorable position; they love to tell lies; they bless him with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse him. Selah 
I wait in silence for God alone; for my hope is set on him. 
He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my high tower; I will not be moved. 
With God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength and my refuge are in God. 
Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah 
Surely men of low standing are vanity, and men of high standing are a lie; they will weigh lightly in the scales; weighed together, they are lighter than nothing. 
Do not trust in oppression or robbery; and do not hope uselessly in riches, for they will bear no fruit; do not fix your heart on them. 
God has spoken once, twice have I heard this: power belongs to God. 
Also to you, Lord, belongs covenant faithfulness, for you pay back every person for what he has done.
