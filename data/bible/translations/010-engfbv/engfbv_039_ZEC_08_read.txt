Zechariah.
Chapter 8.
Then the Lord Almighty sent another message to me. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says. I am jealously protective of the people of Zion; I am extremely passionate about them. 
This is what the Lord says. I have returned to Zion, and I will live in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the “Faithful City,” and the mountain of the Lord Almighty the “Holy Mountain.” 
This is what the Lord Almighty says. Old people will be able to sit again in the streets of Jerusalem, each with their walking sticks they need because of their age. 
The streets will be full of boys and girls playing happily. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says. It may seem too good to be true now, to you who remain of my people in these days. But is it impossible for me to do? asks the Lord Almighty. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says. I will save my people from the countries to the east and to the west. 
I will bring them back and they will live in Jerusalem, and they will be my people and I will be their God, trustworthy and true. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says. Be strong, so that the Temple may be completed. Everyone who is here today is listening to the same words from the prophets who were present on the day when the foundation of the Lord Almighty's Temple was laid. 
Before that time there wasn't enough for people or for animals. No one could live normally because they were not safe from their enemies, and I set everyone against each other. 
But now I won't treat those who remain of my people like I treated them before, declares the Lord Almighty. 
They will sow in peace; the vine will produce grapes; the soil will grow crops and the heavens will water them. I will make sure this happens to all those who remain of this people. 
People of Judah and Israel: just as you were considered a curse among the nations, so I will save you and you will become a blessing. Don't be afraid! Be strong! 
For this is what the Lord Almighty says: I decided to bring disaster on you when your forefathers angered me and I did not change my mind. 
But now I have made up my mind to do good to Jerusalem and the people of Judah. Don't be afraid! 
This what you have to do: Tell each other the truth. In your courts judge honestly and truthfully, which makes for peace. 
Don't think up evil schemes against one another. Stop your love of lies. I hate all this, declares the Lord. 
The Lord Almighty gave me another message. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says: The fasts you observe in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth month will become times of joy and happiness for the people of Judah—they will be festivals of celebration. But love truth and peace. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says: People from many nations and cities will yet come to Jerusalem, 
going from one city to another saying, “Let us be sure to go and seek the Lord and ask for the blessing of the Lord Almighty. I myself am going!” 
Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to ask for the blessing of the Lord Almighty and seek the Lord. 
This is what the Lord Almighty says: At that time ten men from different nations and languages will grab hold of the hem of a Jewish man's robe and plead, “Please take us with you for we have heard that God is with you.”
