Second Timothy.
Chapter 1.
This letter comes from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus chosen by God, sent to tell about the promise of real life that is in Christ Jesus. 
I'm sending it to you Timothy, my dear son. May you have grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
I'm always thinking of you and I'm so thankful to God, whom I serve as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience. I never forget to mention you in my prayers. 
I remember how you cried, and I so want to see you! That would make me really happy. 
I keep in mind your sincere trust in God, the same trust that your grandmother Lois and mother Eunice also had—and I know that same trust continues in you. 
That's why I want to remind you to revitalize God's gracious gift to you which you received when I placed my hands on you. 
God didn't give us a spirit that makes us fearful, but a spirit of power and love and good sense. 
So don't be ashamed to tell others about our Lord, or be ashamed of me. Instead be ready to share in suffering for the good news as God gives you strength. 
He is the one who has saved us and called us to live a holy life—not through what we do, but by God's own plan and through his grace. 
He gave this grace to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, and is now revealed in the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He destroyed death, making life and immortality brilliantly clear through the good news. 
I was appointed speaker, apostle, and teacher of this good news. 
That's also the reason I'm suffering all this, but I'm not ashamed, because I know whom I've trusted. I'm confident that he can look after what I've entrusted to him until the Day he returns. 
You should follow the model of good advice that you learned from me, with an attitude of trust and love in Christ Jesus. 
Guard the truth that was entrusted to you through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 
You already know that everyone from Asia has abandoned me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
May the Lord be kind to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often took care of me and wasn't embarrassed about me being in prison. 
When he was in Rome, he took the trouble to search for me, and he found me. 
May the Lord grant him his blessing in the Day of Judgment. (Timothy, you're very much aware of how much Onesiphorus did for me when he was in Ephesus.)
