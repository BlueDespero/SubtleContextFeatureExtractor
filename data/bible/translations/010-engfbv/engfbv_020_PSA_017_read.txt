Chapter 17.
A prayer of David. Lord, please hear my cry for justice! Please pay attention to my call for help! Listen to the prayer of an honest man! 
Vindicate me before you—for you see what is right. 
You have observed my thoughts, you have visited me at night, you have examined me—and you have found nothing wrong. I promised myself I wouldn't say anything I shouldn't. 
With regard to the actions of others: I have done what you told me and I have avoided what violent people do. 
I have not strayed from your path; my feet have not slipped from it. 
God, I call out to you because I know you will answer; please listen carefully to what I have to say. 
Show me how wonderful your trustworthy love really is, Savior of those who come to you for protection against their enemies! 
Keep me safe as someone you love; hide me underneath your wings. 
Protect me from the attacks of the wicked who want to destroy me, from my enemies who surround me, intent on killing me. 
They have no compassion, and all they have to say is pure arrogance. 
They hunt me down and surround me, looking for the chance to knock me down in the dust. 
They are like lions, longing to tear their prey apart; like fierce lions crouching in ambush. 
Lord, stand up and confront them! Force them to back down! By your sword rescue me from the wicked! 
Lord, by your power, save me from people whose only thought is for this world. May they be filled with what you have in store for them, their children too, with left-overs for their grandchildren! 
As for me, I shall see your face in all its goodness. When I awake, I will be so pleased to see you face to face.
