Chapter 5.
For the music director. A psalm of David, to be accompanied by flutes. Lord, please listen to me. Don't ignore my groans of distress. 
Hear me pleading for help, my King and my God, because I'm praying to you. 
Please listen to what I have to say in the morning, Lord. Every morning I put my requests to you and wait for your reply. 
For you are not a God who has any pleasure in wickedness; evil has no place with you. 
The proud cannot come into your presence; you hate everyone who does evil. 
You destroy those who tell lies. The Lord loathes bloodthirsty and deceptive people. 
But because of the greatness of your trustworthy love, I can come into your house; in awe of you I bow down towards your holy Temple. 
Lead me, Lord, you who always does what is right, save me from my enemies. Make your way clear to me. 
Nothing they say can be trusted; their main desire is to destroy. Their throat is like an open grave; their tongues are full of flattery. 
God, condemn them as guilty! Make them fall because of their evil plans. Throw them out because of all their sins, for they have rebelled against you. 
But may all those who trust in you be happy—may they sing for joy forever. May you spread your protection over them so that everyone who loves your character may celebrate. 
For you, Lord, bless those who live right; you protect them with your shield of love.
