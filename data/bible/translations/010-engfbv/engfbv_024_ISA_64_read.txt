Isaiah.
Chapter 64.
If only you would rip the heavens apart and come down! The mountains would tremble in your presence! 
In the same way that fire burns wood and makes the water boil, make your reputation known to your enemies, so that nations will tremble in your presence! 
In the past you did things we weren't anticipating. You came down and the mountains trembled in your presence! 
Since the beginning, no one has heard about, no one has paid attention to, and no one has seen any God except you, the one who helps those who place their confidence in you. 
You join with those who are glad, and with those who do what's right and remember to follow your ways. But when we went on sinning, you became angry. How can we be saved if we go on like this? 
We've all become unclean, and all the good things we do are like dirty rags. We wither and die like autumn leaves, and our sins, like the wind, blow us away. 
There's no one who calls for you or really wants to hold onto you, because you have hidden your face from us and let us drown in our own sins. 
But you, Lord, are our Father. We're the clay, you're the potter. You made us all with your own hands. 
Please limit your anger, Lord, and don't remember our sins forever. Look at us, and see that we are all your people. 
Your holy cities have been turned into a wilderness; Zion has become a desert; yes, even Jerusalem is an abandoned ruin. 
Our beautiful, holy Temple where our forefathers praised you has been burned down, and all that we treasured has been destroyed. 
In view of all this, are you still going to refuse to help us? Are you going to stay quiet and punish us so severely?
