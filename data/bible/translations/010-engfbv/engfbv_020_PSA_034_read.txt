Chapter 34.
A psalm of David concerning the time he pretended to be mad in front of Abimelech who then sent him away. I will always bless the Lord; my mouth will continually praise him. 
From the bottom of my heart I am proud of the Lord; those who are humble will hear and be happy. 
Glorify God with me; together let's honor his reputation. 
I asked the Lord for help, and he answered me. He set me free from all my fears. 
The faces of those who look to him will shine with joy; they will never be downcast with shame. 
This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard me, and saved me from all my troubles. 
The angel of the Lord stands guard over all those who honor him, keeping them safe. 
Taste, and you will see that the Lord is good! How happy are those who trust in his protection! 
Show your reverence for the Lord, you who are his holy people, for those who respect him have everything they need. 
Lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who trust in the Lord have all that is good. 
Children, listen to me! I will teach you how to respect the Lord. 
Who of you wants to live a long and happy life? 
Then don't let your tongue speak evil, or your lips tell lies. 
Reject what is evil, do what is good. Look for peace, and work to make it a reality. 
The Lord watches over those who do right, and he hears when they cry for help. 
The Lord sets himself against those who do evil. He will wipe out even the memory of them from the earth. 
But when his people call out for help, he hears them and rescues them from all their troubles. 
The Lord is close beside those who are broken-hearted; he saves those whose spirits are crushed. 
Those who do right have many problems, but the Lord solves all of them. 
He keeps them safe—not a single one of their bones will be broken. 
Evil kills the wicked. Those who hate good people will suffer for their wrongdoing. 
The Lord saves the lives of his servants. Those who trust in his protection will not suffer for their wrongdoings.
