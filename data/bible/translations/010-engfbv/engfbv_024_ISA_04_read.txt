Isaiah.
Chapter 4.
At that time seven women will grab hold of one man and tell him, “We'll eat our own food and we can provide our own clothes. Just let us take your name by being married to you. Please take away our disgrace!” 
But at that time, the “branch of the Lord” will be attractive and glorious; the fruit the land produces will be the pride and glory of the survivors who are left in Israel. 
Everyone who remains in Zion will be called holy—all of those who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem— 
once the Lord has washed away the excrement of the daughters of Zion, and cleaned the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire. 
Then the Lord will create over the whole of Mount Zion and over the assembly of those who meet there a cloud of smoke during the day and a blazing flame of fire during night—over everything there will be this glorious canopy. 
It will provide a place to stay in the shade of the daytime heat, and a shelter to hide from storm and rain.
