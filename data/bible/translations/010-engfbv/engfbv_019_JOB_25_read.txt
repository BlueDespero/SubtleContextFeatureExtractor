Job.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said, 
“Dominion and awe belong to God. He brings peace to his heavens. 
Who can count his armies? Is there anywhere his light doesn't shine? 
How can a human being be right before God? Can anyone born of woman be pure? 
If in God's eyes even the moon does not shine brightly, and the stars are not pure, 
how much less a human being—who by comparison is like a maggot or a worm!”
