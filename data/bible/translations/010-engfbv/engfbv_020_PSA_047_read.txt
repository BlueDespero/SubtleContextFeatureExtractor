Chapter 47.
For the music director. A psalm of the sons of Korah. Everyone, clap your hands! Shout with joy to the Lord! 
For the Lord Most High is awe-inspiring; he is the great King of all the earth. 
He subdues other peoples under us; he puts nations under our feet. 
He chose the land for us to own; the proud possession of Jacob's descendants whom he loves. Selah. 
God ascends his throne with a great shout, the Lord is accompanied by the sound of the trumpet. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises! 
For God is King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm! 
God rules over the nations; he sits on his holy throne. 
The rulers of the nations gather together with the people of the God of Abraham, for the defenders of the earth belong to God. He is highly honored everywhere.
