Chapter 97.
The Lord reigns! Let the earth be glad, and distant lands be full of joy! 
He is surrounded by clouds and thick darkness; his throne is founded on justice and right. 
Flames proceed him, burning up his enemies on every side. 
His flashes of lightning light up the world; the earth watches and trembles. 
The mountains melt like wax in the presence of the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth. 
The heavens proclaim his goodness; everyone sees his glory. 
All those who worship idols are humiliated, those who are proud of their idols—for all “gods” bow down before him. 
Jerusalem hears this and celebrates; all the towns of Judah are happy because of your judgments, Lord. 
For you, Lord, are the highest of all, ruling over the whole earth; your position is far above any other god. 
You who love the Lord, hate evil! He protects the lives of those who are faithful to him, and saves them from the power of wicked people. 
Light shines on those who do good, giving joy to those who live right. 
Be happy in the Lord, you who do right, and thank him for his holy nature!
