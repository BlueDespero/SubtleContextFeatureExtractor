Chapter 132.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. Lord, remember David, and all that he went through. 
He made a promise to the Lord, a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob: 
“I will not go home, I will not go to bed, 
I will not go to sleep, I will not take a nap, 
until I find a place where the Lord can live, a home for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 
In Ephrathah we received information about the Ark of Agreement, and we found it in fields near Jaar. 
Let's go to the place where the Lord lives and bow down at his feet in worship. 
Come, Lord, and enter your home, together with your Ark of your power. 
May your priests wear goodness like clothing; may your faithful people shout for joy. 
For the sake of your servant David, don't reject the king you have chosen. 
The Lord made a solemn promise to David, one he will never cancel—“I will put one of your descendants on your throne. 
If your sons keep to my agreement and my laws that I will teach them, then their sons will always occupy your throne.” 
For the Lord has chosen Zion, wanting to make his home there, saying: 
“This will always be my home; this is where I want to live. 
I will provide the people of the city with all they need; I will feed the poor. 
I will clothe its priests with salvation; and its faithful people will shout for joy. 
I will make the line of David even more powerful. I have prepared a lamp for my chosen king. 
I will humiliate his enemies, but the crown he wears will shine brightly.”
