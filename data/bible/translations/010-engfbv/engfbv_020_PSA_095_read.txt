Chapter 95.
Come, let's sing for joy to the Lord! Let's shout in triumph to the rock of our salvation! 
Let's go before him with thanksgiving! Let's sing loudly to him in celebration! 
For the Lord is a great God, a great king above all gods. 
He rules over the depths of the earth and the heights of the mountains. 
The sea is his, because he made it; the dry land, because he formed it. 
Come, let's enter in and worship, let's kneel before the Lord our Creator. 
For he is our God, and we are the people he looks after like a shepherd, the flock he cares for. If you hear his voice calling you today, 
don't have a hard-hearted attitude, “as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the desert, 
when your forefathers provoked me, testing my patience, even though they had seen everything I'd done. 
For forty years I was disgusted with that generation, and I said, ‘They are people who are unfaithful to me in their minds, and they refuse to accept my ways.’ 
So in my frustration I vowed, ‘They will certainly not enter my rest.’”
