Chapter 26.
A psalm of David. Confirm that I'm innocent, Lord, for I have acted with integrity, and I have trusted in the Lord without fail. 
Examine me, Lord, test me; investigate my thoughts and intentions. 
For I always remember your trustworthy love, and I follow your truth. 
I don't join in with liars and I don't associate with hypocrites. 
I refuse to get together with those who do evil, and I won't involve myself with the wicked. 
I wash my hands to show my innocence. I come to worship at your altar, Lord, 
singing my thanks, telling of all the wonderful things you have done. 
Lord, I love your house, the place where you live in your glory. 
Please don't sweep me away along with sinners. Don't include me with those who commit murder, 
whose hands carry out their evil schemes and grab hold of bribes. 
For I don't do that—I act with integrity. Save me and be gracious to me! 
I stand for what's right, and I will praise the Lord when we meet together to worship him.
