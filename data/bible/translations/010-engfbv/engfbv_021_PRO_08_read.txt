Proverbs.
Chapter 8.
Isn't wisdom calling? Isn't understanding raising her voice? 
On the top of the hill by the road, she stands up at the crossroads. 
Beside the gates of the town, right there at the entrance, she cries out: 
“I'm calling out to you, everyone! My call is to everyone in the whole world! 
If you're immature, learn how to grow up. If you're stupid, learn what makes good sense. 
Listen to me because I have valuable things to explain to you. 
I say what's right, because I tell the truth and I hate wickedness in all its forms. 
All the words I say are true; none are false or misleading. 
My words are straightforward to anyone with understanding; they are correct to those who have knowledge. 
Choose my instruction over silver; choose knowledge over pure gold. 
For wisdom is more valuable than rubies; everything you could ever want just doesn't compare! 
I, wisdom, am at home with good decisions. I know how to find knowledge and discernment. 
Honoring the Lord means hating evil. So I hate pride and arrogance, wicked behavior and telling lies. 
I have advice and good judgment; I know what makes sense, and I have power. 
It's because of me that kings reign, and rulers issue fair decrees. 
It's because of me that leaders and nobles govern—all who rule justly. 
I love those who love me, and those who really look for me will find me. 
With me go riches and honor, lasting wealth and prosperity. 
The fruit I produce is better than gold, even pure gold, and my harvest is better than even the best silver. 
I live in a way that's right; I follow the paths of justice. 
I grant wealth to those who love me; I fill their treasure storehouses. 
The Lord created me first of all; I was made before anything else. 
I was formed a long time ago, at the first, before the world began. 
I was born when there were no ocean depths, when there were no springs pouring out water. 
I was born before the mountains or the hills had been formed, 
when he hadn't made the earth and its fields or any of the earth's dust. 
I was there when he placed the heavens in position, when he drew the horizon over the ocean, 
when he made the clouds in the sky above, when he created the springs of the oceans, 
when he set limits on the sea so that the waters would not go farther than he ordered, and when he laid out the foundations of the earth. 
Then I was beside him as a master craftsman. I made him happy every day, and I was always full of joy in his presence. 
I was so happy in the world he created, celebrating together with human beings. 
And now, my sons, listen to me, for happy are those who follow my ways. 
Listen to my instruction and be wise—do not reject it. 
Happy are those who listen to me, watching for me every day at my doors, waiting at my entrance way. 
For those who find me, find life, and are accepted by the Lord. 
But those who don't find me hurt themselves; everyone who hates me loves death.”
