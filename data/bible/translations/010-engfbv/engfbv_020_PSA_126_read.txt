Chapter 126.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. When the Lord brought his people back from captivity to Zion, it was as if we were dreaming! 
We laughed so much, we sang for joy. The other nations said, “The Lord has done wonderful things for these people.” 
The Lord certainly has done wonderful things for us. How happy we were! 
Please return and help us again, Lord. Renew us like streams of water that renew the Negev desert. 
Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy! 
Those who weep as they go out to sow their seed will be singing in celebration when they carry the harvest home.
