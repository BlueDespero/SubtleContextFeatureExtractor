Chapter 16.
A psalm (miktam) of David. Take care of me, Lord, for I come to you for protection. 
I tell the Lord, “Apart from you Lord, I don't have anything that's good.” 
As for the holy people in the land, they are the ones who are truly great. I appreciate them. 
Those who run after other gods will face a lot of trouble. I will not participate in their offerings of blood, I will not even speak the names of their gods. 
Lord, you alone are all I have; you give me what I need; you safeguard my future. 
The land divisions have worked out in my favor—my property is wonderful! 
I will bless the Lord who gives me good advice; even at night my conscience tells me what is right. 
I have always kept the Lord in front of me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me. 
That's why I'm so happy! That's why I am full of joy! That's why my body lives in hope! 
For you will not abandon me in the grave, nor will you allow your Holy One to experience decay. 
You have shown me the path of life, filling me with joy with your presence and the delight of living with you forever.
