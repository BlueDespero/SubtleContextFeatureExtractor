Revelation.
Chapter 18.
After this I saw another angel descending from heaven. He had great power and the earth was lit up by his glory. 
He shouted out in a powerful voice, “Babylon the great has collapsed into ruins! She has become a place where demons live, the refuge of every unclean spirit, and the roost of every unclean and detestable bird. 
For all the nations have drunk the wine of her mad sexual immorality. The kings of the earth have committed adultery with her, and the traders of the earth have grown rich from her excessive sensuality.” 
Then I heard another voice from heaven calling out, “My people, come out of her, so that you don't participate in her sinful ways, and so that you don't experience her plagues. 
Her sins have piled up all the way to heaven, and God is very much aware of her wickedness. 
Give back to her what she gave; repay her double for what she did. In her own cup mix double the trouble she mixed for others. 
As much as she boasted about herself and indulged her lusts, give her back just as much anguish and sorrow. She told herself, ‘I reign as queen. I am no widow; I will never be in mourning.’ 
Because of this her plagues will come upon her in just one day: death, mourning, and famine. She will be completely destroyed by fire, for the Lord God who condemns her has great power. 
The kings of the earth who had committed adultery with her and indulged their lusts with her will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke of the fire that destroys her. 
Standing off at a distance because they are afraid they will suffer the same agony as her, they say, ‘Disaster, disaster has struck Babylon, the great city! In just one hour your sentence of doom was executed!’ 
The traders of the earth cry and grieve over her, because nobody is buying their goods any more— 
products made of gold, silver, gems and pearls; fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet material; all kinds of objects made of scented wood, or from ivory, or expensive woods, or bronze, iron, or marble; 
shipments of cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and wagons, and slaves and prisoners. 
You've lost the sweet pleasures you loved so much; all your luxurious, glittering possessions are gone—you'll never get any of them back. 
The traders who sold these things and became rich from trading with her will stand at a distance because they are afraid they will suffer the same agony as her. They will cry and grieve, saying, 
‘Disaster, disaster has hit the great city! She was clothed in fine linen and purple robes, and wore jewelry made of gold and gems and pearls. 
In just one hour all this wealth was destroyed!’ Every sea captain and everyone who travels by sea and every sailor and everyone who earns their living from the sea stood at a distance. 
As they watched the smoke of the fire that destroys her, they shouted out, ‘What city could ever compare to this great city?’ 
They threw dust on their heads, shouting and crying and grieving, ‘Disaster, disaster has struck the great city that made every ship-owner rich because of her extravagance! In just one hour she was destroyed!’ 
Celebrate what's happened to her, heaven and believers and apostles and prophets, for God has condemned her as she condemned you.” 
A powerful angel picked up a rock the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “With this kind of violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, and will never exist again.” 
“Never again will anyone hear music in you: the sound of harps, singers, flutes, and trumpets. Never again will craftsmen of any trade work in you. Never again will the sound of a mill be heard in you. 
Never again will the light of a lamp shine in you. Never again will the voices of bridegroom and bride be heard in you. Your traders led the world. Through your witchcraft all the nations were deceived. 
In her the blood of prophets and believers was found, and of all those who have been killed on the earth.”
