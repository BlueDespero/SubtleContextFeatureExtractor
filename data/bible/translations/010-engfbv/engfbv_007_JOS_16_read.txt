Joshua.
Chapter 16.
The boundary for the allocation of the descendants of Joseph went from the Jordan near Jericho, then east of the springs of Jericho and through the wilderness from Jericho up into the hill country of Bethel. 
From Bethel (or Luz) it continued to the border of Ataroth the Arkite. 
Then it descended west to the border of the Japhletites and the border of Lower Beth-horon, on up to Gezer, and then out to the sea. 
This was the allocation received by the descendants of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh. 
This was the territory allocated to the tribe of Ephraim, by families. The boundary of their allocation ran from Ataroth-addar in the east to Upper Beth-horon 
and then on to the sea. From Michmethath in the north the boundary turned east passing Taanath-shiloh to the east of Janoah. 
From Janoah it went down to Ataroth and Naarah, then touched Jericho and ended at the Jordan. 
From Tappuah the boundary ran west to the Brook of Kanah and then out to the sea. This was the land allotted to the tribe of Ephraim, by families. 
Also some towns with their associated villages that lay in the land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh were assigned to the tribe of Ephraim. 
However, they did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites live among the tribe of Ephraim to this very day, but as forced laborers.
