Chapter 28.
A psalm of David. Lord, my rock, I'm calling out to you. Please listen to me! For if you don't respond, I'll be like those who go down into the grave. 
Listen as I appeal for mercy, as I call for help, as I hold up my hands in prayer towards your holy Temple. 
Don't drag me off with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak nicely to their neighbors while in their minds they're plotting evil. 
Give them what they deserve for their evil actions. Pay them back for what they've done. Give them the reward they've earned! 
For they don't pay any attention to what the Lord does, or to what he created. So he will destroy them—they will never be restored. 
Praise the Lord! For he has heard my appeal for mercy! 
The Lord is my strength and my shield. I trust in him and he helps me. I'm so happy, and I sing my thanks to him. 
The Lord gives strength to his people; he is a safe refuge for the one he has anointed. 
Save your people! Bless your “special possession”! Be their shepherd and carry them in your arms forever!
