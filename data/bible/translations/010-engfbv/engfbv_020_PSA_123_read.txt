Chapter 123.
A song for pilgrims going up to Jerusalem. I look up to you, the one who rules from heaven. 
Just as servants look to their master, or a maid looks to her mistress, so we keep our eyes on you, Lord our God, waiting for you to be merciful to us. 
Please have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy. We've had enough of people's contempt. 
We've had more than enough of the scorn of the proud, and the contempt of the arrogant.
