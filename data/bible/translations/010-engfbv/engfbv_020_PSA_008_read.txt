Chapter 8.
For the music director. On the gittith. A psalm of David. Lord, our Lord, your magnificent reputation fills the earth! Your majesty is greater than the heavens above, 
and is sung by the voices of children and infants. Your strength counters your opponents, silencing the enemy and the avenger. 
When I contemplate the heavens that your hands made, the moon and stars that you placed there, 
What are human beings that you should concern yourself with them? What are people that you should care for them? 
You created them a little lower than God, crowning them with glory and majesty. 
You put them in charge of all that you made, giving them authority over everything: 
the sheep, the cattle, and the wild animals, 
the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea—everything that swims in the ocean. 
Lord, our Lord, your magnificent reputation fills the earth!
