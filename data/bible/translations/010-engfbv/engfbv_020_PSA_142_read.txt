Chapter 142.
A maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer. I call out to the Lord for help; pleading with the Lord for mercy. 
I pour out my complaints before him; I tell him what's troubling me. 
When I'm totally discouraged, you know the direction I should take. But whichever way I go, people set traps for me. 
I look to my right for someone to support me—but no one pays me any attention. There's no safe place for me—no one cares about me at all. 
I cry out to you, Lord, for help, saying, “You are the one who keeps me safe; you are all I need in life. 
Please listen to my sad cry, for I'm feeling very low. Please save me from those who are after me, for they're too strong for me. 
Release me from my prison so I can praise you for the person you are! Those who live right will gather round me because you have treated me so well.”
