Psalms.
Chapter 1.
Happy are those who don't follow the advice of the wicked. They refuse to adopt the ways of sinful people, and they don't make fun of others. 
Instead they love to do what the law of the Lord says, and they think about it day and night. 
They're like trees growing by flowing rivers, producing fruit every season. Their leaves never wither, and they are successful in all they do. 
But it's not like that for the wicked! They are like chaff, blown away by the wind. 
For this reason the wicked will not survive the judgment—sinners have no place among those who live right. 
For the Lord watches over those who follow the right way, but the way of the wicked leads to death.
