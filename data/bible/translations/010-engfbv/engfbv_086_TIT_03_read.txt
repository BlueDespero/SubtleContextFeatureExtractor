Titus.
Chapter 3.
Remind them to follow what rulers tell them to do, and to obey authorities. They should always be ready to do what is good. 
They should not speak badly about anyone, and they should not be argumentative. Tell them to show gentleness and kindness to everyone. 
For there was a time when we too were foolish and disobedient. We were deceived and slaves to various desires and pleasures. We lived wicked lives full of jealousy, hateful people hating one another. 
But when the goodness and love of God our Savior was revealed, he saved us, 
not because of anything good that we've done, but because of his mercy. He did this through the cleansing of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit, 
which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior. 
Now that we are set right by his grace we have become heirs having the hope of eternal life. 
You can trust what I'm saying, and I want you to emphasize these instructions so that those who trust in God will think seriously about them and continue to do good. They are excellent and helpful for everyone. 
Avoid pointless discussions, and obsessions about ancestry. Don't get into arguments, and avoid fights over the Jewish laws—they're useless and don't help at all. 
Warn someone who is divisive once, and then again—after that don't pay them any attention, 
realizing that they're perverse and sinful and have condemned themselves. 
As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, try and come to me at Nicopolis because I'm planning to spend the winter there. 
Do all you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that they have everything they need. 
May our people learn the habit of doing good in providing for the daily needs of others. They need to be productive! 
Everyone here with me sends their greetings. Give our best wishes to those who love us, those who trust in God. May grace be with you all.
