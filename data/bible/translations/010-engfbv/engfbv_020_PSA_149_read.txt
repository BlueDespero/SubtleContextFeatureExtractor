Chapter 149.
Praise the Lord! Sing a new song to the Lord! Praise him wherever his faithful followers gather! 
Let Israel celebrate their Creator; let the people of Zion be happy in their King. 
Praise his nature with dancing; sing praises to him, accompanied by tambourine and harp. 
For the Lord enjoys his people; he honors the oppressed with salvation. 
Let the faithful celebrate how he honors them; let them sing happily even from their beds. 
May their praises of God always be on their lips, a double-edged sword in their hands, 
ready to take revenge on the nations, to punish the foreign peoples, 
to imprison their kings in shackles and their leaders in iron chains, 
to impose the judgment decreed against them. This is an honor for all his faithful followers. Praise the Lord!
