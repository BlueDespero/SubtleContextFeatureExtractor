Chapter 14.
For the music director. A psalm of David. Only fools tell themselves, “God doesn't exist.” They are completely immoral; they commit terrible sins; not a single one of them does anything good. 
The Lord watches from heaven to see whether anyone understands—if there's anyone who wants to come to God. 
They have all gone their own way, they are totally depraved; none of them does anything good, not even one. 
Won't these people who do evil ever learn? They consume my people as if they were eating bread, and refuse to pray to the Lord. 
Look, they will become terrified, because God is with those who live right. 
The wicked dismiss the plans of the poor people, but the Lord looks after them. 
If only the Lord's salvation would come from Zion! When the Lord restores his people, the people of Jacob will celebrate, and the people of Israel will be glad.
