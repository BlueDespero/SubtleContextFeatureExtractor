Chapter 30.
A psalm of David. A psalm for the dedication of the Temple. I want to tell everyone how good you are, Lord, for you saved me, and you didn't let my enemies triumph over me. 
Lord, my God, I called out to you for help, and you have healed me. 
Lord, you rescued me from the grave, you brought me back to life, saving me from going down into the pit of death. 
You who trust the Lord, sing praises to him, and be thankful for his holy character! 
For his anger only lasts a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime. You may spend the night in tears, but happiness comes with the morning. 
When things were going well, I said, “Nothing will ever shake me!” 
Lord, when you showed me your favor I stood as strong as a mountain; when you turned away from me I was terrified. 
I called out to you for help, Lord. I asked the Lord for grace, saying, 
What would you gain if I die, if I go down into the pit of death? Would my dust praise you? Would it tell of your trustworthiness? 
Please listen to me, Lord, and be gracious to me! Lord, you are the one who helps me. 
You have turned my weeping into dancing. You have taken off my clothes of sackcloth and dressed me in happiness, 
so I can sing praises to you and not keep quiet. Lord my God, I will thank you forever!
