Chapter 76.
For the music director. To be accompanied by stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song. God is famous in Judah; his reputation is great throughout Israel. 
He lives in Jerusalem; his home is in Zion. 
There he broke the flaming arrows, the shields, the swords, and the weapons of war. Selah. 
You shine with light; you are more majestic than the everlasting mountains. 
Our most courageous enemies have been plundered. They sleep the sleep of death. Even the strongest of them could not raise a hand against us. 
At your command, God of Jacob, both horse and rider fell down dead. 
You are terrifying—who can stand before you when you are angry? 
From heaven you announced judgment. Everyone on earth was afraid and stood still, 
when you stood up to judge, to save the oppressed people of the earth. Selah. 
Even human anger against you makes you look glorious, for you wear it alike a crown. 
Make your promises to God and be sure to keep them. Everyone bring gifts to the awe-inspiring one. 
For he humbles proud leaders; he terrifies the kings of the earth.
