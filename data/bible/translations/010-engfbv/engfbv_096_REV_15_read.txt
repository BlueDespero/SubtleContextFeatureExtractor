Revelation.
Chapter 15.
Then I saw another amazing, important sign in heaven. Seven angels held the seven last plagues which complete God's judgment. 
I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Standing beside the sea of glass were those who had defeated the beast and his image and the number of his name. They had harps given to them by God 
and they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: “What you have done is tremendous and marvelous, Lord God, the All-powerful One. Your ways are right and true, King of the nations. 
Who would not be in awe of you, Lord? Who would not glorify your name? For only you are holy. All nations will come and worship you because you have demonstrated by your actions that you do what is right!” 
After this I looked and the Temple of the “Tent of Witness” was opened. 
Out of the Temple came the seven angels who held the seven plagues, wearing clean, white linen clothes and golden sashes on their chests. 
One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the judgment of God, who lives for ever and ever. 
The Temple was filled with smoke that came from the glory of God and from his power. Nobody was able to enter the Temple until the seven plagues that came from the seven angels were over.
