Chapter 86.
A prayer of David. Please listen to me, Lord! Please answer me, for I am weak and really need your help! 
Don't let me die, for I am faithful to you. Save me, for I am your servant and I trust in you. You are my God. 
Be kind to me, Lord, for I call out to you all day long. 
Make me happy, Lord, for I've dedicated my life to you. 
For you, Lord, are good; you are forgiving and full of trustworthy love for all who come to you. 
Lord, please listen to my prayer. Hear my call for help. 
When I'm in trouble I cry out to you because I know you will answer me. 
There's no one like you among the “gods,” Lord. No one can do the things you do. 
You created all the nations, and they will come and bow down before you, Lord. They will declare how wonderful you are. 
For you are great, and do wonderful things! Only you are God. 
Lord, please teach me your way, so I can depend on your trustworthiness. Make me single-minded, so I can consistently honor the kind of person you are. 
Lord my God, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will praise your character forever. 
For your trustworthy love for me is so great; you have saved me from death. 
God, arrogant people are attacking me, vicious people are trying to kill me. To them you count for nothing. 
But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to become angry, full of trustworthy love and faithfulness. 
Turn to me, have mercy on me. Give me your strength, your servant; save the son of your servant-girl. 
Show me a sign that you approve of me! Those who hate me will see it, and they will be ashamed because you, Lord, have helped me.
