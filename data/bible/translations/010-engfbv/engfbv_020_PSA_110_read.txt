Chapter 110.
A psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for you.” 
The Lord will expand your royal power from Zion; you will rule over your enemies. 
Your people willingly follow you on the day when your power is revealed on the holy mountains, renewed in strength every morning like dew at dawn. 
The Lord has made a vow he will not break: “You are a priest forever, following the order of Melchizedek.” 
The Lord stands right beside you to support you; he will strike down kings in his anger. 
He will execute judgment on the nations, filling their lands with corpses. He will strike down those who rule all over the earth. 
He will drink from streams beside the path. Therefore he will be victorious.
