Jeremiah.
Chapter 24.
The Lord showed me in vision two baskets of figs placed in front of the Lord's Temple. This happened after Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken to Babylon Jehoiachin, son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, as well as the leaders of Judah, and the craftsmen and metal-workers from Jerusalem. 
One basket was full of very good figs, like those that ripen early, but the other basket only had very bad figs, so bad they couldn't be eaten. 
“Jeremiah,” the Lord asked, “what can you see?” “I see figs!” I replied. “The good figs look very good, but the bad figs look very bad, so bad they can't be eaten.” 
Then a message from the Lord came to me, saying, 
This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: The good figs represent to me the exiles from Judah, those I have sent away from here to the country of Babylonia. 
I will watch over them and I will bring them back to this country. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. 
I will give them the desire to know me, to know that I am the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will come back completely committed to me. 
But the bad figs, so bad they cannot be eaten, says the Lord, represent the way I will deal with Zedekiah, king of Judah, his officials, and those who are left of Jerusalem, as well as those remaining in this country and those living in Egypt. 
I'm going to make an example of them that will horrify and offend everyone on earth. They will be disgraced, mocked, ridiculed, and cursed everywhere I've exiled them. 
I'm going to attack them with war and famine and plague, until they're completely wiped out from the country that I gave to them and their forefathers.
