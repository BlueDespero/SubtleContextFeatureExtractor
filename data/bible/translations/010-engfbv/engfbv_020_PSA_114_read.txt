Chapter 114.
At the time of the exodus of Israel from Egypt, when the descendants of Jacob left that foreign country, 
the land of Judah became the Lord's sanctuary, Israel his kingdom. 
The Red Sea saw them and ran away; the Jordan River retreated. 
Mountains jumped in fright like rams, hills startled like lambs. 
Red Sea—why did you run away? Jordan River—why did you retreat? 
Mountains—why did you jump in fright? Hills—why did you startle like lambs? 
Earth, tremble in the presence of the Lord, tremble in the presence of the God of Jacob! 
He is the one who turned the rock into a pool of water; making water flow from the hard rock.
