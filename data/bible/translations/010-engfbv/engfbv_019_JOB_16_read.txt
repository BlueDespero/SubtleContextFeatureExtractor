Job.
Chapter 16.
Job replied, 
“I've heard all this before. You are comforters who just cause trouble! 
Will your windy speeches never cease? What's bothering you that you have to answer me? 
I could talk like you do if you were in my place, stringing words together to criticize you, ridiculing you with a toss of my head. 
I could build you up by my mouth speaking words; the movement of my lips would ease your pain. 
For me, if I speak it doesn't ease my pain, and if I don't speak the pain is still there. 
God, you have worn me out. You have destroyed my whole family. 
You have made me shrivel up, which is a witness against me; my thin body testifies against me. 
He has torn me apart in his anger; in his hostility he has gnashed his teeth at me; my enemy pierces me with his fierce look. 
People stare at me with their mouths wide open, they slap me on my cheeks to mock me, they crowd around me to attack me. 
God has handed me over to evil people; he has thrown me into their hands. 
I was living in peace and he smashed me to pieces. He grabbed me by the neck and dashed me to pieces. He set me up as his target. 
His archers surround me. His arrows pierce my kidneys without mercy. He pours out my gall on the ground. 
Like a wall he breaks me down, breach upon breach, rushing at me like a warrior. 
I have sown sackcloth to cover my skin; my strength lies broken in the dust. 
My face is red from crying and dark shadows surround my eyes, 
although I have done nothing wrong and my prayer is pure. 
Earth, do not cover up my blood. May my cry find no place to hide. 
Look, right now my witness is in heaven; the one who speaks for me is on high. 
My friends scorn me, but my eyes pour out tears to God. 
I want my witness to speak for me with God as someone does for their friend. 
For in a few short years I shall go down that road from which I shall not return.
