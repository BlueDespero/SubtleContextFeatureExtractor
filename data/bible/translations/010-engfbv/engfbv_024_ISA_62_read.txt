Isaiah.
Chapter 62.
I can't remain silent because of my love for Zion, I can't keep quiet because of my love for Jerusalem, until her integrity shines like a beam of light, until her salvation blazes like a burning torch. 
The nations will see the way you live right, and all the kings will see how you are blessed, and you will be called by a new name that the Lord gives you. 
You will be a crown of beauty in the Lord's hand; a royal head-dress in the hand of your God. 
You won't be called Abandoned anymore; your land won't be called Desolate. Instead you will be called She Makes Me Happy, and your land will be called Married, because you make the Lord happy, and your land will be married. 
For just like a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and like a groom is happy with his bride, so your God will be happy with you. 
I have placed watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they won't ever be silent, day or night. You who pray to the Lord, don't ever stop and take a rest. 
Don't give the Lord a rest either, until he finishes his work, until he makes Jerusalem the most praiseworthy place on earth. 
The Lord has made a solemn promise, swearing by his power and might: I won't ever again let your enemies have your grain to eat, or let foreigners drink the new wine you worked hard for. 
Instead, those who harvest the grain will eat it and praise the Lord, and those who harvest the grapes for the wine will drink it in the courts of my Temple. 
Exit! Exit through the gates! Clear the way for the people! Build the highway! Get rid of any rocks on the road! Lift up a flag so the nations can see! 
See! The Lord has announced to everyone on earth, Tell the Daughter of Zion: Look! Your Savior is coming. He's bringing his reward with him, coming to give his gift! 
They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you will be called the Sought-After Place, A City No Longer Abandoned.
