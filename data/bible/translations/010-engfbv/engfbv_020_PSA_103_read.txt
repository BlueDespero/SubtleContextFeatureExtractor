Chapter 103.
A psalm of David. Let every part of me praise the Lord; let my whole being praise his holy character. 
Let every part of me praise the Lord; don't let me forget the wonderful things he's done for me. 
He forgives my sins, and he heals all my diseases. 
He saves me from death; he honors me with trustworthy love and mercy. 
He fills my life with all that's good; he makes me young again, strong as an eagle. 
The Lord does what is right, and vindicates those who are exploited. 
He explained his ways to Moses: he told the people of Israel what he was going to do. 
The Lord is kind and gracious, not quick-tempered, and full of trustworthy love. 
He doesn't keep on accusing us; he doesn't stay angry with us forever. 
He does not punish us for our sins as he ought to; he does not pay us back for our wrongdoing as we deserve. 
For as high as the heavens are above the earth is the extent of his trustworthy love to those who honor him. 
As far as the east is from the west is how far the Lord has taken our sins away from us. 
Like a loving father, the Lord is kind and compassionate to those who follow him. 
For he knows how we are made; he remembers we are only dust. 
Human lifetimes are like grass: we blossom like flowers in a field, 
but then the wind blows and we are gone, disappearing without a trace. 
But the Lord's trustworthy love lasts for all eternity to those who accept him; his goodness to all generations, 
to those who keep his agreement and who remember to follow his commandments. 
The Lord has set up his throne in the heavens, and he rules over all. 
Praise the Lord, you angels, you powerful ones who do what he says, listening to what he tells you! 
Praise the Lord, you heavenly armies who serve him and carry out his will! 
Praise the Lord, everything in his creation, everyone under his rule, and let every part of me praise the Lord!
