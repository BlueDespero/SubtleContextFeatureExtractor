Chapter 27.
A psalm of David. The Lord is my light and my salvation! How could anyone scare me? The Lord is my life's fortress! How could anyone terrify me? 
When evil people come at me to tear me apart, it's my enemies, those who are against me, they're the ones who trip and fall. 
Even if an army surrounds me, I won't be frightened. Even if I am attacked, I will still trust in God. 
I only ask the Lord for one thing: I just want to live in the house of the Lord throughout my life, contemplating the Lord's goodness and thinking about his Temple. 
When troubles come he will protect me and keep me safe, hiding me in his house, as secure as if he'd placed me on a high rock. 
He will hold my head high over my enemies who are all around me. I shall offer sacrifices in his house with shouts of joy, and I will sing praises to the Lord. 
Listen to me, Lord, when I call for help. Be gracious and answer me. 
You told me, “Come to me.” I am coming to you, Lord. 
Don't refuse to talk to me. Don't be angry with your servant and turn away. You are the one who helps me, so please don't reject me and abandon me, God of my salvation. 
Even if my father and my mother abandon me, the Lord will take care of me. 
Lord, teach me your way and lead me along the right path, because my enemies are against me— 
don't hand me over to them and their evil intentions, for they are making false accusations against me and threatening me with violence. 
However, I'm absolutely sure that I will see the Lord's goodness even in this life. 
Trust in the Lord! Be confident—he will give you courage! Trust in the Lord!
