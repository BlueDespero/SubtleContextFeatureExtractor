Acts.
Chapter 14.
In Iconium the same thing happened. Paul and Barnabas went to the Jewish synagogue and spoke so convincingly that many of both the Jewish and Greek-speaking worshipers trusted in Jesus. 
But the Jews that refused to believe in Jesus stirred up the feelings of the foreigners, and poisoned them against the believers. 
Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time, speaking to them boldly in the Lord, who confirmed their message of grace through the miraculous signs that they were enabled to perform. 
The inhabitants of the town were divided, with some supporting the Jews and some the apostles. 
But then the foreigners and the Jews, together with their leaders, decided to attack and stone Paul and Barnabas. 
However, they found out about it and fled to the region of Lycaonia, to the towns of Lystra and Derbe, 
where they continued to share the good news. 
In the town of Lystra there was a disabled man who was lame in both feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never been able to walk. 
He sat there listening to Paul speaking. When Paul looked directly at him, and realized that the man was trusting in God to heal him, 
Paul said in a loud voice, “Stand up on your feet!” The man jumped to his feet and started walking. 
When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted out in the language of Lycaonia, “The gods have come down to us looking like men!” 
They identified Barnabas as the Greek god Zeus, and Paul as the god Hermes because he was one who did most of the talking. 
The priest of the temple of Zeus that lay just outside the town, brought oxen and wreaths to the town gates. He planned to carry out a sacrifice in front of the crowds. 
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul learned what was happening, they tore their clothes, and rushed into the crowds, shouting out, 
“People, what are you doing? We are human beings with the same kind of nature as you. We came to bring you good news, so you could turn from these pointless things to a God who is truly alive. He is the one who made heaven, earth, and sea, and everything in them. 
In past times he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways. 
Even so he still provided evidence of himself by doing good, sending you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons, providing all the food you need, and filling you with happiness.” 
With these words they barely managed to stop the crowds from offering sacrifices to them. 
But then some Jews from Antioch and Iconium arrived and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul, and dragged him outside the town, thinking he was dead. 
But when the believers gathered around him, he got up, and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe. 
After sharing the good news with the people in that town, and after many had become believers, they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. 
They encouraged the believers to remain firm and to continue to trust in Jesus. “We have to go through many trials to enter God's kingdom,” they said. 
After they had appointed elders for every church, and had prayed and fasted with them, Paul and Barnabas left them in the Lord's care, the one that they trusted in. 
They passed through Pisidia, and arrived in Pamphylia. 
They spoke God's word in Perga, and then went on to Attalia. 
From there they sailed back to Antioch where they had started out, having been dedicated there in God's grace to the work they had now accomplished. 
When they arrived, they called the church together. They reported everything God had done through them, and how he had opened a door for the foreigners to trust in him. 
They stayed there with the believers for a long time.
