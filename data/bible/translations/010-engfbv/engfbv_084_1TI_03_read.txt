1 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
This is a trustworthy statement: “If someone aspires to be an elder, this is a good work to want to do.” 
An elder must be above reproach, married to one wife, self-controlled, well-balanced, sensible, hospitable, and able to teach. 
He should be someone who doesn't get drunk or become violent, but is gentle, and is not argumentative or greedy for money. 
He must handle his own family well. His children must respect what he tells them to do. 
(For if a man doesn't know how to manage his own family, how can he manage God's church?) 
He should not be a new believer, in case he gets so full of himself he falls under the same condemnation as the devil. 
People outside the church should also speak well of him so that he won't disgrace himself and fall into the devil's trap. 
Similarly deacons should be respected, and not hypocritical. They should not be addicted to drink, and should not be trying to dishonestly enrich themselves. 
They must stick to the revealed truth about God, trusting in him with a pure conscience. 
They should be tried out first, and if they can't be faulted then let them serve as deacons. 
Their wives should be respected too. They should not slander people with gossip, and they should be self-controlled and trustworthy in all they do. 
Deacons should be married to one wife, managing their children and their homes well. 
Those who serve well as deacons gain a good reputation and much confidence in their trust in Christ Jesus. 
Even though I hope to see you soon, I'm writing about all this to you so that 
if I'm delayed you'll know how people should behave themselves in God's house. This is the church of the living God, the support pillar and foundation of the truth. 
There's no question about it: the revealed truth about God is amazing! He was made known to us in human form, he was vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, declared to the nations, trusted in by the world, and taken up in glory!
