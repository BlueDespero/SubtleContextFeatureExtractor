PSALMS.
Chapter 38.
A psalm of David, for a memorial. Lord, please don't condemn me because you're angry with me; don't punish me because you're furious with me! 
Your arrows have pierced me deeply, your hand has come down hard on me. 
Because you're so upset with me, not a single part of my body is healthy; I am completely sick because of my sins. 
I'm drowning in guilt—the burden is too heavy to bear. 
My wounds are infected—they're smelling—all because of my stupidity. 
I am bent over, doubled up in pain. The whole day I walk around crying my eyes out. 
Inside I'm burning up with fever; no part of my body is healthy. 
I'm worn out, totally down. I groan because of the anguish I feel in my heart. 
Lord, you know what I desperately want, you hear every sigh I make. 
My heart is racing, leaving me with no strength; my eyesight is failing. 
My loved ones and my friends don't come near me because they're afraid of what I've got. Even my family keeps me at a distance. 
Those who are trying to kill me set traps for me; those who want to hurt me make threats against me, working on their deceitful schemes all day long. 
I act as if I'm deaf to what they're saying, and pretend to be dumb so I don't have to speak. 
Like a man who can't hear, and who doesn't reply—that's me! 
For I'm waiting on you, Lord! You will answer for me, my Lord and my God. 
I'm asking you, Lord, please don't let my enemies gloat over me, don't let them be glad when I trip up. 
For I'm about ready to collapse—the pain never stops. 
I do confess my sins; I am terribly sorry for what I've done. 
I have many powerful enemies—they are very active, hating me for no reason. 
They pay me back evil for good; they accuse me for the good I try to do. 
Don't give up on me, my Lord and my God, don't stay away from me. 
Hurry, come and help me, Lord my salvation.
