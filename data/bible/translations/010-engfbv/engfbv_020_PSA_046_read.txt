Chapter 46.
For the music director by the sons of Korah. According to alamoth, a song. God is our protection and our strength; always ready to help when troubles come. 
So we will not be afraid though the earth shakes, though the mountains fall into the depths of the sea, 
though the waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble as the waters surge violently! Selah. 
A river flows to bring happiness to those in God's city, the holy place where the Most High lives. 
God is in the midst of the city; it will never fall. God protects it as soon as it is light. 
Nations are in turmoil, kingdoms collapse. God raises his voice and the earth melts. 
The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob protects us. Selah. 
Come and see what the Lord has achieved! See the amazing things he has done on the earth! 
He stops wars all over the world. He smashes the bow; he breaks the spear; he sets shields on fire. 
Stop fighting! Recognize I am God! I am the ruler of the nations; I am the ruler of the earth. 
The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob protects us. Selah.
