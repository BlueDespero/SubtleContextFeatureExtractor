Chapter 36.
For the music director. A psalm of David, servant of the Lord. Evil speaks to the wicked, deep down in their minds, for in their eyes they have no need to respect God. 
In their own eyes they're so wonderful that they can't even see their sin and do something about it. 
Whatever they say is deceptive and deceitful. They no longer do anything wisely or for good. 
Even when they're lying in bed they think up evil schemes. They commit themselves to a way of life that is no good. They choose evil, and don't reject it. 
Lord, your faithful love reaches to the heavens, your trustworthiness to the clouds. 
Your goodness is like the highest mountains, your fairness is like the deepest oceans. Lord, you save both the people and the animals. 
God, how priceless is your trustworthy love! Everyone can find protection under the shelter of your wings. 
They gain strength from the wonderful food you provide in your house; you give them drink from your refreshing river. 
You are the source of life; you are the light by which we see. 
Extend your trustworthy love to those who know you, and your goodness to those who truly live right. 
Don't let the arrogant trample me down; don't let the wicked drive me out. 
Now look! See how those who do evil have fallen—thrown down, unable to get up.
