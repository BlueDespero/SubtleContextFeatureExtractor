Chapter 75.
For the music director. A psalm of Asaph. According to “Do Not Destroy.” A song. We thank you, God, we thank you because you are close beside us. People tell about the wonderful things you have done. 
God says, “When the time I have decided comes, I will judge fairly. 
When the earth quakes, and all its inhabitants tremble, I am the one who holds it steady. Selah. 
To those who boast I say, ‘Don't boast!’ I tell the wicked, ‘Don't be proud!’ 
No, don't be proud and arrogant, insulting heaven.” 
For no one, from the east to the west, or from the wilderness, should think so highly of themselves. 
God is the one who decides—who he will bring down and who he will lift up. 
For the Lord has a cup in his hand, full of bubbling wine mixed with spices. He pours it out, and all the wicked drink it deeply, down to the last drop. 
But I will speak about you forever. I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
For God says, “I will break the power of the wicked; but I will give my support to those who do what is good.”
