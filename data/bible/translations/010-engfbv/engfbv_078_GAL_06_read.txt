Galatians.
Chapter 6.
My friends, if someone is led astray by sin, you who are spiritual should bring them back with a gentle spirit. Watch out that you don't get tempted too. 
Carry each other's burdens, for in this way you fulfill the law of Christ. 
Those who think they're really something—when they're actually nothing—only fool themselves. 
Carefully examine your actions. Then you can be satisfied with yourself, without comparing yourself to anyone else. 
We have to take responsibility for ourselves. 
Those that are taught the Word should treat their teachers well, sharing with them all good things. 
Don't be fooled, God can't be treated with contempt: whatever you sow, that's what you reap. 
If you sow according to your sinful human nature, from that nature you'll reap self-destruction. But if you sow according to the Spirit, from the Spirit you'll reap eternal life. 
Let's never tire of doing good, for we'll reap a harvest at the proper time, if we don't give up. 
So while we have time, let's do good to everyone—especially to those who belong to the family of faith. 
Notice how big the letters are, now that I'm writing with my own hand! 
Those people who only want to make a good impression are forcing you to be circumcised just so they won't be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
Even those who are circumcised don't keep the law, but they want to have you circumcised so that they can boast about you and claim you as their followers. 
May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through this cross, the world has been crucified to me, and I've been crucified as far as the world is concerned. 
Circumcision or uncircumcision doesn't matter—what matters is that we're created brand new! 
Peace and mercy to all who follow this principle, and to the Israel of God! 
Please, don't anyone trouble me anymore, because I carry on my body the scars of Jesus. 
My brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
