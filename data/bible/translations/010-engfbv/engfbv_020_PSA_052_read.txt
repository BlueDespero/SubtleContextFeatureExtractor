Chapter 52.
For the music director. A psalm (maskil) of David, concerning the time when Doeg the Edomite went to Saul and told him, “David has gone to the home of Ahimelech.” You great man, why do you boast about the evil things you've done? God's trustworthy love lasts all day long. 
You plot to make people suffer; your words cut like a sharp razor, you liar! 
You love evil more than good, and telling lies more than speaking the truth. Selah. 
You love slanderous words that destroy others, you liar! 
But God will strike you down so hard you'll never get up. He will grab hold of you and drag you from your tent. He will tear you out of the land of the living. Selah. 
Those who do right will see all this. They will be astonished and laugh, saying, 
“See what happens to those who don't go to God for help but instead rely on their great wealth and strength—which only brings their destruction!” 
But I'm like an olive tree growing strongly in God's house. I trust in God's unfailing love forever and ever. 
I will praise you forever, God, for all you have done. In the presence of your trustworthy people, I will place my hope in the kind of person you are, for you are good.
