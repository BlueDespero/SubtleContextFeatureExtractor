Chapter 150.
Praise the Lord! Praise God in his holy place! Praise him in the great expanse of heaven! 
Praise him for the amazing things he does! Praise him for how wonderfully great he is! 
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet, praise him with harp and lyre! 
Praise him with tambourine and dancing, praise him with strings and flutes! 
Praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him with really loud cymbals! 
Let everything that breathes praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
