Chapter 51.
For the music director. A psalm of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba. God, please be gracious to me, because of your trustworthy love, because of your infinite kindness please wipe away my sins. 
Wash away all my guilt; cleanse me from my sin. 
I admit my rebellion; my sin always stares me in my face. 
I have sinned against you, you alone. I have done evil in your sight. So you are right in what you say, and fair when you judge. 
It's true that I was born guilty—sinful from the time my mother conceived me. 
But you want truth on the inside; you teach me wisdom deep within. 
Purify me with hyssop so I can be clean; wash me so I can be whiter than snow. 
Please let me hear joy and happiness again; let the bones you have crushed be glad once more. 
Turn your face away from looking at my sins; please wipe away my guilt. 
Create a pure mind in me, God, and make me trustworthy again. 
Don't expel me from your presence; don't take away your Holy Spirit from me. 
Give me back the happiness of your salvation; help me to have a willing nature. 
Then I will teach your ways to rebellious people, and these sinners will come back to you. 
God, please forgive me for the blood I have shed, God of my salvation, and I will sing for joy of your goodness. 
Open my lips so I can speak your praise! 
For sacrifices don't make you happy, or I would bring one; burnt offerings aren't what pleases you. 
The “sacrifices” that God wants are on the inside—the brokenness of repentance. God won't reject a broken and sorrowful heart. 
Be kind to Zion, help the city; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. 
Then you will be pleased with sacrifices given in the right spirit, for all kinds of burnt offerings, and bulls sacrificed on your altar once more.
