Chapter 9.
For the music director. According to Muth-labben. A psalm of David. I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all the amazing things you have done. 
I will be glad and celebrate in you; I will sing praises to your wonderful nature, Most High God. 
Those who hate me retreat; they fall back and die when you confront them. 
For you have judged that I am right; you have decided fairly from your throne of judgment. 
You have condemned the nations; you have destroyed the wicked; you have wiped out their names forever and ever. 
The enemies are finished, ruined forever; their cities are destroyed—even the memory of them is gone. 
But the Lord rules forever, his throne is set up for judgment. 
The Lord judges the world rightly; he judges the nations fairly. 
The Lord is a place of safety for those who are oppressed, a fortress in times of trouble. 
Those who know your nature trust in you, for you don't abandon those who come to you. 
Sing praises to the Lord who reigns in Zion! Tell the nations what he has done! 
He does not forget to punish murderers; he does not ignore the cries of the suffering. 
Be gracious to me, Lord! Look at how my enemies are persecuting me! Grab me back from the gates of death, 
so I can praise you at Zion's gates, happy that you have saved me. 
The nations have fallen into their own pit they dug; their feet are trapped by their own net they set. 
The Lord is known for his fairness; the wicked are trapped by their own actions. Higgaion. Selah. 
The wicked depart, going to the grave—all nations who turn their backs on God. 
But the needy will not be ignored forever, the hope of those who suffer will not always be dashed. 
Stand up, Lord! Don't let human beings win! Let the nations be brought before you for judgment! 
Lord, terrify them! Let them know they are only human! Selah.
