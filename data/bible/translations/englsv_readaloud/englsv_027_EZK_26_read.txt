Ezekiel.
Chapter 26.
And it comes to pass, in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, there has been a word of YHWH to me, saying, “Son of man, 
Because that Tyre has said of Jerusalem: Aha, she has been broken, || The doors of the peoples, || She has turned around to me, || I am filled—she has been laid waste, 
Therefore, thus said Lord YHWH: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, || And have caused many nations to come up against you, || As the sea causes its billows to come up. 
And they have destroyed the walls of Tyre, || And they have broken down her towers, || And I have scraped her dust from her, || And made her for a clear place of a rock. 
She is a spreading place of nets in the midst of the sea, || For I have spoken,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH, || “And she has been for a spoil to nations. 
And her daughters who are in the field, are slain by sword, || And they have known that I am YHWH,” 
For thus said Lord YHWH: “Behold, I am bringing Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Tyre, || From the north—a king of kings, || With horse, and with chariot, and with horsemen, || Even an assembly, and a numerous people. 
He slays your daughters in the field by sword, || And he has made a fort against you, || And has poured out a mound against you, || And has raised a buckler against you. 
And he places a battering-ram before him against your walls, || And he breaks your towers with his weapons. 
From the abundance of his horses their dust cover you, || From the noise of horseman, and wheel, and rider, || Your walls shake, in his coming into your gates, || As the coming into a city that has been broken-up. 
He treads all your out-places with the hooves of his horses, || He slays your people by sword, || And the pillars of your strength come down to the earth. 
And they have spoiled your wealth, || And they have plundered your merchandise, || And they have thrown down your walls, || And they break down your desirable houses, || And your stones, and your wood, and your dust, || They place in the midst of the waters. 
And I have caused the noise of your songs to cease, || And the voice of your harps is heard no more. 
And I have given you up for a clear place of a rock, || You are a spreading-place of nets, || You are not built up anymore, || For I, YHWH, have spoken,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
Thus said Lord YHWH to Tyre: “Do not—from the noise of your fall, || In the groaning of the wounded, || In the slaying of the slaughter in your midst—The islands shake? 
And all princes of the sea have come down from off their thrones, || And they have turned their robes aside, || And strip off their embroidered garments, || They put on trembling, || They sit on the earth, || And they have trembled every moment, || And they have been astonished at you, 
And have lifted up a lamentation for you, || And said to you: How you have perished, || That are inhabited from the seas, || The praised city, that was strong in the sea, || She and her inhabitants, || Who put their terror on all her inhabitants! 
Now the islands tremble on the day of your fall; The islands that are in the sea have been troubled at your outgoing.” 
For thus said Lord YHWH: “In My making you a city dried up, || Like cities that have not been inhabited, || In bringing up the deep against you, || Then the great waters have covered you. 
And I have caused you to go down, || With those going down to the pit, || To the people of old, || And I have caused you to dwell || In the lower parts of the earth—in ancient ruins, || With those going down to the pit, || So that you are not inhabited, || And I have given beauty in the land of the living. 
I make you a terror, and you are not, || And you are sought, and are not found anymore—for all time,” || A declaration of Lord YHWH!
