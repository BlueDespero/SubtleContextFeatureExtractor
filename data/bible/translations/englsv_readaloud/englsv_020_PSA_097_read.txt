Psalms.
Chapter 97.
YHWH has reigned, || The earth is joyful, many islands rejoice. 
Cloud and darkness are around Him, || Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne. 
Fire goes before Him, || And burns around His adversaries. 
His lightnings have lightened the world, || The earth has seen, and is pained. 
Hills, like wax, melted before YHWH, || Before the Lord of all the earth. 
The heavens declared His righteousness, || And all the peoples have seen His glory. 
All servants of a carved image are ashamed, || Those boasting themselves in idols, || Bow yourselves to Him, all you gods. 
Zion has heard and rejoices, || And daughters of Judah are joyful, || Because of Your judgments, O YHWH. 
For You, YHWH, are Most High over all the earth, || You have been exalted greatly over all gods. 
You who love YHWH, hate evil, || He is keeping the souls of His saints, || He delivers them from the hand of the wicked. 
Light is sown for the righteous, || And joy for the upright of heart. 
Rejoice, you righteous, in YHWH, || And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness!
