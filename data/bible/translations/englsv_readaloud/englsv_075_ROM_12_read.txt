Romans.
Chapter 12.
I call on you, therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice—living, sanctified, acceptable to God—your intelligent service; 
and do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what is the will of God—the good, and acceptable, and perfect. 
For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think above what it ought to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God dealt a measure of faith, 
for as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same office, 
so we, the many, are one body in Christ, and members of one another—each one. 
And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us: whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith; 
or ministry, in the ministry; or he who is teaching, in the teaching; 
or he who is exhorting, in the exhortation; he who is sharing, in simplicity; he who is leading, in diligence; he who is doing kindness, in cheerfulness. 
The love unhypocritical: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good; 
in the love of brothers, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honor going before one another; 
in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; serving the LORD; 
in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering; 
to the necessities of the holy ones communicating; the hospitality pursuing. 
Bless those persecuting you; bless, and do not curse; 
to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping, 
of the same mind toward one another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; do not become wise in your own conceit; 
giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men. 
If possible—so far as in you—with all men being in peace; 
not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it has been written: “Vengeance is Mine, 
I will repay again, says the LORD”; if, then, your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him drink; for doing this, you will heap coals of fire on his head. 
Do not be overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil.
