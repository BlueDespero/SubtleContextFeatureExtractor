Psalms.
Chapter 64.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, || You keep my life from the fear of an enemy, 
Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, || From the tumult of workers of iniquity. 
Who sharpened their tongue as a sword, || They directed their arrow—a bitter word. 
To shoot the perfect in secret places, || Suddenly they shoot him, and do not fear. 
They strengthen an evil thing for themselves, || They recount of the hiding of snares, || They have said, “Who looks at it?” 
They search out perverse things, “We perfected a searching search,” || And the inward part of man, and the heart, are deep. 
And God shoots them with an arrow, || Their wounds have been sudden, 
And they cause him to stumble, || Their own tongue is against them, || Every looker on them flees away. 
And all men fear, and declare the work of God, || And they have wisely considered His deed. 
The righteous rejoice in YHWH, || And have trusted in Him, || And all the upright of heart boast!
