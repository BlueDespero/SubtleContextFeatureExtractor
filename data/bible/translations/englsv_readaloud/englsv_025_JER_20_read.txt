Jeremiah.
Chapter 20.
And Pashhur son of Immer the priest—who is also overseer, leader in the house of YHWH—hears Jeremiah prophesying these things, 
and Pashhur strikes Jeremiah the prophet, and puts him in the stocks that are by the Upper Gate of Benjamin, that is by the house of YHWH. 
And it comes to pass on the next day, that Pashhur brings Jeremiah out from the stocks, and Jeremiah says to him, “YHWH has not called your name Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side. 
For thus said YHWH: Behold, I am making you for a fear to yourself, || And to all loving you, || And they have fallen by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes are beholding, || And all Judah I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, || And he has removed them to Babylon, || And he has struck them with the sword. 
And I have given all the strength of this city, || And all its labor, and all its precious things, || Indeed, I give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, || And they have spoiled them, and taken them, || And have brought them into Babylon. 
And you, Pashhur, and all dwelling in your house, || Go into captivity. And you enter Babylon, || And there you die, and there you are buried, || You and all loving you, || To whom you have prophesied falsely.” 
You have persuaded me, O YHWH, and I am persuaded; You have hardened me, and prevail, || I have been for a laughter all the day, || Everyone is mocking at me, 
Because from the time I speak I cry out, I shout, “Violence and destruction!” || For the word of YHWH has been to me || For reproach and for derision all the day. 
And I said, “I do not mention Him, || Nor do I speak anymore in His Name,” || And it has been in my heart || As a burning fire shut up in my bones, || And I have been weary of containing, || And I am not able. 
For I have heard the evil report of many, “Fear is all around!” “Declare, and we declare it!” All my allies are watching for my halting, “Perhaps he is enticed, and we prevail over him, || And we take our vengeance on him.” 
And YHWH is with me, as a mighty, awesome One, || Therefore my persecutors stumble and do not prevail, || They have been exceedingly ashamed, || For they have not acted wisely, || Continuous confusion is not forgotten. 
And, O YHWH of Hosts, trier of the righteous, || Beholder of reins and heart, || I see Your vengeance on them, || For I have revealed my cause to you. 
Sing to YHWH, praise YHWH, || For He has delivered the soul of the needy || From the hand of evildoers. 
Cursed is the day in which I was born, || The day that my mother bore me, || Let it not be blessed! 
Cursed is the man who bore tidings to my father, || Saying, “A male child has been born to you,” || Making him very glad! 
Then that man has been as the cities, || That YHWH overthrew, and did not relent, || And he has heard a cry in the morning, || And a shout at noontime. 
Because he has not put me to death from the womb, || And my mother is to me—my grave, || And her womb is a perpetual pregnancy. 
Why is this? I have come out from the womb || To see labor and sorrow, || Indeed, my days are consumed in shame!
