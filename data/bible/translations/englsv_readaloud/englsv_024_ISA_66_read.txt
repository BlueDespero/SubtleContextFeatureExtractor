Isaiah.
Chapter 66.
Thus said YHWH: “The heavens are My throne, || And the earth My footstool, || Where is this—the house that you build for Me? And where is this—the place—My rest? 
And My hand has made all these, || And all these things are,” || A declaration of YHWH! “And to this one I look attentively, || To the humble and bruised in spirit, || And who is trembling at My word. 
Whoever slaughters the ox strikes a man, || Whoever sacrifices the lamb beheads a dog, || Whoever is bringing up a present—The blood of a sow, || Whoever is making mention of frankincense, || Is blessing iniquity. Indeed, they have fixed on their own ways, || And their soul has delighted in their abominations. 
I also—I fix on their distress, || And I bring in their fears to them, || Because I have called, and there is none answering, || I spoke, and they have not listened, || And they do evil in My eyes, || And on that which I did not desire—fixed.” 
Hear a word of YHWH, || You who are trembling at His word: “Your brothers who are hating you, || Who are driving you out for My Name’s sake, have said, || YHWH is honored, and we look on your joy, || But they are ashamed.” 
A voice of noise from the city, || A voice from the temple, || The voice of YHWH, || Giving repayment to His enemies. 
“Before she is pained she has brought forth, || Before a pang comes to her, || She has delivered a male. 
Who has heard anything like this? Who has seen anything like these? Is earth caused to bring forth in one day? Is a nation born at once? For she has been pained, || Zion has also borne her sons. 
Do I bring to the birth, || And not cause to bring forth?” says YHWH, || “Am I not He who is causing to beget? I have also restrained,” said your God. 
“Rejoice with Jerusalem, || And be glad in her, all you loving her, || Rejoice with her for joy, || All you who are mourning for her, 
So that you suckle, and have been satisfied, || From the breast of her consolations, || So that you wring out, and have delighted yourselves || From the abundance of her glory.” 
For thus said YHWH: “Behold, I am stretching out to her peace as a river, || And the glory of nations as an overflowing stream, || And you have sucked, || You are carried on the side, || And you are dandled on the knees. 
As one whom his mother comforts, so do I comfort you, || Indeed, you are comforted in Jerusalem.” 
And you have seen, and your heart has rejoiced, || And your bones flourish as tender grass, || And the hand of YHWH has been known to His servants, || And He has been indignant with His enemies. 
For behold, YHWH comes in fire, || And His chariots as a windstorm, || To refresh His anger in fury, || And His rebuke in flames of fire. 
For by fire and by His sword, || YHWH does judgment with all flesh. And many have been YHWH’s pierced ones. 
“Those sanctifying and cleansing themselves to go to the gardens, || One after another in the midst, || Eating flesh of the sow, || And of the abomination, and of the muroid, || Are consumed together,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“And I—their works and their thoughts, || I come to gather all the nations and tongues, || And they have come and seen My glory. 
And I have set a sign among them, || And have sent out of them those escaping to the nations || (Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing bow, Tubal and Javan, the islands that are far off), || Who have not heard My fame, nor seen My glory, || And they have declared My glory among nations. 
And they have brought all your brothers out of all the nations, || A present to YHWH, || On horses, and on chariot, and on litters, || And on mules, and on dromedaries, || To My holy mountain Jerusalem,” said YHWH, “As the sons of Israel bring the present in a clean vessel, || Into the house of YHWH. 
And I also take of them for priests, || For Levites,” said YHWH. 
“For as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making, || Are standing before Me,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “So your seed and your name remain. 
And it has been from month to month, || And from Sabbath to Sabbath, || All flesh come to bow themselves before Me,” said YHWH. 
“And they have gone forth, || And looked on the carcasses of the men || Who are transgressing against Me, || For their worm does not die, || And their fire is not quenched, || And they have been an abhorrence to all flesh!”
