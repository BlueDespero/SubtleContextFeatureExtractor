Psalms.
Chapter 39.
TO THE OVERSEER. FOR JEDUTHUN. A PSALM OF DAVID. I have said, “I observe my ways, || Against sinning with my tongue, || I keep a curb for my mouth, || While the wicked is before me.” 
I was mute with silence, || I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited. 
My heart is hot within me, || In my meditating the fire burns, || I have spoken with my tongue. 
“Cause me to know, O YHWH, my end, || And the measure of my days—what it is,” || I know how frail I am. 
Behold, You have made my days handbreadths, || And my age is as nothing before You, || Only, every man set up is all vanity. Selah. 
Only, each habitually walks in an image, || Only, in vain, they are disquieted, || He heaps up and does not know who gathers them. 
And now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope—it is of You. 
Deliver me from all my transgressions, || Do not make me a reproach of the fool. 
I have been mute, I do not open my mouth, || Because You have done it. 
Turn aside Your stroke from off me, || From the striving of Your hand I have been consumed. 
With reproofs against iniquity, || You have corrected man, || And dissolve his desirableness as a moth, || Only, every man is vanity. Selah. 
Hear my prayer, O YHWH, || And give ear to my cry, || Do not be silent to my tear, || For I am a sojourner with You, || A settler like all my fathers. 
Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!
