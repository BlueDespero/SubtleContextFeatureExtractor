Zechariah.
Chapter 7.
And it comes to pass, in the fourth year of Darius the king, a word of YHWH has been to Zechariah, in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chisleu. 
And Beth-El sends Sherezer and Regem-Melech, and its men, to appease the face of YHWH, 
speaking to the priests who are at the house of YHWH of Hosts, and to the prophets, saying, “Do I weep in the fifth month—being separated—as I have done these so many years?” 
And there is a word of YHWH of Hosts to me, saying, 
“Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, 
When you fasted with mourning in the fifth and in the seventh months—even these seventy years—did you keep the fast to Me? And when you eat, and when you drink, is it not you who are eating, and you who are drinking? 
Are these not the words that YHWH proclaimed by the hand of the former prophets, in Jerusalem’s being inhabited, and in safety, and its cities around it, and the south and the plain—abiding?” 
And there is a word of YHWH to Zechariah, saying, 
“Thus spoke YHWH of Hosts, saying, || Judge with true judgment, || And do kindness and mercy with one another. 
And do not oppress widow, and fatherless, || Sojourner, and poor, || And you do not devise the calamity of one another in your heart. 
And they refuse to attend, || And they give a stubborn shoulder, || And their ears are made heavy against hearing. 
And their heart they have made adamant, || Against hearing the Law, and the words, || That YHWH of Hosts sent by His Spirit, || By the hand of the former prophets, || And there is great wrath from YHWH of Hosts. 
And it comes to pass, as He called, || And they have not listened, || So they call, and I do not listen,” said YHWH of Hosts. 
“And I toss them on all the nations, || That they have not known, || The land has been desolate behind them, || Of any passing by and turning back, || And they set a desirable land for a desolation!”
