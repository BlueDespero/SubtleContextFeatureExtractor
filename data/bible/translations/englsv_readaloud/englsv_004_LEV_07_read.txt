Leviticus.
Chapter 7.
“And this is a law of the guilt-offering: it is most holy; 
in the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering they slaughter the guilt-offering, and he sprinkles its blood on the altar all around, 
and he brings near all its fat from it, the fat tail, and the fat which is covering the innards, 
and the two kidneys, and the fat which is on them, which is on the flanks, and the redundance on the liver above the kidneys—he turns it aside; 
and the priest has made them an incense on the altar, a fire-offering to YHWH; it is a guilt-offering. 
Every male among the priests eats it; it is eaten in a holy place—it is most holy; 
as is a sin-offering, so is a guilt-offering; one law is for them; the priest who makes atonement by it—it is his. 
And the priest who is bringing any man’s burnt-offering near, the skin of the burnt-offering which he has brought near, it is the priest’s, his own; 
and every present which is baked in an oven, and all done in a frying-pan, and on a griddle, is the priest’s who is bringing it near; it is his; 
and every present, mixed with oil or dry, is for all the sons of Aaron—one as another. 
And this is a law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which one brings near to YHWH: 
if he brings it near for a thank-offering, then he has brought near with the sacrifice of thank-offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and of stirred flour cakes mixed with oil; 
besides the cakes, he brings fermented bread near with his offering, besides the sacrifice of thank-offering of his peace-offerings; 
and he has brought near from it one cake from every offering as a raised-offering to YHWH for the priest who is sprinkling the blood of the peace-offerings; it is for him; 
as for the flesh of the sacrifice of the thank-offering of his peace-offerings, it is eaten in the day of his offering; he does not leave of it until morning. 
And if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or free-will offering, it is eaten in the day of his bringing his sacrifice near; and on the next day the remnant of it is also eaten; 
and the remnant of the flesh of the sacrifice is burned with fire on the third day; 
and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it is not pleasing; it is not reckoned for him who is bringing it near; it is an abomination, and the person who is eating of it bears his iniquity. 
And the flesh which comes against any unclean thing is not eaten; it is burned with fire; as for the flesh, every clean one eats of the flesh; 
and the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which are YHWH’s, and his uncleanness is on him, indeed, that person has been cut off from his people. 
And when a person comes against anything unclean, of the uncleanness of man, or of the uncleanness of beasts, or of any unclean teeming creature, and has eaten of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which are YHWH’s, indeed, that person has been cut off from his people.” 
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, You do not eat any fat of ox, and sheep, and goat; 
and the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a torn thing, is prepared for any work, but you certainly do not eat it; 
for whoever eats the fat of the beast, of which one brings near as a fire-offering to YHWH, indeed, the person who eats it has been cut off from his people. 
And you do not eat any blood in all your dwellings, of bird, or of beast; 
any person who eats any blood, indeed, that person has been cut off from his people.” 
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, He who is bringing the sacrifice of his peace-offerings near to YHWH brings in his offering to YHWH from the sacrifice of his peace-offerings; 
his own hands bring in the fire-offerings of YHWH; the fat beside the breast—he brings it in with the breast to wave it as a wave-offering before YHWH. 
And the priest has made incense with the fat on the altar, and the breast has been Aaron’s and his sons; 
and you give the right leg to the priest as a raised-offering of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; 
he from the sons of Aaron who is bringing the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat near—the right leg is for a portion for him. 
For I have taken the breast of the wave-offering and the leg of the raised-offering from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and I give them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a continuous statute, from the sons of Israel.” 
This is an anointed portion for Aaron, and an anointed portion for his sons out of the fire-offerings of YHWH, in the day he has brought them near to act as priest of YHWH, 
which YHWH has commanded to give to them from the sons of Israel, in the day of His anointing them—a continuous statute throughout their generations. 
This is the law for burnt-offering, for present, and for sin-offering, and for guilt-offering, and for consecrations, and for a sacrifice of the peace-offerings, 
which YHWH has commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day of His commanding the sons of Israel to bring their offerings near to YHWH, in the wilderness of Sinai.
