Psalms.
Chapter 23.
A PSALM OF DAVID. YHWH is my shepherd, I do not lack, 
He causes me to lie down in pastures of tender grass, || He leads me by quiet waters. 
He refreshes my soul, || He leads me in paths of righteousness || For His Name’s sake; 
Also—when I walk in a valley of death-shade, || I fear no evil, for You are with me, || Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me. 
You arrange a table before me, || In front of my adversaries, || You have anointed my head with oil, || My cup is full! 
Surely goodness and kindness pursue me || All the days of my life, || And my dwelling is in the house of YHWH, || For the length of my days!
