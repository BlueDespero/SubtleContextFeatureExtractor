Song of Songs.
Chapter 2.
As a lily among the thorns, 
So is my friend among the daughters! 
As a citron among trees of the forest, || So is my beloved among the sons, || In his shade I delighted, and sat down, || And his fruit is sweet to my palate. 
He has brought me to a house of wine, || And his banner over me is love, 
Sustain me with grape-cakes, || Support me with citrons, for I am sick with love. 
His left hand is under my head, || And his right embraces me. 
I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, || By the roes or by the does of the field, || Do not stir up nor wake the love until she pleases! 
The voice of my beloved! Behold, this—he is coming, || Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills. 
My beloved is like to a roe, || Or to a young one of the harts. Behold, this—he is standing behind our wall, || Looking from the windows, || Blooming from the lattice. 
My beloved has answered and said to me, || “Rise up, my friend, my beautiful one, and come away, 
For behold, the winter has passed by, || The rain has passed away—it has gone. 
The flowers have appeared in the earth, || The time of the singing has come, || And the voice of the turtle was heard in our land, 
The fig tree has ripened her green figs, || And the sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, || Rise, come, my friend, my beautiful one, indeed, come away. 
My dove, in clefts of the rock, || In a secret place of the ascent, || Cause me to see your appearance, || Cause me to hear your voice, || For your voice is sweet, and your appearance lovely.” 
Seize for us foxes, || Little foxes—destroyers of vineyards, || Even our sweet-smelling vineyards. 
My beloved is mine, and I am his, || Who is delighting among the lilies, 
Until the day breaks forth, || And the shadows have fled away, || Turn, be like, my beloved, || To a roe, or to a young one of the harts, || On the mountains of separation!
