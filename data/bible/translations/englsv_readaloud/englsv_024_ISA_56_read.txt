Isaiah.
Chapter 56.
Thus said YHWH: “Keep judgment, and do righteousness, || For My salvation is near to come, || And My righteousness to be revealed.” 
O the blessedness of a man who does this, || And of a son of man who keeps hold on it, || Keeping the Sabbath from defiling it, || And keeping his hand from doing any evil. 
Do not let a son of the stranger speak, || Who is joined to YHWH, saying, “YHWH certainly separates me from His people.” Nor let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dried up tree,” 
For thus said YHWH: “To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, || And have fixed on that which I desired, || And are keeping hold on My covenant: 
I have given to them in My house, || And within My walls a station and a name, || Better than sons and than daughters, || I give a continuous name to him || That is not cut off. 
And sons of the stranger, who are joined to YHWH, || To serve Him, and to love the Name of YHWH, || To be for servants to Him, || All keeping from defiling the Sabbath, || And those keeping hold on My covenant, 
I have brought them to My holy mountain, || And caused them to rejoice in My house of prayer, || Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices || Are for a pleasing thing on My altar, || For My house is called a house of prayer for all the peoples.” 
A declaration of Lord YHWH, || Who is gathering the outcasts of Israel: “Again I gather to him—to his gathered ones.” 
Every beast of the field, || Come to devour, every beast in the forest. 
His watchmen are blind—all of them, || They have not known, || All of them are mute dogs, they are not able to bark, || Dozing, lying down, loving to slumber. 
And the dogs are strong of desire, || They have not known sufficiency, || And they are shepherds! They have not known understanding, || All of them turned to their own way, || Each to his dishonest gain from his quarter: 
“Come, I take wine, || And we drink, gulp strong drink, || And tomorrow has been as this day, || Great—exceedingly abundant!”
