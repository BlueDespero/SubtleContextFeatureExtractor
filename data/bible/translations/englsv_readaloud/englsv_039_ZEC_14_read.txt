Zechariah.
Chapter 14.
Behold, a day has come to YHWH, || And your spoil has been divided in your midst. 
And I have gathered all the nations to Jerusalem to battle, || And the city has been captured, || And the houses have been spoiled, || And the women are lain with, || Half the city has gone forth in a removal, || And the remnant of the people are not cut off from the city. 
And YHWH has gone forth, || And He has fought against those nations, || As in the day of His fighting in a day of conflict. 
And His feet have stood, in that day, || On the Mount of Olives, || That is eastward before Jerusalem, || And the Mount of Olives has been cleft at its midst, || To the east, and to the west, a very great valley, || And half of the mountain is removed toward the north, || And half toward the south. 
And you have fled to the valley of My mountains, || For the valley of the mountains joins to Azal, || And you have fled as you fled before the shaking, || In the days of Uzziah king of Judah, || And my God YHWH has come in, || All holy ones are with You. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || The precious light is not, it is dense darkness, 
And there has been one day, || It is known to YHWH, not day nor night, || And it has been at evening-time—there is light. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || Living waters go forth from Jerusalem, || Half of them to the Eastern Sea, || And half of them to the Western Sea, || It is in summer and in winter. 
And YHWH has become King over all the earth, || In that day YHWH is one, and His Name one. 
All the land is changed as a plain, || From Gebo to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, || And she has been high, and has dwelt in her place, || Even from the Gate of Benjamin || To the place of the first gate, to the front gate, || And from the Tower of Hananeel, || To the wine-vats of the king. 
And they have dwelt in her, || And destruction is no more, || And Jerusalem has dwelt confidently. 
And this is the plague with which YHWH plagues all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: He has consumed away its flesh, || And it is standing on its feet, || And its eyes are consumed in their holes, || And its tongue is consumed in their mouth. 
And it has come to pass in that day, || A great destruction from YHWH is among them, || And they have each seized the hand of his neighbor, || And his hand has gone up against the hand of his neighbor. 
And also Judah is fought with in Jerusalem, || And the force of all the surrounding nations has been gathered, || Gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. 
And so is the plague of the horse, of the mule, || Of the camel, and of the donkey, || And of all the livestock that are in these camps, || As this plague. 
And it has come to pass, || Everyone who has been left of all the nations, || Who are coming in against Jerusalem, || They have also gone up from year to year, || To bow themselves to the King, YHWH of Hosts, || And to celebrate the Celebration of the Shelters. 
And it has come to pass, || That he who does not go up of the families of the land to Jerusalem, || To bow himself to the King, YHWH of Hosts, || Even on them there is no shower. 
And if the family of Egypt does not go up, nor come in, || Then on them is the plague || With which YHWH plagues the nations || That do not go up to celebrate the Celebration of Shelters. 
This is the punishment of the sin of Egypt, || And the punishment of the sin of all the nations, || That do not go up to celebrate the Celebration of Shelters. 
In that day “Holy to YHWH” is engraved on bells of the horse, || And the pots in the house of YHWH || Have been as bowls before the altar. 
And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah, || Have been holy to YHWH of Hosts, || And all those sacrificing have come in, || And have taken of them, and boiled in them, || And in that day there is no merchant anymore in the house of YHWH of Hosts!
