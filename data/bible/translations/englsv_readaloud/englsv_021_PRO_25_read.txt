Proverbs.
Chapter 25.
These are also proverbs of Solomon, that men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed: 
The glory of God is to hide a thing, || And the glory of kings is to search out a matter. 
The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, || And the heart of kings—are unsearchable. 
Take away dross from silver, || And a vessel goes forth for the refiner, 
Take away the wicked before a king, || And his throne is established in righteousness. 
Do not honor yourself before a king, || And do not stand in the place of the great. 
For better that he has said to you, “Come up here,” || Than that he humbles you before a noble, || Whom your eyes have seen. 
Do not go forth to strive, hurry, turn, || What do you do in its latter end, || When your neighbor causes you to blush? 
Plead your cause with your neighbor, || And do not reveal the secret counsel of another, 
Lest the hearer put you to shame, || And your evil report not turn back. 
Apples of gold in imagery of silver, || Is the word spoken at its fit times. 
A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure gold, || Is the wise reprover to an attentive ear. 
As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest, || So is a faithful ambassador to those sending him, || And he refreshes the soul of his masters. 
Clouds and wind without rain, || Is a man boasting himself in a false gift. 
A ruler is persuaded by long-suffering, || And a soft tongue breaks a bone. 
You have found honey—eat your sufficiency, || Lest you are satiated with it, and have vomited it. 
Withdraw your foot from your neighbor’s house, || Lest he is satiated with you, and has hated you. 
A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, || Is the man testifying a false testimony against his neighbor. 
A bad tooth, and a tottering foot, || Is the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity. 
Whoever is taking away a garment in a cold day, || Is as vinegar on natron, || And a singer of songs on a sad heart. 
If he who is hating you hungers, cause him to eat bread, || And if he thirsts, cause him to drink water. 
For you are putting coals on his head, || And YHWH gives repayment to you. 
A north wind brings forth rain, || And a secret tongue—indignant faces. 
Better to sit on a corner of a roof, || Than with a woman of contentions, and a house of company. 
As cold waters for a weary soul, || So is a good report from a far country. 
A spring troubled, and a fountain corrupt, || Is the righteous falling before the wicked. 
The eating of much honey is not good, || Nor a searching out of one’s own honor—honor. 
A city broken down without walls, || Is a man without restraint over his spirit!
