Psalms.
Chapter 54.
TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. AN INSTRUCTION OF DAVID, IN THE COMING IN OF THE ZIPHIM, AND THEY SAY TO SAUL, “IS DAVID NOT HIDING HIMSELF WITH US?” O God, save me by Your Name, and judge me by Your might. 
O God, hear my prayer, || Give ear to the sayings of my mouth, 
For strangers have risen up against me || And terrible ones have sought my soul, || They have not set God before them. Selah. 
Behold, God is a helper to me, || The Lord is with those supporting my soul, 
Turn back the evil to my enemies, || Cut them off in Your truth. 
I sacrifice to You with a free-will offering, || I thank Your Name, O YHWH, for it is good, 
For He delivered me from all adversity, || And my eye has looked on my enemies!
