Proverbs.
Chapter 16.
Arrangements of the heart are of man, || An answer of the tongue from YHWH. 
All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, || And YHWH is pondering the spirits. 
Roll your works to YHWH, || And your purposes are established, 
YHWH has worked all things for Himself, || And also the wicked—for a day of evil. 
Every proud one of heart is an abomination to YHWH, || Hand to hand—he is not acquitted. 
Iniquity is pardoned in kindness and truth, || And in the fear of YHWH || Turn aside from evil. 
When a man’s ways please YHWH, even his enemies, || He causes to be at peace with him. 
Better is a little with righteousness, || Than abundance of increase without justice. 
The heart of man devises his way, || And YHWH establishes his step. 
An oath is on the lips of a king, || In judgment his mouth does not trespass. 
A just beam and balances are YHWH’s, || All the stones of the bag are His work. 
Doing wickedness is an abomination to kings, || For a throne is established by righteousness. 
Righteous lips are the delight of kings, || And he loves whoever is speaking uprightly, 
The fury of a king is messengers of death, || And a wise man pacifies it. 
In the light of a king’s face is life, || And his goodwill is as a cloud of the spring rain. 
To get wisdom—how much better than gold, || And to get understanding—to be chosen more than silver! 
A highway of the upright is to turn from evil, || Whoever is preserving his soul is watching his way. 
Pride is before destruction, || And before stumbling—a haughty spirit. 
Better is humility of spirit with the poor, || Than to apportion spoil with the proud. 
The wise in any matter finds good, || And whoever is trusting in YHWH, O his blessedness. 
For the wise in heart is called intelligent, || And sweetness of lips increases learning. 
Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessors, || The instruction of fools is folly. 
The heart of the wise causes his mouth to act wisely, || And he increases learning by his lips, 
Sayings of pleasantness are a honeycomb, || Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone. 
There is a way right before a man, || And its latter end—ways of death. 
A laboring man has labored for himself, || For his mouth has caused him to bend over it. 
A worthless man is preparing evil, || And on his lips is as a burning fire. 
A contrary man sends forth contention, || A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend. 
A violent man entices his neighbor, || And causes him to go in a way that is not good. 
Consulting his eyes to devise contrary things, || Moving his lips he has accomplished evil. 
Grey hairs are a crown of beauty, || It is found in the way of righteousness. 
Better is the one slow to anger than the mighty, || And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city. 
The lot is cast into the center, || And all its judgment is from YHWH!
