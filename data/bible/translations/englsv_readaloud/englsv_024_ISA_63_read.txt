Isaiah.
Chapter 63.
Who is this coming from Edom? With dyed garments from Bozrah? This that is honorable in His clothing, || Traveling in the abundance of His power? “I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.” 
Why is Your clothing red? And Your garments as treading in a winepress? 
“I have trodden a wine vat by Myself, || And of the peoples there is no one with Me, || And I tread them in My anger, || And I trample them in My fury, || Their strength is sprinkled on My garments, || And I have defiled all My clothing. 
For the day of vengeance is in My heart, || And the year of My redeemed has come. 
And I look attentively, and there is none helping, || And I am astonished that there is none supporting, || And My own arm gives salvation to Me. And My wrath—it has supported Me. 
And I tread down peoples in My anger, || And I make them drunk in My fury, || And I bring down their strength to earth.” 
I make mention of the kind acts of YHWH, || The praises of YHWH, || According to all that YHWH has done for us, || And the abundance of the goodness to the house of Israel, || That He has done for them, || According to His mercies, || And according to the abundance of His kind acts. 
And He says, “Surely they are My people, || Sons—they do not lie,” and He is to them for a Savior. 
In all their distress He is no adversary, || And the Messenger of His Presence saved them, || In His love and in His pity He redeemed them, || And He lifts them up, || And carries them all the days of old. 
And they have been rebellious and have grieved His Holy Spirit, || And He turns to them for an enemy, || He Himself has fought against them. 
And He remembers the days of old, || Moses—his people. Where is He who is bringing them up from the sea, || The shepherd of His flock? Where is He who is putting in its midst His Holy Spirit? 
Leading by the right hand of Moses, the arm of His glory, || Cleaving waters from before them, || To make to Himself a continuous Name. 
Leading them through the depths, || They do not stumble as a horse in a plain. 
As a beast goes down into a valley, || The Spirit of YHWH causes him to rest, || So You have led Your people, || To make to Yourself a glorious Name. 
Look attentively from the heavens, || And see from Your holy and beautiful habitation, || Where is Your zeal and Your might? The multitude of Your bowels and Your mercies—Are they restrained? 
For You are our Father, || For Abraham has not known us, || And Israel does not acknowledge us, || You, O YHWH, are our Father, || Our Redeemer from the Age, is Your Name. 
Why cause us to wander, O YHWH, from Your ways? You harden our heart from Your fear, || Turn back for Your servants’ sake, || The tribes of Your inheritance. 
For a little while Your holy people possessed, || Our adversaries have trodden down Your sanctuary. 
We have been from of old, || You have not ruled over them, || Your Name is not called on them!
