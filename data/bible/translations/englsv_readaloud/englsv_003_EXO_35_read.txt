Exodus.
Chapter 35.
And Moses assembles all the congregation of the sons of Israel and says to them, “These are the things which YHWH has commanded—to do them: 
For six days work is done, and on the seventh day there is a holy day for you, a Sabbath of rest to YHWH; any who does work in it is put to death; 
you do not burn a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.” 
And Moses speaks to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which YHWH has commanded, saying, 
Take a raised-offering for YHWH from among you; everyone whose heart is willing brings it as the raised-offering of YHWH: gold, and silver, and bronze, 
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats’ hair, 
and rams’ skins made red, and tachashim skins, and shittim wood, 
and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the spice-incense, 
and shoham stones, and stones for settings, for an ephod, and for a breastplate. 
And all the wise-hearted among you come in, and make all that YHWH has commanded: 
the Dwelling Place, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets, 
the Ark and its poles, the propitiatory covering, and the veil of the covering, 
the table and its poles, and all its vessels, and the Bread of the Presentation, 
and the lampstand for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light, 
and the altar of incense, and its poles, and the anointing oil, and the spice-incense, and the covering of the opening at the opening of the Dwelling Place, 
the altar of burnt-offering and the bronze grate which it has, its poles, and all its vessels, the laver and its base, 
the hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the covering of the gate of the court, 
the pins of the Dwelling Place, and the pins of the court, and their cords, 
the colored garments, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to act as priest in.” 
And all the congregation of the sons of Israel go out from the presence of Moses, 
and they come in—every man whom his heart has lifted up, and everyone whom his spirit has made willing—they have brought in the raised-offering of YHWH for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments. 
And they come in—the men with the women—every willing-hearted one—they have brought in nose-ring, and earring, and seal-ring, and necklace, all golden goods, even everyone who has waved a wave-offering of gold to YHWH. 
And every man with whom has been found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats’ hair, and rams’ skins made red, and tachashim skins, have brought them in; 
everyone lifting up a raised-offering of silver and bronze has brought in the raised-offering of YHWH; and everyone with whom has been found shittim wood for any work of the service brought it in. 
And every wise-hearted woman has spun with her hands, and they bring in yarn—of the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet—and the linen; 
and all the women whose heart has lifted them up in wisdom, have spun the goats’ hair. 
And the princes have brought in the shoham stones, and the stones for settings, for the ephod, and for the breastplate, 
and the spices, and the oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the spice-incense; 
every man and woman of the sons of Israel (whom their heart has made willing to bring in for all the work which YHWH commanded to be done by the hand of Moses) brought in a willing-offering to YHWH. 
And Moses says to the sons of Israel, “See, YHWH has called Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, by name, 
and He fills him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work, 
even to devise inventions to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 
and in a carving of stones for settings, and in a carving of wood to work in any work of design. 
And He has put it in his heart to direct, he and Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; 
He has filled them with wisdom of heart to do every work, of engraver, and designer, and embroiderer (in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in linen), and weaver, who does any work, and of designers of designs.”
