Zechariah.
Chapter 10.
They asked of YHWH rain || In a time of spring rain, || YHWH is making lightnings, || And He gives to them rain in showers. To each—the herb in the field. 
Because the teraphim spoke iniquity, || And the diviners have seen a falsehood, || And dreams of the vanity they speak, || With vanity they give comfort, || Therefore they have journeyed as a flock, || They are afflicted, for there is no shepherd. 
“My anger burned against the shepherds, || And I lay a charge against the male goats, || For YHWH of Hosts has inspected His flock, the house of Judah, || And set them as His splendid horse in battle. 
From him is a cornerstone, || From him a nail, from him a battle-bow, || From him goes forth every exactor together. 
And they have been as heroes, || Treading in mire of out-places in battle, || And they have fought, for YHWH is with them, || And have put to shame riders of horses. 
And I have made the house of Judah mighty, || And I save the house of Joseph, || And I have caused them to dwell, for I have loved them, || And they have been as if I had not cast them off, || For I am their God YHWH, || And I answer them. 
And Ephraim has been as a hero, || And their heart has rejoiced as wine, || And their sons see, and they have rejoiced, || Their heart rejoices in YHWH. 
I hiss for them, and I gather them, || For I have redeemed them, || And they have multiplied as they multiplied. 
And I sow them among peoples, || And in far-off places they remember Me, || And they have lived with their sons, || And they have turned back. 
And I have brought them back from the land of Egypt, || And I gather them from Asshur, || And I bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, || And space is not found for them there. 
And He has passed over through the sea, || And has pressed and struck billows in the sea, || And all depths of a flood have been dried up, || And the excellence of Asshur has been brought down, || And the rod of Egypt turns aside. 
And I have made them mighty in YHWH, || And in His Name they walk up and down,” || A declaration of YHWH!
