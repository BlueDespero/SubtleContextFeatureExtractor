Isaiah.
Chapter 25.
O YHWH, You are my God, I exalt You, I confess Your Name, || For You have done a wonderful thing, || Counsels of old, steadfastness, O steadfast One. 
For You made of a city a heap, || Of a fortified city a ruin, || A high place of strangers from being a city, || It is not built for all time. 
Therefore a strong people honors You, || A city of the terrible nations fears You. 
For You have been a stronghold for the poor, || A stronghold for the needy in his distress, || A refuge from storm, a shadow from heat, || When the spirit of the terrible is as a storm—a wall. 
As heat in a dry place, || You humble the noise of strangers, || As heat with the shadow of a thick cloud, || The singing of the terrible is humbled. 
And YHWH of Hosts has made, || For all the peoples in this mountain, || A banquet of fat things, || A banquet of preserved things, || Fat things full of marrow, || Preserved things—refined. 
And He has swallowed up in this mountain || The face of the wrapping that is wrapped over all the peoples, || And of the covering that is spread over all the nations. 
He has swallowed up death in victory, || And Lord YHWH has wiped the tear from off all faces, || And He turns aside the reproach of His people from off all the earth, || For YHWH has spoken. 
And one has said in that day, “Behold, this is our God, || We waited for Him, and He saves us, || This is YHWH, we have waited for Him, || We are glad and rejoice in His salvation!” 
For the hand of YHWH rests on this mountain, || And Moab is trodden down under Him, || As straw is trodden down on a dunghill. 
And He spread out His hands in its midst, || As the swimmer spreads out to swim; And He has humbled his excellence || With the machinations of his hands. 
And the fortress of the high place of your walls || He has bowed down—He has made low, || He has caused it to come to the earth—to dust.
