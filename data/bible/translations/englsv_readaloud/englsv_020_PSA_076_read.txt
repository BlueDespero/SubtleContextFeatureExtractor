Psalms.
Chapter 76.
TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM OF ASAPH. A SONG. God is known in Judah, || His Name is great in Israel. 
And His dwelling place is in Salem, || And His habitation in Zion. 
There He has shattered arrows of a bow, || Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah. 
You are bright, majestic above hills of prey. 
The mighty of heart have spoiled themselves, || They have slept their sleep, || And none of the men of might found their hands. 
From Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, || Both rider and horse have been fast asleep. 
You, fearful are You, || And who stands before You, || Since You have been angry? 
You have sounded judgment from the heavens, || Earth has feared, and has been still, 
In the rising of God to judgment, || To save all the humble of earth. Selah. 
For the fierceness of man praises You, || You gird on the remnant of fierceness. 
Vow and complete to your God YHWH, || All you surrounding Him, || They bring presents to the Fearful One. 
He gathers the spirit of leaders, || Fearful to the kings of earth!
