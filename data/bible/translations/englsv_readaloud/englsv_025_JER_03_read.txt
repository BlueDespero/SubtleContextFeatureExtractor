Jeremiah.
Chapter 3.
“Saying, Behold, one sends his wife away, || And she has gone from him, || And she has been to another man, || Does he return to her again? Is that land not greatly defiled? And you have committed whoredom with many lovers, || And turn to Me again,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“Lift your eyes to the high places, and see, || Where have you not been lain with? You have sat for them on the ways, || As an Arab in a wilderness, || And you defile the land, || By your fornications, and by your wickedness. 
And showers are withheld, and there has been no spring rain. You have the forehead of a whorish woman, || You have refused to be ashamed. 
Have you not from now on called to Me, || My Father, You are the leader of my youth? 
Does He keep for all time? Watch forever? Behold, you have spoken these things, || And you do evil, and prevail.” 
And YHWH says to me, in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She is going on every high mountain, and to the place of every green tree, and commits fornication there. 
And I say, after her doing all these, Return to Me, and she has not returned, and her treacherous sister Judah sees it. 
And I see that for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, I have sent her away, and I give the bill of her divorce to her; and her treacherous sister Judah has not feared, and goes and commits fornication—she also. 
And it has come to pass, from the vileness of her fornication, that the land is defiled, and she commits fornication with stone and with wood. 
And even in all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned back to Me with all her heart, but with falsehood,” a declaration of YHWH. 
And YHWH says to me: “Backsliding Israel has justified herself, || More than treacherous Judah. 
Go, and you have proclaimed these words toward the north, and have said, Return, O backsliding Israel,” || A declaration of YHWH! “I do not cause My anger to fall on you, for I am kind,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “I do not watch for all time. 
Only, know your iniquity, || For you have transgressed against your God YHWH, || And you scatter your ways to strangers, || Under every green tree, || And you have not listened to My voice,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
“Return, O backsliding sons,” || A declaration of YHWH. “For I have ruled over you, || And taken you—one from a city, and two from a family, || And have brought you to Zion, 
And I have given shepherds to you || According to My own heart, || And they have fed you with knowledge and understanding. 
And it has come to pass, when you are multiplied, || And have been fruitful in the land, || In those days,” || A declaration of YHWH, || “They no longer say, The Ark of the Covenant of YHWH, || Nor does it go up on the heart, || Nor do they remember concerning it, || Nor do they inspect, nor is it made again. 
At that time they cry to Jerusalem, O throne of YHWH, || And all the nations have been gathered to her, || For the Name of YHWH, to Jerusalem, || Nor do they go after the stubbornness of their evil heart anymore. 
In those days the house of Judah || Goes to the house of Israel, || And they come together from the land of the south, || To the land that I caused your fathers to inherit. 
And I have said, How do I put you among the sons, || And give a desirable land to you, || A beautiful inheritance of the hosts of nations, || And I say, You call Me—My Father, || And you do not turn back from after Me. 
But a woman has deceived her friend, || So you have dealt treacherously with Me, || O house of Israel,” || A declaration of YHWH. 
A voice is heard on high places—weeping, || Supplications of the sons of Israel, || For they have made their way perverse, || They have forgotten their God YHWH. 
“Return, O backsliding sons, || I cause your backslidings to cease.” “Behold us, we have come to You, || For You are our God YHWH. 
Surely in vain—from the heights, || The multitude of mountains—Surely the salvation of Israel is in our God YHWH. 
And the shameful thing has devoured || The labor of our fathers from our youth, || Their flock and their herd, || Their sons and their daughters. 
We have lain down in our shame, and our confusion covers us, || For we have sinned against our God YHWH, || We, and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, || Nor have we listened to the voice of our God YHWH!”
