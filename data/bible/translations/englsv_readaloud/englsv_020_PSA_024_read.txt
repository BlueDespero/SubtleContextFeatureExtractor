Psalms.
Chapter 24.
A PSALM OF DAVID. To YHWH is the earth and its fullness, || The world and the inhabitants in it. 
For He has founded it on the seas, || And He establishes it on the floods. 
Who goes up into the hill of YHWH? And who rises up in His holy place? 
The clean of hands, and pure of heart, || Who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, || Nor has sworn to deceit. 
He carries away a blessing from YHWH, || Righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
This is a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Your face, O Jacob! Selah. 
Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O perpetual doors! And the King of Glory comes in! 
Who is this—“the King of Glory?” YHWH—strong and mighty, || YHWH, the mighty in battle. 
Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O perpetual doors! And the King of Glory comes in! 
Who is He—this “King of Glory?” YHWH of hosts—He is the King of Glory! Selah.
