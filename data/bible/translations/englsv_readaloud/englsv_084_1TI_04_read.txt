1 Timothy.
Chapter 4.
And the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons, 
speaking lies in hypocrisy, being seared in their own conscience, 
forbidding to marry—to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth, 
because every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received, 
for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession. 
Placing these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which you followed after, 
but reject the profane and old women’s fables, and exercise yourself to piety, 
for bodily exercise is to little profit, but piety is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is coming; 
the word is steadfast, and worthy of all acceptance; 
for this we both labor and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Savior of all men—especially of those believing. 
Charge these things, and teach; 
let no one despise your youth, but become a pattern of those believing in word, in behavior, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity; 
until I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching; 
do not be careless of the gift in you, that was given you through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership; 
be careful of these things; be in these things, that your advancement may be evident in all things; 
take heed to yourself and to the teaching; remain in them, for doing this thing, you will save both yourself and those hearing you.
