Proverbs.
Chapter 28.
The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer, || And the righteous is confident as a young lion. 
By the transgression of a land its heads are many, || And by an understanding man, || Who knows right—it is prolonged. 
A man—poor and oppressing the weak, || Is a sweeping rain, and there is no bread. 
Those forsaking the Law praise the wicked, || Those keeping the Law plead against them. 
Evil men do not understand judgment, || And those seeking YHWH understand all. 
Better is the poor walking in his integrity, || Than the perverse of ways who is rich. 
Whoever is keeping the Law is an intelligent son, || And a friend of gluttons || Causes his father to blush. 
Whoever is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, || Gathers it for one favoring the poor. 
Whoever is turning his ear from hearing the Law, || Even his prayer is an abomination. 
Whoever is causing the upright to err in an evil way, || He falls into his own pit, || And the perfect inherits good. 
A rich man is wise in his own eyes, || And the intelligent poor searches him. 
In the exulting of the righteous the glory is abundant, || And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive. 
Whoever is covering his transgressions does not prosper, || And he who is confessing and forsaking has mercy. 
O the blessedness of a man fearing continually, || And whoever is hardening his heart falls into evil. 
A growling lion, and a ranging bear, || Is the wicked ruler over a poor people. 
A leader lacking understanding multiplies oppressions, || Whoever is hating dishonest gain prolongs days. 
A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, || Flees to the pit, and none takes hold on him to help. 
Whoever is walking uprightly is saved, || And the perverted of ways falls at once. 
Whoever is tilling his ground is satisfied with bread, || And whoever is pursuing vanity, || Is filled with poverty. 
A steadfast man has multiplied blessings, || And whoever is hastening to be rich is not acquitted. 
It is not good to discern faces, || And a man transgresses for a piece of bread. 
The man with an evil eye is troubled for wealth, || And he does not know that want meets him. 
Whoever is reproving a man finds grace afterward, || More than a flatterer with the tongue. 
Whoever is robbing his father or his mother, || And is saying, “It is not transgression,” || He is a companion to a destroyer. 
Whoever is proud in soul stirs up contention, || And whoever is trusting on YHWH is made fat. 
Whoever is trusting in his heart is a fool, || And whoever is walking in wisdom is delivered. 
Whoever is giving to the poor has no lack, || And whoever is hiding his eyes multiplied curses. 
A man is hidden in the rising of the wicked, || And the righteous multiply in their destruction!
