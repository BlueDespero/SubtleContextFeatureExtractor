Revelation.
Chapter 8.
And when He opens the seventh seal, there came silence in Heaven about half an hour, 
and I saw the seven messengers who have stood before God, and there were given to them seven trumpets, 
and another messenger came, and he stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given to him much incense, that he may give it to the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that is before the throne, 
and the smoke of the incenses, with the prayers of the holy ones, went up before God out of the hand of the messenger; 
and the messenger took the censer, and filled it out of the fire of the altar, and cast it to the earth, and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 
And the seven messengers who are having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they may sound the trumpets; 
and the first messenger sounded the trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth, and the third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 
And the second messenger sounded the trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third of the sea became blood, 
and the third of the creatures that are in the sea died, those having life, and the third of the ships were destroyed. 
And the third messenger sounded the trumpet, and there fell out of the sky a great star, burning as a lamp, and it fell on the third of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters, 
and the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third of the waters become wormwood, and many of the men died because of the waters, because they were made bitter. 
And the fourth messenger sounded the trumpet, and the third of the sun was struck, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, that the third of them may be darkened, and that the day may not shine—the third of it, and the night in like manner. 
And I saw, and I heard one messenger, flying in midair, saying with a great voice, “Woe, woe, woe, to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers being about to sound trumpets.”
