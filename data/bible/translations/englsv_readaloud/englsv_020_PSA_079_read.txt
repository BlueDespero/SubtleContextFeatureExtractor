Psalms.
Chapter 79.
A PSALM OF ASAPH. O God, nations have come into Your inheritance, || They have defiled Your holy temple, || They made Jerusalem become heaps, 
They gave the dead bodies of Your servants || As food for the birds of the heavens, || The flesh of Your saints || For the wild beast of the earth. 
They have shed their blood || As water around Jerusalem, || And there is none burying. 
We have been a reproach to our neighbors, || A scorn and a derision to our surrounders. 
Until when, O YHWH? Are You angry forever? Your jealousy burns as fire. 
Pour Your fury on the nations who have not known You, || And on kingdoms that have not called on Your Name. 
For one has devoured Jacob, || And they have made his habitation desolate. 
Do not remember for us the iniquities of forefathers, || Hurry, let Your mercies go before us, || For we have been very weak. 
Help us, O God of our salvation, || Because of the glory of Your Name, || And deliver us, and cover over our sins, || For Your Name’s sake. 
Why do the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations before our eyes, || The vengeance of the blood of Your servants that is shed. 
Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before You, || According to the greatness of Your arm, || Leave the sons of death. 
And return to our neighbors, || Sevenfold to their bosom, their reproach, || With which they reproached You, O Lord. 
And we, Your people, and the flock of Your pasture, || We give thanks to You for all time, || We recount Your praise from generation to generation!
