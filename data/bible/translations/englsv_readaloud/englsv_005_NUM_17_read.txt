Numbers.
Chapter 17.
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel, and take a rod from each of them, for a father’s house, from all their princes, for the house of their fathers—twelve rods; you write the name of each on his rod, 
and you write Aaron’s name on the tribe of Levi; for one rod is for the head of their fathers’ house. 
And you have placed them in the Tent of Meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you. 
And it has come to pass, the man’s rod on whom I fix flourishes, and I have caused the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against you, to cease from off Me.” 
And Moses speaks to the sons of Israel, and all their princes give to him one rod for a prince, one rod for a prince, for their fathers’ house—twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron is in the midst of their rods; 
and Moses places the rods before YHWH in the Tent of the Testimony. 
And it comes to pass, on the next day, that Moses goes into the Tent of the Testimony, and behold, the rod of Aaron has flourished for the house of Levi, and brings out a bud, and blossoms with a blossom, and produces almonds; 
and Moses brings out all the rods from before YHWH to all the sons of Israel, and they look, and each takes his rod. 
And YHWH says to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the Testimony, for a charge, for a sign to the sons of rebellion, and you remove their murmurings from off Me, and they do not die”; 
and Moses does as YHWH has commanded him; so he has done. 
And the sons of Israel speak to Moses, saying, “Behold, we have expired, we have perished, all of us have perished! 
Any who is at all drawing near to the Dwelling Place of YHWH dies; have we not been consumed—to expire?”
