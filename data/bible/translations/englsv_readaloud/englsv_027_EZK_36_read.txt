Ezekiel.
Chapter 36.
“And you, son of man, prophesy to mountains of Israel, and you have said, O mountains of Israel, hear a word of YHWH! 
Thus said Lord YHWH: Because the enemy said against you, Aha! The high places of old have also become our possession, 
therefore, prophesy, and you have said, Thus said Lord YHWH: Because, even because, of desolating, || And of swallowing you up from all around, || For your being a possession to the remnant of the nations, || And you are taken up on the tip of the tongue, || And are an evil report to the people. 
Therefore, O mountains of Israel, || Hear a word of Lord YHWH! Thus said Lord YHWH, to mountains, and to hills, || To streams, and to valleys, || And to ruins that are desolate, || And to cities that are forsaken, || That have been for a prey, || And for a scorn, to the remnant of the surrounding nations, 
Therefore, thus said Lord YHWH: Have I not, in the fire of My jealousy, || Spoken against the remnant of the nations, || And against Edom—all of it, || Who gave My land to themselves for a possession, || With the joy of the whole heart—with despite of soul, || For the sake of casting it out for a prey? 
Therefore, prophesy concerning the ground of Israel, || And you have said to mountains, and to hills, || To streams, and to valleys, || Thus said Lord YHWH: Behold, I, in My jealousy and in My fury, have spoken, || Because you have borne the shame of nations. 
Therefore, thus said Lord YHWH: I have lifted up My hand, || Do the nations who are surrounding you not bear their own shame? 
And you, O mountains of Israel, || You give out your branch, || And you bear your fruits for My people Israel, || For they have drawn near to come. 
For behold, I am for you, and have turned to you, || And you have been tilled and sown. 
And I have multiplied men on you, || All the house of Israel—all of it, || And the cities have been inhabited, || And the ruins are built. 
And I have multiplied man and beast on you, || And they have multiplied and been fruitful, || And I have caused you to dwell according to your former states, || And I have done better than at your beginnings, || And you have known that I am YHWH. 
And I have caused man to walk over you—My people Israel, || And they possess you, and you have been their inheritance, || And you no longer add to bereave them. 
Thus said Lord YHWH: Because they are saying to you, You are a devourer of men, || And you have been a bereaver of your nations, 
Therefore, you no longer devour man, || And you do not cause your nations to stumble anymore, || A declaration of Lord YHWH. 
And I do not proclaim the shame of the nations to you anymore, || And you no longer bear the reproach of peoples, || And your nations do not stumble anymore, || A declaration of Lord YHWH.” 
And there is a word of YHWH to me, saying, 
“Son of man, || The house of Israel are dwelling on their land, || And they defile it by their way and by their doings, || Their way has been as the uncleanness of a separated one before Me. 
And I pour out My fury on them || For the blood that they shed on the land, || And they have defiled it with their idols. 
And I scatter them among nations, || And they are spread through lands, || According to their way, and according to their doings, || I have judged them. 
And one goes to the nations to where they have gone, || And they defile My holy Name by saying to them, || These are the people of YHWH, || And they have gone forth from His land. 
And I have pity on My holy Name, || That the house of Israel has defiled || Among the nations to where they have gone in. 
Therefore, say to the house of Israel, Thus said Lord YHWH: I am not working for your sake, || O house of Israel, but for My holy Name || That you have defiled || Among the nations to where you have gone in. 
And I have sanctified My great Name, || That is profaned among the nations, || That you have defiled in your midst, || And the nations have known that I am YHWH, || A declaration of Lord YHWH, || In My being sanctified in you before your eyes. 
And I have taken you out of the nations, || And have gathered you out of all the lands, || And I have brought you into your land, 
And I have sprinkled clean water over you, || And you have been clean; I cleanse you from all your uncleannesses, || And from all your idols. 
And I have given a new heart to you, || And I give a new spirit in your midst, || And I have turned aside the heart of stone out of your flesh, || And I have given a heart of flesh to you. 
And I give My Spirit in your midst, || And I have done this, so that you walk in My statutes, || And you keep My judgments, and have done them. 
And you have dwelt in the land that I have given to your fathers, || And you have been to Me for a people, || And I am to you for God. 
And I have saved you from all your uncleannesses, || And I have called to the grain, and multiplied it, || And I have put no famine on you. 
And I have multiplied the fruit of the tree, || And the increase of the field, || So that you do not receive a reproach of famine among nations anymore. 
And you have remembered your ways that are evil, || And your doings that are not good, || And have been loathsome in your own faces, || For your iniquities, and for your abominations. 
I am not working for your sake, || A declaration of Lord YHWH, || Be it known to you, || Be ashamed and confounded, because of your ways, || O house of Israel. 
Thus said Lord YHWH: In the day of My cleansing you from all your iniquities, || I have caused the cities to be inhabited, || And the ruins have been built, 
And the desolate land is tilled, || Instead of which it was a desolation before the eyes of everyone passing by, 
And they have said: This land, that was desolated, || Has been as the Garden of Eden, || And the cities—the dried up, || And the desolated, and the broken down, || And the fortified have remained. 
And the nations who are left around you have known || That I, YHWH, have built the thrown down, || I have planted the desolated: I, YHWH, have spoken, and I have done it. 
Thus said Lord YHWH: Yet this I am inquired of by the house of Israel to do for them: I multiply them as a flock of men, 
As a flock of holy ones, as a flock of Jerusalem, || In her appointed times, || So the dried up cities are full of flocks of man, || And they have known that I am YHWH!”
