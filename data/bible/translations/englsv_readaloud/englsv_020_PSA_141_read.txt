Psalms.
Chapter 141.
A PSALM OF DAVID. O YHWH, I have called You, hurry to me, || Give ear to my voice when I call to You. 
My prayer is prepared—incense before You, || The lifting up of my hands—the evening present. 
Set, O YHWH, a watch for my mouth, || Watch over the door of my lips. 
Do not incline my heart to an evil thing, || To habitually do actions in wickedness, || Working iniquity with men, || Indeed, I do not eat of their pleasant things. 
The righteous beat me in kindness. And reprove me, || My head does not disallow oil of the head, || For my prayer is still about their distress. 
Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, || And they have heard my sayings, || For they have been pleasant. 
As one tilling and ripping up in the land, || Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul. 
But to You, O YHWH, my Lord, are my eyes, || In You I have trusted, || Do not make my soul bare. 
Keep me from the trap they laid for me, || Even snares of workers of iniquity. 
The wicked fall in their dragnets together, until I pass over!
