Proverbs.
Chapter 10.
Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causes a father to rejoice, || And a foolish son is an affliction to his mother. 
Treasures of wickedness do not profit, || And righteousness delivers from death. 
YHWH does not cause the soul of the righteous to hunger, || And He thrusts away the desire of the wicked. 
Poor is he who is working with a slothful hand, || And the hand of the diligent makes rich. 
Whoever is gathering in summer is a wise son, || Whoever is sleeping in harvest is a son causing shame. 
Blessings are for the head of the righteous, || And the mouth of the wicked covers violence. 
The remembrance of the righteous is for a blessing, || And the name of the wicked rots. 
The wise in heart accepts commands, || And a talkative fool kicks. 
Whoever is walking in integrity walks confidently, || And whoever is perverting his ways is known. 
Whoever is winking the eye gives grief, || And a talkative fool kicks. 
A fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous, || And the mouth of the wicked covers violence. 
Hatred awakens contentions, || And love covers over all transgressions. 
Wisdom is found in the lips of the intelligent, || And a rod is for the back of him who is lacking understanding. 
The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool is near ruin. 
The wealth of the rich is his strong city, || The ruin of the poor is their poverty. 
The wage of the righteous is for life, || The increase of the wicked for sin. 
A traveler to life is he who is keeping instruction, || And whoever is forsaking rebuke is erring. 
Whoever is covering hatred with lying lips, || And whoever is bringing out an evil report is a fool. 
In the abundance of words transgression does not cease, || And whoever is restraining his lips is wise. 
The tongue of the righteous is chosen silver, || The heart of the wicked—as a little thing. 
The lips of the righteous delight many, || And fools die for lack of heart. 
The blessing of YHWH—it makes rich, || And He adds no grief with it. 
To execute inventions is as play to a fool, || And wisdom to a man of understanding. 
The feared thing of the wicked meets him, || And the desire of the righteous is given. 
As the passing by of a windstorm, || So the wicked is not, || And the righteous is a perpetual foundation. 
As vinegar to the teeth, || And as smoke to the eyes, || So is the slothful to those sending him. 
The fear of YHWH adds days, || And the years of the wicked are shortened. 
The hope of the righteous is joyful, || And the expectation of the wicked perishes. 
The way of YHWH is strength to the perfect, || And ruin to workers of iniquity. 
The righteous is not moved for all time, || And the wicked do not inhabit the earth. 
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, || And the tongue of contrariness is cut out. 
The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, || And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!
