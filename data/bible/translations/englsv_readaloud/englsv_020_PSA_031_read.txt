Chapter 31.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. In You, O YHWH, I have trusted, || Do not let me be ashamed for all time, || In Your righteousness deliver me. 
Incline Your ear to me quickly, deliver me, || Be to me for a strong rock, || For a house of bulwarks to save me. 
For You are my rock and my bulwark, || For Your Name’s sake lead me and tend me. 
Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, || For You are my strength. 
Into Your hand I commit my spirit, || You have redeemed me, YHWH God of truth. 
I have hated the observers of lying vanities, || And I have been confident toward YHWH. 
I rejoice, and am glad in Your kindness, || In that You have seen my affliction, || You have known my soul in adversities. 
And You have not shut me up, || Into the hand of an enemy, || You have caused my feet to stand in a broad place. 
Favor me, O YHWH, for distress is to me, || My eye, my soul, and my body || Have become old by provocation. 
For my life has been consumed in sorrow || And my years in sighing. My strength has been feeble because of my iniquity, || And my bones have become old. 
I have been a reproach among all my adversaries, || And to my neighbors exceedingly, || And a fear to my acquaintances, || Those seeing me without—fled from me. 
I have been forgotten as dead, out of mind, || I have been as a perishing vessel. 
For I have heard an evil account of many, || Fear is all around. In their being united against me, || They have devised to take my life, 
And I have trusted on You, || O YHWH, I have said, “You are my God.” 
In Your hand are my times, || Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, || And from my pursuers. 
Cause Your face to shine on Your servant, || Save me in Your kindness. 
O YHWH, do not let me be ashamed, || For I have called You, let the wicked be ashamed, || Let them become silent to Sheol. 
Let lips of falsehood become mute, || That are speaking against the righteous, || Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt. 
How abundant is Your goodness, || That You have laid up for those fearing You, || You have worked for those trusting in You, || Before sons of men. 
You hide them in the secret place of Your presence, || From schemes of man, || You conceal them in a dwelling place, || From the strife of tongues. 
Blessed is YHWH, || For He has made His kindness marvelous || To me in a city of bulwarks. 
And I have said in my haste, “I have been cut off from before Your eyes,” || But You have heard the voice of my supplications, || In my crying to You. 
Love YHWH, all you His saints, || YHWH is keeping the faithful, || And repaying a proud doer abundantly. 
Be strong, and He strengthens your heart, || All you who are waiting for YHWH!
