Proverbs.
Chapter 22.
A name is chosen rather than much wealth, || Than silver and than gold—good grace. 
Rich and poor have met together, || YHWH is the Maker of them all. 
The prudent has seen the evil, and is hidden, || And the simple have passed on, and are punished. 
The end of humility is the fear of YHWH, riches, and honor, and life. 
Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse, || Whoever is keeping his soul is far from them. 
Give instruction to a youth about his way, || Even when he is old he does not turn from it. 
The rich rules over the poor, || And a servant is the borrower to the lender. 
Whoever is sowing perverseness reaps sorrow, || And the rod of his anger wears out. 
The good of eye—he is blessed, || For he has given of his bread to the poor. 
Cast out a scorner—and contention goes out, || And strife and shame cease. 
Whoever is loving cleanness of heart, || His lips are grace, || A king is his friend. 
The eyes of YHWH have kept knowledge, || And He overthrows the words of the treacherous. 
The slothful has said, “A lion is outside, || I am slain in the midst of the broad places.” 
The mouth of strange women is a deep pit, || The abhorred of YHWH falls there. 
Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth, || The rod of discipline puts it far from him. 
He who is oppressing the poor to multiply his riches, || Is giving to the rich—only to want. 
Incline your ear, and hear words of the wise, || And set your heart to my knowledge, 
For they are pleasant when you keep them in your heart, || They are prepared together for your lips. 
That your trust may be in YHWH, || I caused you to know today, even you. 
Have I not written to you three times || With counsels and knowledge? 
To cause you to know the certainty of sayings of truth, || To return sayings of truth to those sending you. 
Do not rob the poor because he is poor, || And do not bruise the afflicted in the gate. 
For YHWH pleads their cause, || And has spoiled the soul of their spoilers. 
Do not show yourself friendly with an angry man, || And do not go in with a man of fury, 
Lest you learn his paths, || And have received a snare to your soul. 
Do not be among those striking hands, || Among sureties for burdens. 
If you have nothing to pay, || Why does he take your bed from under you? 
Do not remove a border of ancient times, || That your fathers have made. 
Have you seen a man speedy in his business? He stations himself before kings, || He does not station himself before obscure men!
