Numbers.
Chapter 24.
And Balaam sees that it is good in the eyes of YHWH to bless Israel, and he has not gone as time by time to seek enchantments, and he sets his face toward the wilderness; 
and Balaam lifts up his eyes, and sees Israel dwelling by its tribes, and the Spirit of God is on him, 
and he takes up his allegory and says: “An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor, || And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut, 
An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God, || Who sees a vision of the Almighty, || Falling—and eyes uncovered: 
How good have been your tents, O Jacob, || Your dwelling places, O Israel; 
They have been stretched out as valleys, || As gardens by a river; As aloes YHWH has planted, || As cedars by waters; 
He makes water flow from his buckets, || And his seed is in many waters; And his King is higher than Gog or Agag, || And his kingdom is exalted. 
God is bringing him out of Egypt, || As the swiftness of a wild ox for him, || He eats up nations—his adversaries, || And he breaks their bones, || And he strikes with his arrows. 
He has bent, he has lain down as a lion, || And as a lioness, who raises him up? He who is blessing you is blessed, || And he who is cursing you is cursed.” 
And the anger of Balak burns against Balaam, and he strikes his hands; and Balak says to Balaam, “I called you to pierce my enemies, and behold, you have certainly blessed these three times; 
and now, flee for yourself to your place; I have said, I greatly honor you, and behold, YHWH has kept you back from honor.” 
And Balaam says to Balak, “Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you have sent to me, saying, 
If Balak gives to me the fullness of his house of silver and gold, I am not able to pass over the command of YHWH, to do good or evil of my own heart; that which YHWH speaks—it I speak? 
And now, behold, I am going to my people; come, I counsel you concerning that which this people does to your people in the latter end of the days.” 
And he takes up his allegory and says: “An affirmation of Balaam son of Beor, || And an affirmation of the man whose eyes are shut; 
An affirmation of him who is hearing sayings of God, || And knowing knowledge of the Most High; He sees a vision of the Almighty, || Falling—and eyes uncovered: 
I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; A star has proceeded from Jacob, || And a scepter has risen from Israel, || And has struck corners of Moab, || And has destroyed all sons of Seth. 
And Edom has been a possession, || And Seir has been a possession for his enemies, || And Israel is doing valiantly; 
And One rules out of Jacob, || And has destroyed a remnant from the city.” 
And he sees Amalek, and takes up his allegory, and says: “Amalek is first among nations, || But his latter end—destruction forever.” 
And he sees the Kenite, and takes up his allegory, and says: “Your dwelling is enduring, || And your nest is being set in a rock, 
But the Kenite is for a burning; Until when does Asshur keep you captive?” 
And he takes up his allegory and says: “Woe! Who lives when God does this? 
But ships come from the side of Chittim, || And they have humbled Asshur, || And they have humbled Eber, || But it is also perishing forever.” 
And Balaam rises, and goes, and turns back to his place, and Balak has also gone on his way.
