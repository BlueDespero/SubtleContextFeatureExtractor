Psalms.
Chapter 88.
A SONG. A PSALM OF THE SONS OF KORAH. TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “SICKNESS TO AFFLICT.” AN INSTRUCTION OF HEMAN THE EZRAHITE. O YHWH, God of my salvation, || Daily I have cried, nightly before You, 
My prayer comes in before You, || Incline Your ear to my loud cry, 
For my soul has been full of evils, || And my life has come to Sheol. 
I have been reckoned with those going down to the pit, || I have been as a man without strength. 
Among the dead—free, || As pierced ones lying in the grave, || Whom You have not remembered anymore, || Indeed, they have been cut off by Your hand. 
You have put me in the lowest pit, || In dark places, in depths. 
Your fury has lain on me, || And You have afflicted with all Your breakers. Selah. 
You have put my acquaintance far from me, || You have made me an abomination to them, || Shut up—I do not go forth. 
My eye has grieved because of affliction, || I called You, O YHWH, all the day, || I have spread out my hands to You. 
Do You do wonders to the dead? Does Rephaim rise? Do they thank You? Selah. 
Is Your kindness recounted in the grave? Your faithfulness in destruction? 
Are Your wonders known in the darkness? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
And I, to You, O YHWH, I have cried, || And in the morning my prayer comes before You. 
Why, O YHWH, do You cast off my soul? You hide Your face from me. 
I am afflicted, and expiring from youth, || I have borne Your terrors—I pine away. 
Your wrath has passed over me, || Your terrors have cut me off, 
They have surrounded me as waters all the day, || They have gone around against me together, 
You have put lover and friend far from me, || My acquaintance is the place of darkness!
