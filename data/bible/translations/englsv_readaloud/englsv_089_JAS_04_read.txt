James.
Chapter 4.
From where are wars and fightings among you? Is it not from here, out of your passions warring in your members? 
You desire, and do not have, so you murder; and you are zealous, and are not able to attain, so you fight and war; and you do not have, because of your not asking; 
you ask, and you do not receive, because you ask badly, that you may spend it in your pleasures. 
Adulterers and adulteresses! Have you not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever, then, may intend to be a friend of the world, he is designated as an enemy of God. 
Or, do you think that the Writing says emptily, “The Spirit that has dwelt in us yearns with envy,” 
but God gives greater grace, for this reason it says, “God sets Himself up against proud ones, and He gives grace to lowly ones.” 
Be subject, then, to God; stand up against the Devil, and he will flee from you; 
draw near to God, and He will draw near to you; cleanse hands, you sinners! And purify hearts, you split-souled! 
Be exceedingly afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter be turned to mourning, and the joy to heaviness; 
be made low before the LORD, and He will exalt you. 
Do not speak against one another, brothers; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, speaks against law, and judges law, and if you judge law, you are not a doer of law but a judge. 
One is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; you—who are you that judges the other? 
Go, now, you who are saying, “Today and tomorrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain,” 
who does not know the thing of tomorrow; for what is your life? For it is a vapor that is appearing for a little while, and then is vanishing; 
instead, you ought to say, “If the LORD may will, we will live, and do this or that”; 
but now you glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil; 
to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing it, it is sin to him.
