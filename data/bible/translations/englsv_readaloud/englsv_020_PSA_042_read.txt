Psalms.
Chapter 42.
TO THE OVERSEER. AN INSTRUCTION OF THE SONS OF KORAH. As a deer pants for streams of water, || So my soul pants toward You, O God. 
My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, || When do I enter and see the face of God? 
My tear has been bread day and night to me, || In their saying to me all the day, “Where is your God?” 
These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, || For I pass over into the shelter, || I go softly with them to the house of God, || With the voice of singing and confession, || The multitude keeping celebration! 
Why bow yourself, O my soul? Indeed, are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for I still confess Him: The salvation of my countenance—my God! 
My soul bows itself in me, || Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan, || And of the Hermons, from Mount Mizar. 
Deep is calling to deep || At the noise of Your waterspouts, || All Your breakers and Your billows passed over me. 
By day YHWH commands His kindness, || And by night a song is with me, || A prayer to the God of my life. 
I say to God my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning in the oppression of an enemy?” 
With a sword in my bones || My adversaries have reproached me, || In their saying to me all the day, “Where is your God?” 
Why bow yourself, O my soul? And why are you troubled within me? Wait for God, for I still confess Him, || The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
