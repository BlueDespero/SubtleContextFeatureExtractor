Proverbs.
Chapter 3.
My son! Do not forget my law, || And let your heart keep my commands, 
For the length of your days and years, || Life and peace they add to you. 
Do not let kindness and truth forsake you, || Bind them on your neck, || Write them on the tablet of your heart, 
And find grace and good understanding || In the eyes of God and man. 
Trust to YHWH with all your heart, || And do not lean to your own understanding. 
In all your ways know Him, || And He makes your paths straight. 
Do not be wise in your own eyes, || Fear YHWH, and turn aside from evil. 
It is healing to your navel, || And moistening to your bones. 
Honor YHWH from your substance, || And from the beginning of all your increase; 
And your barns are filled with plenty, || And your presses break forth with new wine. 
Discipline of YHWH, my son, do not despise, || And do not be distressed with His reproof, 
For whom YHWH loves He reproves, || Even as a father the son He is pleased with. 
O the blessedness of a man who has found wisdom, || And of a man who brings forth understanding. 
For better is her merchandise || Than the merchandise of silver, || And than gold—her increase. 
She is precious above rubies, || And all your pleasures are not comparable to her. 
Length of days is in her right hand, || In her left are wealth and honor. 
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, || And all her paths are peace. 
She is a tree of life to those laying hold on her, || And whoever is retaining her is blessed. 
YHWH founded the earth by wisdom, || He prepared the heavens by understanding. 
By His knowledge depths have been broken, || And clouds drop dew. 
My son! Do not let them turn from your eyes, || Keep wisdom and thoughtfulness, 
And they are life to your soul, and grace to your neck. 
Then you go your way confidently, || And your foot does not stumble. 
If you lie down, you are not afraid, || Indeed, you have lain down, || And your sleep has been sweet. 
Do not be afraid of sudden fear, || And of the desolation of the wicked when it comes. 
For YHWH is at your side, || And He has kept your foot from capture. 
Do not withhold good from its owners, || When your hand is toward God to do it. 
Do not say to your friend, || “Go, and return, and tomorrow I give,” || When substance is with you. 
Do not devise evil against your neighbor, || And he sitting confidently with you. 
Do not strive with a man without cause, || If he has not done you evil. 
Do not be envious of a man of violence, || Nor fix on any of his ways. 
For the perverted is an abomination to YHWH, || And His secret counsel is with the upright. 
The curse of YHWH is in the house of the wicked. And He blesses the habitation of the righteous. 
If He scorns the scorners, || Yet He gives grace to the humble. 
The wise inherit glory, || And fools are bearing away shame!
