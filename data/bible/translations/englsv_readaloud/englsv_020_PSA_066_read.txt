Psalms.
Chapter 66.
TO THE OVERSEER. A SONG. A PSALM. Shout to God, all the earth. 
Praise the glory of His Name, || Make honorable His praise. 
Say to God, “How fearful Your works—By the abundance of Your strength, || Your enemies feign obedience to You. 
All the earth bows to You, || They sing praise to You, they praise Your Name.” Selah. 
Come, and see the works of God, || Fearful acts toward the sons of men. 
He has turned a sea to dry land, || Through a river they pass over on foot, || There we rejoice in Him. 
Ruling by His might for all time, || His eyes watch among the nations, || The stubborn do not exalt themselves. Selah. 
Bless our God you peoples, || And sound the voice of His praise, 
Who has placed our soul in life, || And has not permitted our feet to be moved. 
For You have tried us, O God, || You have refined us as the refining of silver. 
You have brought us into a net, || You have placed pressure on our loins. 
You have caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, || And You bring us out to a watered place. 
I enter Your house with burnt-offerings, || I complete my vows to You, 
For my lips were opened, || And my mouth spoke in my distress: 
“I offer to You burnt-offerings of fatlings, || With incense of rams, I prepare a bullock with male goats.” Selah. 
Come, hear, all you who fear God, || And I recount what He did for my soul. 
I have called to Him with my mouth, || And exaltation is under my tongue. 
Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, || The Lord does not hear. 
But God has heard, || He has attended to the voice of my prayer. 
Blessed is God, || Who has not turned aside my prayer, || And His loving-kindness, from me!
