1 Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
If I speak with the tongues of men and of messengers, and do not have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal; 
and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and do not have love, I am nothing; 
and if I give away all my goods to feed others, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and do not have love, I am profited nothing. 
Love is long-suffering, it is kind, love does not envy, love does not vaunt itself, is not puffed up, 
does not act unseemly, does not seek its own things, is not provoked, does not impute evil, 
does not rejoice over unrighteousness, and rejoices with the truth; 
it bears all things, it believes all, it hopes all, it endures all. 
Love never fails; and whether there be prophecies, they will become useless; whether tongues, they will cease; whether knowledge, it will become useless; 
for we know in part, and we prophesy in part; 
and when that which is perfect may come, then that which is in part will become useless. 
When I was a child, I was speaking as a child, I was thinking as a child, I was reasoning as a child, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the child; 
for we now see obscurely through a mirror, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I will fully know, as I was also known; 
and now there remains faith, hope, love—these three; and the greatest of these is love.
