Hebrews.
Chapter 2.
Because of this it is more abundantly necessary to take heed to the things heard, lest we may drift away, 
for if the word being spoken through messengers became steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just repayment, 
how will we escape, having neglected such great salvation? Which having received that spoken through the LORD from the beginning, was confirmed to us by those having heard, 
God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will. 
For He did not subject the coming world to messengers, concerning which we speak, 
and one in a certain place testified fully, saying, “What is man, that You are mindful of him, || Or a son of man, that You look after him? 
You made him a little less than messengers, || You crowned him with glory and honor, || And set him over the works of Your hands, 
You put all things in subjection under his feet,” for in the subjecting to Him all things, He left nothing to Him unsubjected, but now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him, 
and we see Him who was made a little less than messengers—Jesus—because of the suffering of death, having been crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God He might taste of death for everyone. 
For it was fitting to Him, because of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings, 
for both He who is sanctifying and those sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, 
saying, “I will declare Your Name to My brothers, || In the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to You”; and again, “I will be trusting on Him”; 
and again, “Behold, I and the children that God gave to Me.” 
Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself also took part of the same in like manner, that through death He might destroy him having the power of death—that is, the Devil— 
and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage, 
for doubtless, He does not lay hold of messengers, but He lays hold of the seed of Abraham, 
for this reason it seemed necessary to Him to be made like the brothers in all things, that He might become a kind and faithful Chief Priest in the things related to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people, 
for in that He suffered, Himself being tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted.
