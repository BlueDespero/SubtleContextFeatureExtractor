Psalms.
Chapter 143.
A PSALM OF DAVID. O YHWH, hear my prayer, || Give ear to my supplications, || Answer me in Your faithfulness—in Your righteousness. 
And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, || For no one living is justified before You. 
For an enemy has pursued my soul, || He has bruised my life to the earth, || He has caused me to dwell in dark places, || As the dead of old. 
And my spirit has become feeble in me, || My heart has become desolate within me. 
I have remembered days of old, || I have meditated on all Your acts, || I muse on the work of Your hand. 
I have spread forth my hands to You, || My soul is as a weary land for You. Selah. 
Hurry, answer me, O YHWH, || My spirit has been consumed, || Do not hide Your face from me, || Or I have been compared with those going down to the pit. 
Cause me to hear Your kindness in the morning, || For I have trusted in You, || Cause me to know the way that I go, || For I have lifted up my soul to You. 
Deliver me from my enemies, O YHWH, || Near You I am covered. 
Teach me to do Your good pleasure, || For You are my God—Your Spirit is good, || Lead me into a land of uprightness. 
You quicken me for Your Name’s sake, O YHWH, || In Your righteousness, You bring out my soul from distress, 
And in Your kindness cut off my enemies, || And have destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, || For I am Your servant!
