Isaiah.
Chapter 62.
For Zion’s sake I am not silent, || And for Jerusalem’s sake I do not rest, || Until her righteousness goes out as brightness, || And her salvation burns as a torch. 
And nations have seen your righteousness, || And all kings your glory, || And He is giving a new name to you, || That the mouth of YHWH defines. 
And you have been a crown of beauty in the hand of YHWH, || And a turban of royalty in the hand of your God, 
It is not said of you anymore, “Forsaken!” And of your land it is not said anymore, “Desolate,” || For to you is cried, “My delight is in her,” || And to your land, “Married,” || For YHWH has delighted in you, || And your land is married. 
For a young man marries a virgin, || Your builders marry you, || With the joy of a bridegroom over a bride, || Your God rejoices over you. 
“On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen, || All the day and all the night, || Continually, they are not silent.” O you remembering YHWH, do not keep silence for yourselves, 
And do not give silence to Him, || Until He establishes, and until He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
YHWH has sworn by His right hand, || Even by the arm of His strength: “I do not give your grain anymore as food for your enemies, || Nor do sons of a stranger drink your new wine, || For which you have labored. 
For those gathering it eat it, and have praised YHWH, || And those collecting it drink it in My holy courts.” 
Pass on, pass on through the gates, || Prepare the way of the people, || Raise up, raise up the highway, clear it from stones, || Lift up an ensign over the peoples. 
Behold, YHWH has proclaimed to the end of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Zion, || Behold, your salvation has come, || Behold, His hire is with Him, || And His wage before Him.” 
And they have cried to them, “The People of the Holy One! The Redeemed of YHWH!” Indeed, to you is called, “The sought out one, a city not forsaken!”
