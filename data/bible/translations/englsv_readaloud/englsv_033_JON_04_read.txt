Jonah.
Chapter 4.
And it is grievous to Jonah—a great evil—and he is displeased at it; 
and he prays to YHWH, and he says, “Ah, now, O YHWH, is this not my word while I was in my own land—therefore I was beforehand going to flee to Tarshish—that I have known that You are a God, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in kindness, and relenting of evil? 
And now, O YHWH, please take my soul from me, for better is my death than my life.” 
And YHWH says, “Is doing good displeasing to you?” 
And Jonah goes forth from the city, and sits on the east of the city, and makes a shelter for himself there, and sits under it in the shade, until he sees what is in the city. 
And YHWH God appoints a gourd, and causes it to come up over Jonah, to be a shade over his head, to give deliverance to him from his affliction, and Jonah rejoices because of the gourd with great joy. 
And God appoints a worm at the going up of the dawn on the next day, and it strikes the gourd, and it dries up. 
And it comes to pass, about the rising of the sun, that God appoints a cutting east wind, and the sun strikes on the head of Jonah, and he wraps himself up, and asks for his soul to die, and says, “Better is my death than my life.” 
And God says to Jonah: “Is doing good displeasing to you, because of the gourd?” And he says, “To do good is displeasing to me—to death.” 
And YHWH says, “You have had pity on the gourd, for which you did not labor, neither did you nourish it, which came up as a son of night, and perished as a son of night, 
and I—do I not have pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than one hundred twenty thousand of mankind, who have not known between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?”
