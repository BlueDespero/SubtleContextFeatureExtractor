Psalms.
Chapter 56.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “A SILENT DOVE FAR OFF.” A MIKTAM OF DAVID, IN THE PHILISTINES’ TAKING HOLD OF HIM IN GATH. Favor me, O God, for man swallowed me up, || All the day fighting he oppresses me, 
My enemies have swallowed up all the day, || For many are fighting against me, O Most High, 
In the day I am afraid I am confident toward You. 
In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, || I do not fear what flesh does to me. 
All the day they wrest my words, || All their thoughts are for evil concerning me, 
They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, || When they have expected my soul. 
They escape by iniquity, || In anger put down the peoples, O God. 
You have counted my wandering, || You place my tear in Your bottle, || Are they not in Your scroll? 
Then turn back my enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God is for me. 
In God I praise the word, || In YHWH I praise the word. 
In God I trusted, || I do not fear what man does to me, 
On me, O God, are Your vows, || I repay thank-offerings to You. 
For You have delivered my soul from death, || Do You not keep my feet from falling? To habitually walk before God in the light of the living!
