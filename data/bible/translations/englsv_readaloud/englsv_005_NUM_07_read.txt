Numbers.
Chapter 7.
And it comes to pass on the day when Moses was finishing to set up the Dwelling Place, that he anoints it, and sanctifies it, and all its vessels, and the altar, and all its vessels, and he anoints them, and sanctifies them, 
and the princes of Israel (heads of the house of their fathers, they are princes of the tribes, they who are standing over those numbered) bring near, 
indeed, they bring their offering before YHWH of six covered wagons and twelve oxen—a wagon for two of the princes, and an ox for one—and they bring them near before the Dwelling Place. 
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Receive these from them, and they have been used for doing the service of the Tent of Meeting, and you have given them to the Levites, each according to his service.” 
And Moses takes the wagons and the oxen, and gives them to the Levites. 
He has given the two wagons and the four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service, 
and he has given the four wagons and the eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest, 
but he has not given any to the sons of Kohath, for the service of the holy place is on them, which they carry on the shoulder. 
And the princes bring the dedication of the altar near in the day of its being anointed, indeed, the princes bring their offering near before the altar. 
And YHWH says to Moses, “One prince a day, one prince a day—they bring their offering near for the dedication of the altar.”
