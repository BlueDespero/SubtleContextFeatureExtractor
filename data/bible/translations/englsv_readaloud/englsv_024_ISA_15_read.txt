Isaiah.
Chapter 15.
The burden of Moab. Because in a night Ar of Moab was destroyed—It has been cut off, || Because in a night Kir of Moab was destroyed—It has been cut off. 
He has gone up to Bajith and Dibon, || The high places—to weep, || Moab howls on Nebo and on Medeba, || Baldness is on all its heads, every beard cut off. 
In its out-places they girded on sackcloth, || On its pinnacles, and in its broad places, || Everyone howls—going down with weeping. 
And Heshbon and Elealeh cry, || Their voice has been heard to Jahaz, || Therefore the armed ones of Moab shout, || His life has been grievous to him. 
My heart is toward Moab, || Her fugitives cry to Zoar, a heifer of the third year, || For—the ascent of Luhith—He goes up in it with weeping, || For in the way of Horonaim, || They wake up a cry of destruction. 
For the waters of Nimrim are desolations, || For the hay has been withered, || The tender grass has been finished, || There has not been a green thing. 
Therefore the abundance he made, and their store, || They carry to the Brook of the Willows. 
For the cry has gone around the border of Moab, || Its howling is to Eglaim, || And its howling is to Beer-Elim. 
For the waters of Dimon have been full of blood, || For I set additions on Dimon, || A lion for the escaped of Moab, || And for the remnant of Adamah!
