Isaiah.
Chapter 37.
And it comes to pass, at King Hezekiah’s hearing, that he tears his garments, and covers himself with sackcloth, and enters the house of YHWH, 
and sends Eliakim, who is over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elderly of the priests, covering themselves with sackcloth, to Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, 
and they say to him, “Thus said Hezekiah: A day of distress, and rebuke, and despising, is this day; for sons have come to the birth, and there is not power to bear. 
It may be your God YHWH hears the words of Rabshakeh with which the king of Asshur his lord has sent him to reproach the living God, and has decided concerning the words that your God YHWH has heard, and you have lifted up prayer for the remnant that is found.” 
And the servants of King Hezekiah come to Isaiah, 
and Isaiah says to them, “Thus you say to your lord, Thus said YHWH: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Asshur have reviled Me. 
Behold, I am giving a spirit in him, and he has heard a report, and has turned back to his land, and I have caused him to fall by the sword in his land.” 
And Rabshakeh turns back and finds the king of Asshur fighting against Libnah, for he has heard that he has journeyed from Lachish. 
And he hears concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, “He has come out to fight with you”; and he hears, and sends messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
“Thus you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God in whom you are trusting lift you up, saying, Jerusalem is not given into the hand of the king of Asshur. 
Behold, you have heard that which the kings of Asshur have done to all the lands—to devote them—and you are delivered! 
Did the gods of the nations deliver them whom my fathers destroyed—Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who are in Telassar? 
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?” 
And Hezekiah takes the letters out of the hand of the messengers, and reads them, and Hezekiah goes up to the house of YHWH, and Hezekiah spreads it before YHWH. 
And Hezekiah prays to YHWH, saying, 
“YHWH of Hosts, God of Israel, inhabiting the cherubim, You are God Himself—You alone—to all kingdoms of the earth, You have made the heavens and the earth. 
Incline, O YHWH, Your ear, and hear; open, O YHWH, Your eyes and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib that he has sent to reproach the living God. 
Truly, O YHWH, kings of Asshur have laid waste all the lands and their land, 
so as to put their gods into fire—for they are no gods, but work of the hands of man, wood and stone—and they destroy them. 
And now, our God YHWH, save us from his hand, and all kingdoms of the earth know that You are YHWH, You alone.” 
And Isaiah son of Amoz sends to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus said YHWH, God of Israel: That which you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Asshur— 
this is the word that YHWH spoke concerning him: Trampled on you, laughed at you, || Has the virgin daughter of Zion, || The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken the head behind you. 
Whom have you reproached and reviled? And against whom—lifted up the voice? Indeed, you lift up your eyes on high || Against the Holy One of Israel. 
By the hand of your servants || You have reviled the Lord, and say: In the multitude of my chariots || I have come up to a high place of hills, || The sides of Lebanon, || And I cut down the height of its cedars, || The choice of its firs, || And I enter the high place of its extremity, || The forest of its Carmel. 
I have dug and drunk waters, || And I dry up with the sole of my steps || All floods of a bulwark. 
Have you not heard from afar that I did it, || From days of old—that I formed it? Now I have brought it in, || And it is to make desolate, || Ruinous heaps—fortified cities, 
And their inhabitants are feeble-handed, || They were broken down, and are dried up. They have been the herb of the field, || And the greenness of the tender grass, || Grass of the roofs, || And blasted grain, before it has risen up. 
And your sitting down, and your going out, || And your coming in, I have known, || And your anger toward Me. 
Because of your anger toward Me, || And your noise—it came up into My ears, || I have put My hook in your nose, || And My bridle in your lips, || And I have caused you to turn back || In the way in which you came. 
And this is the sign to you, || Self-sown grain is food of the year, || And in the second year the spontaneous growth, || And in the third year, sow and reap, || And plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 
And it has continued—The escaped of the house of Judah that has been left—To take root beneath, || And it has made fruit upward. 
For a remnant goes forth from Jerusalem, || And an escape from Mount Zion, || The zeal of YHWH of Hosts does this. 
Therefore, thus said YHWH, || Concerning the king of Asshur: He does not come into this city, || Nor does he shoot an arrow there, || Nor does he come before it with shield, || Nor does he pour out a mound against it. 
In the way that he came, in it he turns back, || And to this city he does not come in, || A declaration of YHWH, 
And I have covered over this city, || To save it, for My own sake, || And for the sake of My servant David.” 
And a messenger of YHWH goes out, and strikes in the camp of Asshur one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and men rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them are dead corpses. 
And he journeys, and goes, and Sennacherib king of Asshur turns back, and dwells in Nineveh. 
And it comes to pass, he is bowing himself in the house of his god Nisroch, and his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer have struck him with the sword, and they have escaped to the land of Ararat, and his son Esar-Haddon reigns in his stead.
