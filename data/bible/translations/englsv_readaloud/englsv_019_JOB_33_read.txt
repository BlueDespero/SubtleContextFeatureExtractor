Job.
Chapter 33.
“And yet, please, O Job, || Hear my speech and give ear to all my words. 
Now behold, I have opened my mouth, || My tongue has spoken in the palate. 
Of the uprightness of my heart are my sayings, || And my lips have clearly spoken knowledge. 
The Spirit of God has made me, || And the breath of the Mighty quickens me. 
If you are able—answer me, || Set in array before me—station yourself. 
Behold, I am, according to your word, for God, || I have also been formed from the clay. 
Behold, my terror does not frighten you, || And my burden on you is not heavy. 
Surely you have spoken in my ears, || And the sounds of words I hear: 
I am pure, without transgression, || I am innocent, and I have no iniquity. 
Behold, He develops hindrances against me, || He reckons me for an enemy to Him, 
He puts my feet in the stocks, || He watches all my paths. 
Behold, you have not been righteous in this, || I answer you, that God is greater than man. 
Why have you striven against Him, || When for all His matters He does not answer? 
For once God speaks, and twice (he does not behold it), 
In a dream—a vision of night, || In the falling of deep sleep on men, || In slumberings on a bed. 
Then He uncovers the ear of men, || And seals for their instruction, 
To turn aside man from doing, || And He conceals pride from man. 
He keeps back his soul from corruption, || And his life from passing away by a dart. 
And he has been reproved || With pain on his bed, || And the strife of his bones is enduring. 
And his life has nauseated bread, || And his soul desirable food. 
His flesh is consumed from being seen, || And his bones are high, they were not seen! 
And his soul draws near to the pit, || And his life to those causing death. 
If there is a messenger by him, || An interpreter—one of a thousand, || To declare for man his uprightness, 
Then He favors him and says, || Ransom him from going down to the pit, || I have found an atonement. 
Fresher is his flesh than a child’s, || He returns to the days of his youth. 
He makes supplication to God, || And He accepts him. And he sees His face with shouting, || And He returns to man His righteousness. 
Then he looks on men and says, || I sinned, and I have perverted uprightness, || And it has not been profitable to me. 
He has ransomed my soul || From going over into the pit, || And my life looks on the light. 
Behold, God works all these, || Twice, even three times with man, 
To bring back his soul from the pit, || To be enlightened with the light of the living. 
Attend, O Job, listen to me, || Keep silent, and I speak. 
If there are words—answer me, || Speak, for I have a desire to justify you. 
If there are not—listen to me, || Keep silent, and I teach you wisdom.”
