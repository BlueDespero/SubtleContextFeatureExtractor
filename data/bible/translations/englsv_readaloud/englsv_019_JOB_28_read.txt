Job.
Chapter 28.
“Surely there is a source for silver, || And a place for the gold they refine; 
Iron is taken from the dust, || And bronze from the firm stone. 
He has set an end to darkness, || And he is searching to all perfection, || A stone of darkness and death-shade. 
A stream has broken out from a sojourner, || Those forgotten of the foot, || They were low, they wandered from man. 
The earth! Bread comes forth from it, || And its under-part is turned like fire. 
A place of the sapphire are its stones, || And it has dust of gold. 
A path—a ravenous bird has not known it, || Nor has an eye of the falcon scorched it, 
Nor have the sons of pride trodden it, || The fierce lion has not passed over it. 
He sent forth his hand against the flint, || He overturned mountains from the root. 
Among rocks, he has cleaved brooks, || And his eye has seen every precious thing. 
He has bound overflowing rivers, || And the hidden thing brings out to light. 
And the wisdom—from where is it found? And where is this, the place of understanding? 
Man has not known its arrangement, || Nor is it found in the land of the living. 
The deep has said, It is not in me, || And the sea has said, It is not with me. 
Gold is not given for it, || Nor is silver weighed—its price. 
It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, || With precious onyx and sapphire, 
Gold and crystal do not equal it, || Nor is its exchange a vessel of fine gold. 
Corals and pearl are not remembered, || The acquisition of wisdom is above rubies. 
The topaz of Cush does not equal it, || It is not valued with pure gold. 
And the wisdom—from where does it come? And where is this, the place of understanding? 
It has been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the bird of the heavens || It has been hidden. 
Destruction and death have said: With our ears we have heard its fame. 
God has understood its way, || And He has known its place. 
For He looks to the ends of the earth, || He sees under the whole heavens, 
To make a weight for the wind, || And He meted out the waters in measure. 
In His making for the rain a limit, || And a way for the brightness of the voices, 
Then He has seen and declares it, || He has prepared it, and also searched it out, 
And He says to man: Behold, fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, || And to turn from evil is understanding.”
