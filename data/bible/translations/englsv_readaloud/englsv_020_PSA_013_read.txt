Psalms.
Chapter 13.
TO THE OVERSEER. A PSALM OF DAVID. Until when, O YHWH, || Do You forget me forever? Until when do You hide Your face from me? 
Until when do I set counsels in my soul, || With sorrow in my heart daily? Until when is my enemy exalted over me? 
Look attentively; Answer me, O YHWH, my God, || Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death, 
Lest my enemy say, “I overcame him,” || My adversaries rejoice when I am moved. 
And I have trusted in Your kindness, || My heart rejoices in Your salvation. 
I sing to YHWH, || For He has conferred benefits on me!
