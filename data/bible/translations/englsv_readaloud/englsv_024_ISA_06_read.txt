Isaiah.
Chapter 6.
In the year of the death of King Uzziah—I see the Lord, sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train is filling the temple. 
Seraphim are standing above it: each one has six wings; with two each covers its face, and with two each covers its feet, and with two each flies. 
And this one has called to that, and has said: “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, is YHWH of Hosts, || The fullness of all the earth is His glory!” 
And the posts of the thresholds are moved by the voice of him who is calling, and the house is full of smoke. 
And I say, “Woe to me, for I have been silent, || For I am a man of unclean lips, || And I am dwelling in the midst of a people of unclean lips, || Because the King, YHWH of Hosts, my eyes have seen.” 
And one of the seraphim flees to me, and in his hand—a burning coal (with tongs he has taken it from off the altar), 
and he strikes against my mouth and says: “Behold, this has struck against your lips, || And your iniquity is turned aside, || And your sin is covered.” 
And I hear the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom do I send? And who goes for Us?” And I say, “Here I am, send me.” 
And He says, “Go, and you have said to this people, Hearing you hear, and you do not understand, || And seeing you see, and you do not know. 
Declare the heart of this people fat, || And declare its ears heavy, || And declare its eyes dazzled, || Lest it see with its eyes, || And hear with its ears, and consider with its heart, || And it has turned back, and has health.” 
And I say, “Until when, O Lord?” And He says, “Surely until cities have been ruined without inhabitant, || And houses without man, || And the ground is ruined—a desolation, 
And YHWH has put man far off, || And the forsaken part is great in the heart of the land. 
And yet a tenth in it, and it has turned, || And has been for a burning, || As a teil-tree, and as an oak, that in falling, || Has substance in them, || The holy seed is its substance!”
