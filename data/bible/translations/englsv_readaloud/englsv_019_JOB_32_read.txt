Job.
Chapter 32.
And these three men cease from answering Job, for he is righteous in his own eyes, 
and the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite burns, of the family of Ram; his anger has burned against Job, because of his justifying himself more than God; 
and his anger has burned against his three friends, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job. 
And Elihu has waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days. 
And Elihu sees that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burns. 
And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answers and says: “I am young in days, and you are aged; Therefore I have feared, || And am afraid of showing you my opinion. 
I said, Days speak, || And a multitude of years teach wisdom. 
Surely a spirit is in man, || And the breath of the Mighty One || Causes them to understand. 
The multitude are not wise, || Nor do the aged understand judgment. 
Therefore I have said: Listen to me, I show my opinion—even I. 
Behold, I have waited for your words, I give ear to your reasons, || Until you search out sayings. 
And to you I attend, || And behold, there is no reasoner for Job, || Or answerer of his sayings among you. 
Lest you say, We have found wisdom, || God thrusts him away, not man. 
And he has not set words in array for me, || And I do not answer him with your sayings. 
(They have broken down, || They have not answered again, || They removed words from themselves. 
And I have waited, but they do not speak, || For they have stood still, || They have not answered anymore.) 
I answer, even I—my share, || I show my opinion—even I. 
For I have been full of words, || The spirit of my breast has distressed me, 
Behold, my breast is as wine not opened, || It is broken up like new bottles. 
I speak, and there is refreshment to me, || I open my lips and answer. 
Please do not let me accept the face of any, || Nor give flattering titles to man, 
For I have not known to give flattering titles, || My Maker takes me away in a little.”
