Malachi.
Chapter 4.
“For behold, the day has come, burning as a furnace, || When all the proud and all those doing wickedness have been stubble, || And the day that came has burned them,” said YHWH of Hosts, || “That there is not left to them root or branch, 
But for you fearing My Name, || The Sun of Righteousness has risen with healing in His wings, || And you have gone forth, || And have bounded as calves of a stall. 
And you have trodden down the wicked, || For they are ashes under the soles of your feet, || In the day that I am appointing,” said YHWH of Hosts. 
“Remember the Law of My servant Moses, || That I commanded him in Horeb, || For all Israel—statutes and judgments. 
Behold, I am sending Elijah the prophet to you, || Before the coming of the great and fearful Day of YHWH. 
And he has turned back the heart of fathers to sons, || And the heart of sons to their fathers, || Before I come and have utterly struck the land!”
