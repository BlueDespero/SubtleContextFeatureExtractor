Proverbs.
Chapter 31.
Words of Lemuel, a king, a declaration that his mother taught him: 
“What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows? 
Do not give your strength to women, || And your ways to wiping away of kings. 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, || Not for kings, to drink wine, || And for princes—a desire of strong drink. 
Lest he drink, and forget the decree, || And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction. 
Give strong drink to the perishing, || And wine to the bitter in soul, 
He drinks, and forgets his poverty, || And he does not remember his misery again. 
Open your mouth for the mute, || For the right of all sons of change. 
Open your mouth, judge righteously, || Both the cause of the poor and needy!” 
ALEPH-BET A woman of worth who finds? Indeed, her price is far above rubies. 
The heart of her husband has trusted in her, || And he does not lack spoil. 
She has done him good, and not evil, || All the days of her life. 
She has sought wool and flax, || And with delight she works with her hands. 
She has been as ships of the merchant, || She brings in her bread from afar. 
Indeed, she rises while yet night, || And gives food to her household, || And a portion to her girls. 
She has considered a field, and takes it, || She has planted a vineyard from the fruit of her hands. 
She has girded her loins with might, || And strengthens her arms. 
She has perceived when her merchandise is good, || Her lamp is not extinguished in the night. 
She has sent forth her hands on a spindle, || And her hands have held a distaff. 
She has spread forth her hand to the poor, || Indeed, she sent forth her hands to the needy. 
She is not afraid of her household from snow, || For all her household are clothed with scarlet. 
She has made ornamental coverings for herself, || Silk and purple are her clothing. 
Her husband is known in the gates, || In his sitting with the elderly of the land. 
She has made linen garments, and sells, || And she has given a girdle to the merchant. 
Strength and honor are her clothing, || And she rejoices at a latter day. 
She has opened her mouth in wisdom, || And the law of kindness is on her tongue. 
She is watching the ways of her household, || And she does not eat bread of sloth. 
Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her blessed, || Her husband, and he praises her, 
“The daughters who have done worthily are many, || You have gone up above them all.” 
Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain, || A woman fearing YHWH, she may boast herself. 
Give to her of the fruit of her hands, || And her works praise her in the gates!
