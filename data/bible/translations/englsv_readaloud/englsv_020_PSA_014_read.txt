Psalms.
Chapter 14.
TO THE OVERSEER. BY DAVID. A fool has said in his heart, “There is no God”; They have done corruptly, || They have done abominable actions, || There is not a doer of good. 
YHWH has looked from the heavens on the sons of men, || To see if there is a wise one—seeking God. 
The whole have turned aside, || Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one. 
Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, || They have not called YHWH. 
They have feared a fear there, || For God is in the generation of the righteous. 
You cause the counsel of the poor to stink, || Because YHWH is his refuge. 
“Who gives the salvation of Israel from Zion?” When YHWH turns back || To a captivity of His people, || Jacob rejoices—Israel is glad!
