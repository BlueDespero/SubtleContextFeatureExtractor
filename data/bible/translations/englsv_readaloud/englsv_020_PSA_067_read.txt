Psalms.
Chapter 67.
TO THE OVERSEER. WITH STRINGED INSTRUMENTS. A PSALM. A SONG. God favors us and blesses us, || And causes His face to shine with us. Selah. 
For the knowledge of Your way in earth, || Your salvation among all nations. 
Peoples praise You, O God, || Peoples praise You, all of them. 
Nations rejoice and sing, || For You judge peoples uprightly, || And comfort peoples on earth. Selah. 
Peoples confess You, O God, || Peoples confess You—all of them. 
Earth has given her increase, God blesses us—our God, 
God blesses us, and all the ends of the earth fear Him!
