The Song of Songs.
Chapter 1.
The Song of Songs, that is of Solomon. 
Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, || For better are your loves than wine. 
For fragrance are your good perfumes. Perfume emptied out—your name, || Therefore have virgins loved you! 
Draw me: we run after you, || The king has brought me into his inner chambers, || We delight and rejoice in you, || We mention your loves more than wine, || Uprightly they have loved you! 
I am dark and lovely, daughters of Jerusalem, as tents of Kedar, as curtains of Solomon. 
Do not fear me, because I am very dark, || Because the sun has scorched me, || The sons of my mother were angry with me, || They made me keeper of the vineyards, || My vineyard—my own—I have not kept. 
Declare to me, you whom my soul has loved, || Where you delight, || Where you lie down at noon, || For why am I as one veiled, || By the ranks of your companions? 
If you do not know, || O beautiful among women, || Go forth by the traces of the flock, || And feed your kids by the shepherds’ dwellings! 
To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh, I have compared you, my friend, 
Your cheeks have been lovely with garlands, your neck with chains. 
We make garlands of gold for you, with studs of silver! 
While the king is in his circle, || My spikenard has given its fragrance. 
A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, || Between my breasts it lodges. 
A cluster of cypress is my beloved to me, || In the vineyards of En-Gedi! 
Behold, you are beautiful, my friend, || Behold, you are beautiful, your eyes are doves! 
Behold, you are beautiful, my love, indeed, pleasant, || Indeed, our bed is green, 
The beams of our houses are cedars, || Our rafters are firs, I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys!
