Leviticus.
Chapter 12.
And YHWH speaks to Moses, saying, 
“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she gives seed, and has borne a male, then she has been unclean for seven days; she is unclean according to the days of separation for her sickness; 
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin is circumcised; 
and she abides in the blood of her cleansing for thirty-three days; she does not come against any holy thing, and she does not go into the sanctuary, until the fullness of the days of her cleansing. 
And if she bears a female, then she has been unclean for two weeks, as in her separation; and she abides by the blood of her cleansing for sixty-six days. 
And in the fullness of the days of her cleansing for son or for daughter she brings in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering, to the opening of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest; 
and he has brought it near before YHWH, and has made atonement for her, and she has been cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who is bearing, in regard to a male or to a female. 
And if her hand does not find the sufficiency of a sheep, then she has taken two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt-offering and one for a sin-offering, and the priest has made atonement for her, and she has been cleansed.”
