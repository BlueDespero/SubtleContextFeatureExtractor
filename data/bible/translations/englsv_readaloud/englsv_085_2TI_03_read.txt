2 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
And know this, that in the last days there will come perilous times, 
for men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, slanderous, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unkind, 
without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, without control, barbaric, not lovers of those who are good, 
traitors, reckless, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, 
having a form of piety, but having denied its power; and be turning away from these, 
for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the weak women, loaded with sins, led away with manifold desires, 
always learning, and never able to come to a knowledge of truth, 
and even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so these also stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith; 
but they will not advance any further, for their folly will be evident to all, as theirs also became. 
And you have followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance, 
the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured! And the LORD delivered me out of all. 
And all who will to live piously in Christ Jesus will also be persecuted, 
and evil men and impostors will advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray. 
And you—remain in the things which you learned and were entrusted with, having known from whom you learned, 
and because you have known the Holy Writings from infancy, which are able to make you wise—to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
Every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction that is in righteousness, 
that the man of God may be fitted—having been completed for every good work.
