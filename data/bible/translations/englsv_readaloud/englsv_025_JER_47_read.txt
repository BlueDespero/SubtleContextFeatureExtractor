Jeremiah.
Chapter 47.
That which has been the word of YHWH to Jeremiah concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh strikes Gaza: 
“Thus said YHWH: Behold, waters are going up from the north, || And have been for an overflowing stream, || And they overflow the land and its fullness, || The city, and those dwelling in it, || And men have cried out, || And every inhabitant of the land has howled. 
From the sound of the stamping of the hooves of his mighty ones, || From the rushing of his chariot, || The noise of his wheels, || Fathers have not turned to sons, || From feebleness of hands, 
Because of the day that has come to spoil all the Philistines, || To cut off every helping remnant from Tyre and from Sidon. For YHWH is spoiling the Philistines, || The remnant of the island of Caphtor. 
Baldness has come to Gaza, || Ashkelon has been cut off, || O remnant of their valley, || Until when do you cut yourself? 
Behold, sword of YHWH, until when are you not quiet? Be removed to your sheath, rest and cease. 
How will it be quiet, || And YHWH has given a charge to it, || Against Ashkelon and against the seashore? He has appointed it there!”
