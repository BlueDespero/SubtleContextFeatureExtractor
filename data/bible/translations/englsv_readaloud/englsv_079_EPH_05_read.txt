Ephesians.
Chapter 5.
Become, then, followers of God, as beloved children, 
and walk in love, as the Christ also loved us, and gave Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a refreshing fragrance, 
and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, do not let it even be named among you, as is proper to holy ones; 
also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting—the things not fit—but rather thanksgiving; 
for you know this, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God. 
Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things comes the anger of God on the sons of the disobedience; 
do not become, then, partakers with them, 
for you were once darkness, and now light in the LORD; walk as children of light, 
for the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth, 
proving what is well-pleasing to the LORD; 
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict, 
for it is a shame even to speak of the things done by them in secret, 
and all the things reproved by the light are revealed, for everything that is revealed is light; 
for this reason it says, “Arouse yourself, you who are sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ will shine on you.” 
See, then, how exactly you walk, not as unwise, but as wise, 
redeeming the time, because the days are evil; 
do not become fools because of this, but—understanding what is the will of the LORD, 
and do not be drunk with wine, in which is wastefulness, but be filled in the Spirit, 
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the LORD, 
always giving thanks for all things, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father, 
subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ. 
The wives: subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the LORD, 
because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ is head of the Assembly, and He is Savior of the body, 
but even as the Assembly is subject to Christ, so also are the wives subject to their own husbands in everything. 
The husbands: love your own wives, as the Christ also loved the Assembly, and gave Himself for it, 
that He might sanctify it, having cleansed it with the bathing of the water in the saying, 
that He might present the Assembly to Himself in glory, having no spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished; 
so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife—he loves himself; 
for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and nurtures it, as also the LORD—the Assembly, 
because we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. 
“For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife, and the two will be into one flesh”; 
this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the Assembly; 
but you also, everyone in particular—let each so love his own wife as himself, and the wife—that she may revere the husband.
