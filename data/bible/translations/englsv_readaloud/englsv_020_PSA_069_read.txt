Chapter 69.
TO THE OVERSEER. SET ON “LILIES.” BY DAVID. Save me, O God, for waters have come to the soul. 
I have sunk in deep mire, || And there is no standing, || I have come into the depths of the waters, || And a flood has overflown me. 
I have been wearied with my calling, || My throat has been burned, || My eyes have been consumed, waiting for my God. 
Those hating me without cause || Have been more than the hairs of my head, || Mighty have been my destroyers, || My lying enemies, || That which I did not take away—I bring back. 
O God, You have known || Concerning my overturn, || And my desolations have not been hid from You. 
Do not let those waiting on You be ashamed because of me, || O Lord, YHWH of Hosts, || Do not let those seeking You || Blush because of me, || O God of Israel. 
For because of You I have borne reproach, || Shame has covered my face. 
I have been a stranger to my brother, || And a foreigner to sons of my mother. 
For my zeal for Your house has consumed me, || And the reproaches of Your reproachers || Have fallen on me. 
And I weep in the fasting of my soul, || And it is for a reproach to me. 
And I make my clothing sackcloth, || And I am for an allegory to them. 
Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, || And those drinking strong drink, || Play on instruments. 
And my prayer is to You, O YHWH, || A time of good pleasure, O God, || In the abundance of Your kindness, || Answer me in the truth of Your salvation. 
Deliver me from the mire, and do not let me sink, || Let me be delivered from those hating me, || And from deep places of waters. 
Do not let a flood of waters overflow me, || Nor let the deep swallow me up, || Nor let the pit shut her mouth on me. 
Answer me, O YHWH, for Your kindness is good, || Turn to me according to the abundance of Your mercies, 
And do not hide Your face from Your servant, || For I am in distress—hurry, answer me. 
Be near to my soul—redeem it, || Ransom me because of my enemies. 
You have known my reproach, || And my shame, and my blushing, || All my adversaries are before You. 
Reproach has broken my heart, and I am sick, || And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, || And for comforters, and I have found none. 
And they give gall for my food, || And cause me to drink vinegar for my thirst. 
Their table before them is for a snare, || And for a repayment—for a trap. 
Their eyes are darkened from seeing, || And their loins continually shake You. 
Pour Your indignation on them, || And the fierceness of Your anger seizes them. 
Their tower is desolated, || There is no dweller in their tents. 
For they have pursued him whom You have struck, || And recount of the pain of Your pierced ones. 
Give punishment for their iniquity, || And they do not enter into Your righteousness. 
They are blotted out of the scroll of life, || And are not written with the righteous. 
And I am afflicted and pained, || Your salvation, O God, sets me on high. 
I praise the Name of God with a song, || And I magnify Him with thanksgiving, 
And it is better to YHWH than an ox, || A bullock—horned and hoofed. 
The humble have seen—they rejoice, || You who seek God—and your heart lives. 
For YHWH listens to the needy, || And He has not despised His bound ones. 
The heavens and earth praise Him, || Seas, and every moving thing in them. 
For God saves Zion, || And builds the cities of Judah, || And they have dwelt there, and possess it. 
And the seed of His servants inherit it, || And those loving His Name dwell in it!
