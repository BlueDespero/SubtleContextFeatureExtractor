Exodus.
Chapter 11.
And YHWH says to Moses, “One more plague I bring in on Pharaoh and on Egypt, afterward he sends you away from this; when he is sending you away, he surely casts you out from this place altogether; 
now speak in the ears of the people, and they ask—each man from his neighbor, and each woman from her neighbor—for vessels of silver and vessels of gold.” 
And YHWH gives the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians; also the man Moses is very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of the people. 
And Moses says, “Thus said YHWH: About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt, 
and every firstborn in the land of Egypt has died, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne, to the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the millstones, and all the firstborn of beasts; 
and there has been a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, and such as there is not again; 
and against all the sons of Israel a dog does not sharpen its tongue, from man even to beast, so that you know that YHWH makes a separation between the Egyptians and Israel. 
And all these servants of yours have come down to me, and bowed themselves to me, saying, Go out, you and all the people who are at your feet; and afterward I go out”; and he goes out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger. 
And YHWH says to Moses, “Pharaoh does not listen to you, so as to multiply My wonders in the land of Egypt”; 
and Moses and Aaron have done all these wonders before Pharaoh, and YHWH strengthens Pharaoh’s heart, and he has not sent the sons of Israel out of his land.
