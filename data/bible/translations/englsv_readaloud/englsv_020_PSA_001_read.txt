The Book of Psalms.
Chapter 1.
O the blessedness of that one, || Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, || And has not stood in the way of sinners, || And has not sat in the seat of scorners; 
But his delight is in the Law of YHWH, || And in His law he meditates by day and by night: 
And he has been as a tree, || Planted by streams of water, || That gives its fruit in its season, || And its leaf does not wither, || And all that he does he causes to prosper. 
Not so the wicked: But they are as chaff that wind drives away! 
Therefore the wicked do not rise in judgment, || Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous, 
For YHWH is knowing the way of the righteous, || And the way of the wicked is lost!
