Psalms.
Chapter 72.
BY SOLOMON. O God, give Your judgments to the king, || And Your righteousness to the king’s Son. 
He judges Your people with righteousness, || And Your poor with judgment. 
The mountains bear peace to the people, || And the heights by righteousness. 
He judges the poor of the people, || Gives deliverance to the sons of the needy, || And bruises the oppressor. 
They fear You with the sun, and before the moon, || Generation—generations. 
He comes down as rain on mown grass, || As showers—sprinkling the earth. 
The righteous flourish in His days, || And abundance of peace until the moon is not. 
And He rules from sea to sea, || And from the river to the ends of the earth. 
Desert-dwellers bow before Him, || And His enemies lick the dust. 
Kings of Tarshish and of the islands send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba bring a reward near. 
And all kings bow themselves to Him, || All nations serve Him, 
For He delivers the needy who cries, || And the poor when he has no helper, 
He has pity on the poor and needy, || And He saves the souls of the needy, 
He redeems their soul from fraud and from violence, || And their blood is precious in His eyes. 
And He lives, and the gold of Sheba is given to Him, || And prayer is continually made for Him, || All day He is continually blessed. 
There is a handful of grain in the earth, || On the top of mountains, || Its fruit shakes like Lebanon, || And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth. 
His Name is for all time, || Before the sun is His Name continued, || And they bless themselves in Him, || All nations pronounce Him blessed. 
Blessed is YHWH God, God of Israel, || He alone is doing wonders, 
And blessed is the Name of His glory for all time, || And the whole earth is filled with His glory. Amen and amen! 
The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.
