Psalm.
Chapter 150.
Praise the LORD! Praise God in his Temple! Praise him in heaven, his strong fortress! 
Praise him for the great things he does! Praise him for all his greatness! 
Praise him with trumpets and horns! Praise him with harps and lyres! 
Praise him with tambourines and dancing! Praise him with stringed instruments and flutes! 
Praise him with loud cymbals! Praise him with crashing cymbals! 
Everything that breathes, praise the LORD! Praise the LORD!
