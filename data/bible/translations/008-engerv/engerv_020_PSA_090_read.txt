Psalm.
Chapter 90.
The prayer of Moses, the man of God. My Lord, you have been our home forever and ever. 
You were God before the mountains were born, before the earth and the world were made. You have always been and will always be God! 
You bring people into this world, and you change them into dust again. 
To you, a thousand years is like yesterday, like a few hours in the night. 
Our life is like a dream that ends when morning comes. We are like grass 
that grows and looks so fresh in the morning, but in the evening it is dry and dying. 
Your anger could destroy us. Your anger frightens us! 
You know about all our sins. You see every one of our secret sins. 
Your anger can end our life. Our lives fade away like a whisper. 
We live about 70 years or, if we are strong, 80 years. But most of them are filled with hard work and pain. Then, suddenly, the years are gone, and we fly away. 
No one really knows the full power of your anger, but our fear and respect for you is as great as your anger. 
Teach us how short our lives are so that we can become wise. 
LORD, come back to us. Be kind to your servants. 
Fill us with your love every morning. Let us be happy and enjoy our lives. 
For years you have made life hard for us and have given us many troubles. Now make us happy for just as long. 
Let your servants see the wonderful things you can do for them. And let their children see your glory. 
Lord, our God, be kind to us. Make everything we do successful. Yes, make it all successful.
