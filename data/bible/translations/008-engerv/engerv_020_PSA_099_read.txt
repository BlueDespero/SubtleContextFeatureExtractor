Psalm.
Chapter 99.
The LORD is King, so let the nations shake with fear. He sits as King above the Cherub angels, so let the whole earth shake. 
The LORD in Zion is great! He is the great leader over all people. 
Let all the nations praise your name. Your name is great and awesome. Your name is holy. 
You are the powerful King who loves justice. You have made things right. You have brought goodness and fairness to Jacob. 
Praise the LORD our God, and bow down before his footstool, for he is holy. 
Moses and Aaron were some of his priests, and Samuel was one of the men who called on his name. They prayed to the LORD, and he answered them. 
God spoke from the tall cloud, and they obeyed his commands and the law he gave them. 
LORD our God, you answered their prayers. You showed them that you are a forgiving God and that you punish people for the evil they do. 
Praise the LORD our God. Bow down toward his holy mountain and worship him. The LORD our God is holy!
