Psalm.
Chapter 77.
To the director, Jeduthun. One of Asaph’s songs. I cry out to God for help. I cry out to you, God; listen to me! 
My Lord, in my time of trouble I came to you. I reached out for you all night long. My soul refused to be comforted. 
I thought about you, God, and tried to tell you how I felt, but I could not. 
You would not let me sleep. I tried to say something, but I was too upset. 
I kept thinking about the past, about things that happened long ago. 
During the night, I thought about my songs. I talked to myself, trying to understand what is happening. 
I wondered, “Has our Lord rejected us forever? Will he ever accept us again? 
Is his love gone forever? Will he never again speak to us? 
Has God forgotten what mercy is? Has his compassion changed to anger?” Selah 
Then I said to myself, “What bothers me most is the thought that God Most High has lost his power.” 
LORD, I remember what you have done. I remember the amazing things you did long ago. 
I think about those things. I think about them all the time. 
God, all that you do is holy. No god is as great as you are. 
You are the God who does amazing things. You showed the nations your great power. 
By your power you saved your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 
God, the water saw you and became afraid. The deep water shook with fear. 
The thick clouds dropped their water. Thunder roared in the sky above. Your arrows of lightning flashed through the clouds. 
There were loud claps of thunder. Lightning lit up the world. The earth shook and trembled. 
You walked through the water and crossed the deep sea, but you left no footprints. 
You led your people like sheep, using Moses and Aaron to guide them.
