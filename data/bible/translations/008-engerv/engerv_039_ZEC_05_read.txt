Zechariah.
Chapter 5.
I looked up again, and I saw a flying scroll. 
The angel asked me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see a flying scroll that is 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.” 
Then the angel told me, “There is a curse written on that scroll. On one side of the scroll, there is a curse against thieves and on the other side is a curse against people who lie when they make promises. 
The LORD All-Powerful says, ‘I will send that scroll to the houses of thieves and people who lie when they use my name to make promises. That scroll will settle there and destroy even the stones and wooden posts of their houses.’” 
The angel who was talking to me went outside and said, “Look! What do you see coming?” 
I said, “I don’t know. What is it?” He said, “That is a measuring bucket.” He also said, “That bucket is for measuring the sins of the people in this country.” 
A lid made of lead was lifted off the bucket, and there was a woman in the bucket. 
The angel said, “The woman represents evil.” Then the angel pushed the woman down into the bucket and put the lead lid back on it. 
Then I looked up and saw two women with wings like a stork. They flew out, and with the wind in their wings, they picked up the bucket. They flew through the air carrying the bucket. 
Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they carrying the bucket?” 
The angel told me, “They are going to build a house for it in Babylonia. After they build that house, they will put the bucket there.”
