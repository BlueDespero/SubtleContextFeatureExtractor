Psalm.
Chapter 4.
To the director: With stringed instruments. A song of David. God, you showed that I was innocent. You gave me relief from all my troubles. So listen to me now when I call to you for help. Be kind to me and hear my prayer. 
Men, how long will you try to dishonor me? Do you enjoy wasting your time searching for new lies against me? Selah 
You can be sure that anyone who serves the LORD faithfully is special to him. The LORD listens when I pray to him. 
Tremble with fear, and stop sinning. Think about this when you go to bed, and calm down. Selah 
Give the right sacrifices to the LORD, and put your trust in him! 
Many people say, “I wish I could enjoy the good life. LORD, give us some of those blessings.” 
But you have made me happier than they will ever be with all their wine and grain. 
When I go to bed, I sleep in peace, because, LORD, you keep me safe.
