Psalm.
Chapter 108.
A praise song of David. God, I am ready, heart and soul, to sing songs of praise. Wake up, my soul! 
Harps and lyres, wake up, and let’s wake the dawn! 
LORD, I will praise you before all people. I will sing praises about you to every nation. 
Your faithful love is higher than the highest clouds in the sky! 
Rise above the heavens, God. Let all the world see your glory. 
Use your great power and help us! Answer my prayer and save the people you love. 
God has made this promise in his Temple: “I will win the war and rejoice in victory! I will divide this land among my people. I will give them Shechem. I will give them Succoth Valley. 
Gilead and Manasseh will be mine. Ephraim will be my helmet. Judah will be my royal scepter. 
Moab will be the bowl for washing my feet. Edom will be the slave who carries my sandals. I will defeat the Philistines and shout in victory!” 
But, God, it seems that you have left us! You do not go out with our army. So who will lead me into the strong, protected city? Who will lead me into battle against Edom? 
Help us defeat the enemy! No one on earth can rescue us. 
Only God can make us strong. Only God can defeat our enemies!
