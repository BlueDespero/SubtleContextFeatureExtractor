Psalm.
Chapter 121.
A song for going up to the Temple. I look up to the hills, but where will my help really come from? 
My help will come from the LORD, the Creator of heaven and earth. 
He will not let you fall. Your Protector will not fall asleep. 
Israel’s Protector does not get tired. He never sleeps. 
The LORD is your Protector. The LORD stands by your side, shading and protecting you. 
The sun cannot harm you during the day, and the moon cannot harm you at night. 
The LORD will protect you from every danger. He will protect your soul. 
The LORD will protect you as you come and go, both now and forever!
