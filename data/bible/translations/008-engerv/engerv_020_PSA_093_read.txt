Psalm.
Chapter 93.
The LORD is King. The LORD wears majesty and strength like clothes. He is ready, so the whole world is safe. It will not be shaken. 
Your kingdom has continued forever. You have lived forever! 
LORD, the ocean roars. The mighty ocean sounds like thunder as the waves crash on the shore. 
The crashing waves of the sea are loud and powerful, but the LORD above is even more powerful. 
LORD, your laws will continue forever. Your holy Temple will stand for a long time.
