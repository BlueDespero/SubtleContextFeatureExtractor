Psalm.
Chapter 29.
A song of David. Praise the LORD, you heavenly angels! Praise the LORD’S glory and power. 
Praise the LORD and honor his name! Worship the LORD in all his holy beauty. 
The LORD’S voice can be heard over the sea. The voice of our glorious LORD God is like thunder over the great ocean. 
The LORD’S voice is powerful. It shows the LORD’S glory. 
The LORD’S voice shatters great cedar trees. The LORD breaks the great cedars of Lebanon. 
He makes Lebanon shake like a young calf dancing. Sirion trembles like a young bull jumping up and down. 
The LORD’S voice cuts the air with flashes of lightning. 
The LORD’S voice shakes the desert. The desert of Kadesh trembles at the LORD’S voice. 
The LORD’S voice frightens the deer. He destroys the forests. In his temple everyone shouts, “Glory to God!” 
The LORD ruled as king at the time of the flood, and the LORD will rule as king forever. 
May the LORD make his people strong. May the LORD bless his people with peace.
