Song of Songs.
Chapter 1.
Solomon’s Most Wonderful Song. 
Cover me with kisses, for your love is better than wine. 
Your perfume smells wonderful, but your name is sweeter than the best perfume. That is why the young women love you. 
Take me with you. Let’s run away. The king took me into his room. We will rejoice and be happy for you. Remember, your love is better than wine. With good reason, the young women love you. 
Daughters of Jerusalem, I am dark and beautiful, as black as the tents of Kedar and Salma. 
Don’t look at how dark I am, at how dark the sun has made me. My brothers were angry with me. They forced me to take care of their vineyards, so I could not take care of myself. 
I love you with all my soul! Tell me, where do you feed your sheep? Where do you lay them down at noon? I should come to be with you or I will be like a hired woman caring for the sheep of your friends. 
You are such a beautiful woman. Surely you know what to do. Go, follow the sheep. Feed your young goats near the shepherds’ tents. 
My darling, you are more exciting to me than any mare among the stallions pulling Pharaoh’s chariots. 
Your cheeks are so beautiful with those ornaments hanging beside them. Your neck is so lovely under that beautiful string of jewels. 
Let’s make you some more gold jewelry and decorate it with silver. 
The smell of my perfume reaches out to the king lying on his couch. 
My lover is like the small bag of myrrh around my neck, lying all night between my breasts. 
My lover is like a bunch of henna flowers near the vineyards of En Gedi. 
My darling, you are so beautiful! Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are like doves. 
You are so handsome, my lover! Yes, and so charming! Our bed is so fresh and pleasant. 
The beams of our house are cedar. The rafters are fir.
