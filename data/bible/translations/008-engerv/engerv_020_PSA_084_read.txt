Psalm.
Chapter 84.
To the director: On the gittith. A song of praise from the Korah family. LORD All-Powerful, the place where you live is so beautiful! 
LORD, I cannot wait to enter your Temple. I am so excited! Every part of me cries out to be with the Living God. 
LORD All-Powerful, my King, my God, even the birds have found a home in your Temple. They make their nests near your altar, and there they have their babies. 
Great blessings belong to those who live at your Temple! They continue to praise you. Selah 
Great blessings belong to those who depend on you for strength! Their heart’s desire is to make the trip to your Temple. 
They travel through Baca Valley, which God has made into a place of springs. Autumn rains form pools of water there. 
The people travel from town to town on their way to Zion, where they will meet with God. 
LORD God All-Powerful, listen to my prayer. God of Jacob, listen to me. Selah 
God, watch over the king, our protector. Be kind to him, the one you have chosen. 
One day in your Temple is better than a thousand days anywhere else. Serving as a guard at the gate of my God’s house is better than living in the homes of the wicked. 
The LORD God is our protector and glorious king. He blesses us with kindness and honor. The LORD freely gives every good thing to those who do what is right. 
LORD All-Powerful, great blessings belong to those who trust in you!
