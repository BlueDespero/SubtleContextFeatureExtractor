Psalm.
Chapter 63.
A song of David written when he was in the desert of Judah. God, you are my God. I am searching so hard to find you. Body and soul, I thirst for you in this dry and weary land without water. 
Yes, I have seen you in your Temple. I have seen your strength and glory. 
Your faithful love is better than life, so my lips praise you. 
By my life, I will praise you. In your name, I lift my hands in prayer. 
When I sit down to satisfy my hunger, my joyful lips hunger to praise you! 
I remember you while lying on my bed. I think about you in the middle of the night. 
That is because you are the one who helps me. It makes me happy to be under your protection! 
I stay close to you, and you hold me with your powerful arm. 
Those who are trying to kill me will be destroyed. They will go down to their graves. 
They will be killed with swords. Wild dogs will eat their dead bodies. 
But the king will be happy with his God, and those who promised to obey him will praise him when he defeats those liars.
