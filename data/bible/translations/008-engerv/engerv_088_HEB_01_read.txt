Hebrews.
Chapter 1.
In the past God spoke to our people through the prophets. He spoke to them many times and in many different ways. 
And now in these last days, God has spoken to us again through his Son. He made the whole world through his Son. And he has chosen his Son to have all things. 
The Son shows the glory of God. He is a perfect copy of God’s nature, and he holds everything together by his powerful command. The Son made people clean from their sins. Then he sat down at the right side of God, the Great One in heaven. 
The Son became much greater than the angels, and God gave him a name that is much greater than any of their names. 
God never said this to any of the angels: “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.” God also never said about an angel, “I will be his Father, and he will be my son.” 
And then, when God presents his firstborn Son to the world, he says, “Let all God’s angels worship him.” 
This is what God said about the angels: “He changes his angels into winds and his servants into flaming fire.” 
But this is what he said about his Son: “God, your kingdom will last forever and ever. You use your authority for justice. 
You love what is right and hate what is wrong. So God, your God, has chosen you, giving you more honor and joy than anyone like you.” 
God also said, “O Lord, in the beginning you made the earth, and your hands made the sky. 
These things will disappear, but you will stay. They will all wear out like old clothes. 
You will fold them up like a coat, and they will be changed like clothes. But you never change, and your life will never end.” 
And God never said this to an angel: “Sit at my right side until I put your enemies under your power.” 
All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation.
