Psalm.
Chapter 67.
To the director: With instruments. A song of praise. God, show mercy to us and bless us. Please accept us! Selah 
Let everyone on earth learn about you. Let every nation see how you save people. 
May people praise you, God! May all people praise you. 
May all nations rejoice and be happy because you judge people fairly. You rule over every nation. 
May the people praise you, God! May all people praise you. 
God, our God, bless us. Let our land give us a great harvest. 
May God bless us, and may all people on earth fear and respect him.
