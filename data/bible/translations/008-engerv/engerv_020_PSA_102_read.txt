Psalm.
Chapter 102.
A prayer for a time of suffering, when anyone feels weak and wants to tell their complaints to the LORD. LORD, hear my prayer. Listen to my cry for help. 
Don’t turn away from me when I have troubles. Listen to me, and answer me quickly when I cry for help. 
My life is passing away like smoke. My life is like a fire slowly burning out. 
My strength is gone— I am like dry, dying grass. I even forget to eat. 
Because of my sadness, I am losing so much weight that my skin hangs from my bones. 
I am lonely, like an owl living in the desert, like an owl living among old ruined buildings. 
I cannot sleep. I am like a lonely bird on the roof. 
My enemies insult me all the time. They make fun of me and use me as an example in their curses. 
My great sadness is my only food. My tears fall into my drink. 
You were angry with me, so you picked me up and threw me away. 
My life is almost finished, like the long shadows at the end of the day. I am like dry and dying grass. 
But you, LORD, will rule as king forever! Your name will continue forever and ever! 
You will rise up and comfort Zion. The time has come for you to be kind to Zion. 
Your servants love her stones. They love even the dust of that city! 
The nations will worship the LORD’S name. All the kings on earth will honor you. 
The LORD will rebuild Zion, and people will again see her glory. 
He will listen to the prayers of those in poverty. He will not ignore them. 
Write these things for future generations, so that they will praise the LORD. 
The LORD will look down from his Holy Place above. He will look down at the earth from heaven. 
And he will hear the prisoner’s prayers. He will free those who were condemned to die. 
Then people in Zion will tell about the LORD. They will praise his name in Jerusalem 
when nations gather together and kingdoms come to serve the LORD. 
My strength failed me. My life is cut short. 
So I said, “Don’t let me die while I am still young. God, you will live forever and ever! 
Long ago, you made the world. You made the sky with your own hands! 
The earth and sky will end, but you will live forever! They will wear out like clothes, and like clothes, you will change them. 
But you never change. You will live forever! 
We are your servants today. Our children will live here, and their descendants will come here to worship you.”
