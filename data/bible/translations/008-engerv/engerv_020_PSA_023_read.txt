Psalm.
Chapter 23.
A song of David. The LORD is my shepherd. I will always have everything I need. 
He gives me green pastures to lie in. He leads me by calm pools of water. 
He restores my strength. He leads me on right paths to show that he is good. 
Even if I walk through a valley as dark as the grave, I will not be afraid of any danger, because you are with me. Your rod and staff comfort me. 
You prepared a meal for me in front of my enemies. You welcomed me as an honored guest. My cup is full and spilling over. 
Your goodness and mercy will be with me all my life, and I will live in the LORD’S house a long, long time.
