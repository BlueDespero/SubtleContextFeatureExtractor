Psalm.
Chapter 21.
To the director: A song of David. LORD, your strength makes the king happy. He is so happy when you give him victory. 
And you gave him what he wanted. You gave him what he asked for. Selah 
You gave the king such wonderful blessings. You put a golden crown on his head. 
He asked for life, and you gave it. You gave him life that goes on forever. 
You led him to victory that brought him great glory. You gave him honor and fame. 
You have given him blessings that will last forever. You have given him the joy of being near you. 
The king trusts in the LORD, and the faithful love of God Most High will keep him from falling. 
Lord, you will show all your enemies that you are strong. Your power will defeat those who hate you. 
When you appear, you will burn them up like a blazing furnace. In your anger, LORD, you will completely destroy them; they will be swallowed by flames of fire. 
Their families will be destroyed. They will be removed from the earth. 
That is because they made evil plans against you. They wanted to do things they could not do. 
You will make them turn and run away when you aim your arrows at their faces. 
LORD, we lift you up with our songs of praise. We sing and play songs about your power!
