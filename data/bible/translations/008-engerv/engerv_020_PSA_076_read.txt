Psalm.
Chapter 76.
To the director: With instruments. One of Asaph’s songs of praise. People in Judah know God. People in Israel respect his name. 
His Temple is in Salem. His house is on Mount Zion. 
There he shattered the arrows, shields, swords, and other weapons of war. Selah 
God, you are glorious coming back from the hills where you defeated your enemies. 
They thought they were strong, but now they lie dead in the fields. Their bodies are stripped of all they owned. They could not defend themselves. 
The God of Jacob shouted at them, and their army of chariots and horses fell dead. 
God, you are awesome! No one can stand against you when you are angry. 
You stood as judge and announced your decision. You saved the humble people of the land. From heaven you gave the decision, and the whole earth was silent and afraid. 
Even human anger can bring you honor when you use it to punish your enemies. 
People, you made promises to the LORD your God. Now give him what you promised. People everywhere fear and respect God, and they will bring gifts to him. 
God defeats great leaders; all the kings on earth fear him.
