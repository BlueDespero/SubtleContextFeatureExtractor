Job.
Chapter 6.
Then Job answered: 
“I wish my suffering could be weighed and all my trouble be put on the scales. 
They would be heavier than all the sand of the sea! That is why my words are so crazy. 
God All-Powerful has shot me with his arrows. My spirit feels their poison! God’s terrible weapons are lined up against me. 
Even a wild donkey does not complain when it has grass to eat. And a cow is quiet when it has food. 
Food without salt does not taste good, and the white of an egg has no taste. 
I refuse to touch that kind of food; it makes me sick! 
“I wish I could have what I ask for. I wish God would give me what I want. 
I wish he would crush me— just go ahead and kill me! 
Then I would be comforted by this one thing: Even through all this pain, I never refused to obey the commands of the Holy One. 
“With my strength gone, I have no hope to go on living. With nothing to look forward to, why should I be patient? 
I am not strong like a rock. My body is not made from bronze. 
I don’t have the power to help myself, because all hope of success has been taken away from me. 
“Friends should be loyal to you in times of trouble, even if you turn away from God All-Powerful. 
But I cannot depend on you, my brothers. You are like a stream that has no water when the weather is dry but is flooded when the rains come. 
In the winter, it is choked with ice and melting snow. 
But when the weather is hot and dry, the water stops flowing, and the stream disappears. 
It twists and turns along the way and then disappears into the desert. 
Traders from Tema search for it. Travelers from Sheba hope to find it. 
They are sure they can find water, but they will be disappointed. 
Now, you are like those streams. You see my troubles and are afraid. 
But have I ever asked you to help me? Did I ask you to offer a bribe for me from your wealth? 
No, and I never said, ‘Save me from my enemies!’ or ‘Save me from those who are cruel!’ 
“So now, teach me, and I will be quiet. Show me what I have done wrong. 
Honest words are powerful, but your arguments prove nothing. 
Do you plan to criticize me? Will you speak more tiring words? 
Are you the kind of people who would gamble for orphans and sell out your own friends? 
Now, look me in the face, and see that I am telling the truth! 
You need to start over and stop being so unfair! Think again, because I am innocent. 
I am not lying. I know right from wrong.
