Psalm.
Chapter 149.
Praise the LORD! Sing a new song to the LORD! Sing his praise in the assembly of his followers. 
Let Israel be happy with their Maker. Let the people of Zion rejoice with their King. 
Let them praise him by dancing and playing their tambourines and harps. 
The LORD is happy with his people. He did a wonderful thing for his humble people. He saved them! 
Let his followers rejoice in this victory! Let them sing for joy, even in their beds! 
Let the people shout praise to God. And with a sharp sword in their hand, 
let them take revenge on the other nations. Let them go punish those people. 
They will put their kings in chains and their leaders in chains of iron. 
They will punish those nations as God commanded. This is an honor for all his followers. Praise the LORD!
