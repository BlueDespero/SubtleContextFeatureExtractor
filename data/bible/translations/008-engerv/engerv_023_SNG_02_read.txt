Song of Songs.
Chapter 2.
I am a rose on the plain of Sharon, a lily in the valleys. 
My darling, among other women, you are like a lily among thorns! 
My lover, among other men, you are an apple tree among the wild trees in the forest! I enjoy sitting in my lover’s shadow; his fruit is so sweet to my taste. 
My lover took me to the wine house; his intent toward me was love. 
Strengthen me with raisins; refresh me with apples, because I am weak with love. 
My lover’s left arm is under my head, and his right arm holds me. 
Women of Jerusalem, promise me by the gazelles and wild deer, don’t awaken love, don’t arouse love, until I am ready. 
I hear my lover’s voice. Here it comes, jumping over the mountains, skipping over the hills. 
My lover is like a gazelle or a young deer. Look at him standing behind our wall, staring out the window, looking through the lattice. 
My lover speaks to me, “Get up, my darling, my beautiful one. Let’s go away! 
Look, winter is past, the rains have come and gone. 
The flowers are blooming in the fields. It’s time to sing! Listen, the doves have returned. 
Young figs are growing on the fig trees. Smell the vines in bloom. Get up, my darling, my beautiful one. Let’s go away!” 
My dove, hiding in the caves high on the cliff, hidden here on the mountain, let me see you, let me hear your voice. Your voice is so pleasant, and you are so beautiful! 
Catch the foxes for us— the little foxes that spoil the vineyard. Our vineyard is now in bloom. 
My lover is mine, and I am his! My lover feeds among the lilies, 
while the day breathes its last breath and the shadows run away. Turn, my lover, be like a gazelle or a young deer on the cleft mountains!
