Psalm.
Chapter 80.
To the director: To the tune “Lilies of the Agreement.” One of Asaph’s songs of praise. Shepherd of Israel, listen to us. You lead your people like sheep. You sit on your throne above the Cherub angels. Let us see you. 
Shepherd of Israel, show your greatness to the tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Come and save your people. 
God, accept us again. Smile down on us and save us! 
LORD God All-Powerful, when will you listen to our prayers? How long will you be angry with us? 
Instead of bread and water, you gave your people tears. 
You made us the target of everyone’s hatred. Our enemies make fun of us. 
God All-Powerful, accept us again. Smile down on us and save us! 
When you brought us out of Egypt, we were like your special vine. You forced other nations to leave this land, and you planted that vine here. 
You prepared the ground for it, and it sent its roots down deep and spread throughout the land. 
It covered the mountains, and its leaves shaded even the giant cedar trees. 
Its branches spread to the Mediterranean Sea, its shoots to the Euphrates River. 
God, why did you pull down the walls that protect your vine? Now everyone who passes by picks its grapes. 
Wild pigs come and ruin it. Wild animals eat the leaves. 
God All-Powerful, come back. Look down from heaven at your vine and protect it. 
Look at the vine you planted with your own hands. Look at the young plant you raised. 
Our enemies have cut it down and burned it up. Show them how angry you are and destroy them. 
Reach out and help your chosen one. Reach out to the people you raised up. 
Then we will never leave you. Let us live, and we will worship you. 
LORD God All-Powerful, accept us again. Smile down on us and save us!
