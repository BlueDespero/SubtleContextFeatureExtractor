Psalm.
Chapter 114.
The people of Israel escaped from Egypt. Yes, Jacob’s descendants left that foreign country. 
Then Judah became God’s special people, and Israel became his kingdom. 
The Red Sea saw this and ran away. The Jordan River turned and ran. 
The mountains danced like rams. The hills danced like lambs. 
Red Sea, why did you run away? Jordan River, why did you turn and run away? 
Mountains, why did you dance like rams? Hills, why did you dance like lambs? 
The earth shook in front of the Lord, the God of Jacob. 
He is the one who caused water to flow from a rock. He made a spring of water flow from that hard rock.
