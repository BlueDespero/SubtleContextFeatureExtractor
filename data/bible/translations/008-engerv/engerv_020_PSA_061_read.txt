Psalm.
Chapter 61.
To the director: With stringed instruments. A song of David. God, hear my cry for help. Listen to my prayer. 
From a faraway land I call to you for help. I feel so weak and helpless! Carry me to a high rock where no one can reach me. 
You are my place of safety, a strong tower that protects me from my enemies. 
I want to live in your tent forever. I want to hide where you can protect me. Selah 
God, you heard what I promised to give you, but everything your worshipers have comes from you. 
Give the king a long life. Let him live forever! 
Let him rule in your presence forever. Protect him with your faithful love. 
Then I will praise your name forever. Every day I will do what I promised.
