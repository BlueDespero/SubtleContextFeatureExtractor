Psalm.
Chapter 123.
A song for going up to the Temple. Lord, I look up and pray to you. You sit as King in heaven. 
A slave looks to his master to provide what he needs, and a servant girl depends on the woman she serves. So we depend on the LORD our God, waiting for him to have mercy on us. 
LORD, be merciful to us, because we have been insulted much too long. 
We have had enough of the hateful words of those proud people who make fun of us and show us no respect.
