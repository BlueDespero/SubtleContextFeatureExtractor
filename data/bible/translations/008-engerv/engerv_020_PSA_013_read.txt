Psalm.
Chapter 13.
To the director: A song of David. How long will you forget me, LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you refuse to accept me? 
How long must I wonder if you have forgotten me? How long must I feel this sadness in my heart? How long will my enemy win against me? 
LORD my God, look at me and give me an answer. Make me feel strong again, or I will die. 
If that happens, my enemy will say, “I beat him!” He will be so happy that he won. 
But I trust in your faithful love, Lord. I will be happy when you save me. 
Then I will sing to the LORD because he was so good to me.
