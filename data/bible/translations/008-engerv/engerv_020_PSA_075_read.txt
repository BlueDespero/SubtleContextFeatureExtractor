Psalm.
Chapter 75.
To the director: To the tune “Don’t Destroy.” One of Asaph’s songs of praise. We praise you, God! We praise you because you are near to us. We tell about the amazing things you have done. 
God says, “I have chosen a time for judgment, and I will judge fairly. 
The earth and all its people may shake, but I am the one who keeps it steady. Selah 
“To those who are proud I say, ‘Stop your boasting.’ I warn the wicked, ‘Don’t brag about how strong you are. 
Don’t be so sure that you will win. Don’t boast that victory is yours!’” 
There is no power on earth that can make a person important. 
God is the judge. He decides who will be important. He lifts one person up and brings another down. 
The LORD has a cup in his hand. It is filled with the poisoned wine of his anger. He will pour out this wine, and the wicked will drink it to the last drop. 
I will always tell people how great God is. I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 
God says, “I will take away any power the wicked have and give it to those who are good.”
