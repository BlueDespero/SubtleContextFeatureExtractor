Psalm.
Chapter 27.
A song of David. LORD, you are my Light and my Savior, so why should I be afraid of anyone? The LORD is where my life is safe, so I will be afraid of no one! 
Evil people might attack me. They might try to destroy my body. Yes, my enemies might attack me and try to destroy me, but they will stumble and fall. 
Even if an army surrounds me, I will not be afraid. Even if people attack me in war, I will trust in the Lord. 
I ask only one thing from the LORD. This is what I want most: Let me live in the LORD’S house all my life, enjoying the LORD’S beauty and spending time in his palace. 
He will protect me when I am in danger. He will hide me in his tent. He will take me up to his place of safety. 
If he will help me defeat the enemies around me, I will offer sacrifices in his tent with shouts of joy. I will sing and play songs to honor the LORD. 
LORD, hear my voice. Be kind and answer me. 
My heart told me to come to you, LORD, so I am coming to ask for your help. 
Don’t turn away from me. Don’t be angry with your servant. You are the only one who can help me. My God, don’t leave me all alone. You are my Savior. 
Even if my mother and father leave me, the LORD will take me in. 
I have enemies, LORD, so teach me your ways. Show me the right way to live. 
My enemies have attacked me. They have told lies about me and have tried to hurt me. 
But I really believe that I will see the LORD’S goodness before I die. 
Wait for the LORD’S help. Be strong and brave, and wait for the LORD’S help.
