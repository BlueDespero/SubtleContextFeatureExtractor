Psalm.
Chapter 64.
To the director: A song of David. God, listen to my complaint. Save me from the terrible threats of my enemies! 
Protect me from the secret plans of the wicked. Hide me from that gang of evil people. 
They sharpen their tongues to use like swords. They aim their poisonous words like arrows. 
Suddenly, from their hiding places, they let their arrows fly. They shoot to kill innocent people. 
They encourage each other to do wrong. They talk about setting traps and say, “No one will see them here! 
No one will discover our crime. We have the perfect plan!” Yes, people can be very tricky and hard to understand. 
But suddenly, God will shoot his arrows, and those wicked people will be hit. 
He will use their own words against them, and they will be destroyed. Then everyone who sees them will shake their heads in amazement. 
People will see what God has done. They will tell other people about him. Then everyone will learn more about God. They will learn to fear and respect him. 
Good people are happy to serve the LORD. They depend on him to protect them. All those who want to do right will praise him!
