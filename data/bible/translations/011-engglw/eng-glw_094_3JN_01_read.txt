John’s Third Letter.
Chapter 1.
The Elder, To the beloved Gaius, whom I sincerely love in truth: 
Beloved, I pray that in all ways you may prosper and be in good health, just as I know that your soul prospers. 
For I rejoiced greatly when some brothers came and testified about the truth that is in you, as indeed you do walk in the truth. 
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth. 
Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brothers and sisters, and especially when they are strangers. 
They have testified to your sincere love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God, 
for they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the heathen. 
Therefore we ought to support such people, that we may be fellow workers with the truth. 
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn’t accept what we say. 
For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not satisfied with this, he himself doesn’t receive the brothers and sisters, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church. 
Beloved, don’t imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good belongs to God; the one who does evil hasn’t seen God. 
Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true. 
I had many things to write to you, but I would rather not write them to you with pen and ink; 
but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face. 
Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
