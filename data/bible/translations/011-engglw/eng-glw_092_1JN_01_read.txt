John’s First Letter.
Chapter 1.
We declare to you that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we watched, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life. 
The life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you this eternal life which was with the Father and was revealed to us. 
That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you may also have fellowship with us. Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. 
We write these things to you so that your joy may be full. 
This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. 
If we say that we have fellowship with Him, but walk in darkness, we lie and don’t do what is true. 
But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin. 
If we say that we don’t sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth isn’t in us. 
If we admit to our sins, He is faithful and with righteous justice forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. 
If we claim that we haven’t sinned, we call Him a liar, and His word isn’t in us.
