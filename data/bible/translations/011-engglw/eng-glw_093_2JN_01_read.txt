John’s Second Letter.
Chapter 1.
The Elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I sincerely love in truth - and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth - 
because of the truth which lives in us and will be with us forever: 
Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and sincere love. 
I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have been commanded to do by the Father. 
Now I ask you, dear lady, not as writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we sincerely love one another. 
This is sincere love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. 
For many deceivers have gone out into the world - those who don’t acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
Watch yourselves, that you might not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may get a full reward. 
Anyone who doesn’t live in the teaching of Christ, but runs away from it, doesn’t have God. One who lives in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t welcome or receive that person into your house, 
for the one who welcomes such a person participates in that person’s evil deeds. 
Since I have so many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. 
The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
