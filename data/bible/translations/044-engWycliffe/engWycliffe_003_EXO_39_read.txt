And he made redi twei `stonys of onychyn, boundun and closid in gold, and grauun bi the craft of worchere in iemmys, with the names of the sones of Israel; sixe names in o stoon, and sixe in the tother stoon, bi the ordre of her birthe. 
And he settide tho stoonus in the sidis of the `clooth on the schuldris, in to a memorial of the sones of Israel, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.

Thei maden also cootis of bijs, bi wouun werk, to Aaron and to hise sones,

And thei bounden it with the mytre bi a lace of iacynt, as the Lord comaundide to Moises. 
Therfor al the werk of the tabernacle, and the hilyng of the witnessyng, was parformed; and the sones of Israel diden alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises. 
And thei offeriden the tabernacle, and the roof, and al the purtenaunce, ryngis, tablis, barris, pileris, and foundementis;

And aftir that Moises siy alle tho thingis fillid, he blesside hem.
