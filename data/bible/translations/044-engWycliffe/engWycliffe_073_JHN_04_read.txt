Chapter 4.
Therfor as Jhesu knew, that the Farisees herden, that Jhesu makith and baptisith mo disciplis than Joon, 
thouy Jhesus baptiside not, but hise disciplis, he lefte Judee, 
and wente ayen in to Galilee. 
And it bihofte hym to passe bi Samarie. 
Therfor Jhesus cam in to a citee of Samarie, that is seid Sicar, bisidis the place, that Jacob yaf to Joseph, his sone. 
And the welle of Jacob was there; and Jhesus was weri of the iourney, and sat thus vpon the welle. And the our was, as it were the sixte. 
And a womman cam fro Samarie, to drawe watir. And Jhesus seith to hir, Yyue me drynk. 
And hise disciplis weren gon in to the citee, to bie mete. 
Therfor thilke womman of Samarie seith to him, Hou thou, `whanne thou art a Jewe, axist of me drynk, that am a womman of Samarie? for Jewis vsiden not to dele with Samaritans. 
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hir, If thou wistist the yifte of God, and who `he is, that seith to thee, Yyue me drynk, thou perauenture woldist haue axid of hym, and he schulde haue youun to thee quyk watir. 
The womman seith to him, Sire, thou hast not where ynne to drawe, and the pit is deep; wherof thanne hast thou quik watir? 
Whethir thou art grettere than oure fadir Jacob, that yaf to vs the pit? and he drank therof, and hise sones, and hise beestis. 
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hir, Eche man that drynkith of this watir, schal thirste efte soone; but he that drynkith of the watir that Y schal yyue hym, schal not thirste with outen ende; but the watir that Y schal yyue hym, 
schal be maad in hym a welle `of watir, spryngynge vp in to euerlastynge lijf. 
The womman seith to hym, Sire, yyue me this watir, that Y thirste not, nether come hidur to drawe. 
Jhesus seith to hir, Go, clepe thin hosebonde, and come hidir. 
The womman answerde, and seide, Y haue noon hosebonde. Jhesus seith to hir, Thou seidist wel, That Y haue noon hosebonde; 
for thou hast hadde fyue hosebondis, and he that thou hast, is not thin hosebonde. This thing thou seidist sotheli. 
The womman seith to hym, Lord, Y se, that thou art a prophete. 
Oure fadris worschipiden in this hil, and ye seien, that at Jerusalem is a place, where it bihoueth to worschipe. 
Jhesus seith to hir, Womman, bileue thou to me, for the our schal come, whanne nether in this hil, nethir in Jerusalem, ye schulen worschipe the fadir. 
Ye worschipen that ye knowen not; we worschipen that that we knowen; for helthe is of the Jewis. 
But the tyme is comun, and now it is, whanne trewe worschiperis schulen worschipe the fadir in spirit and treuthe; for also the fadir sekith suche, that worschipen hym. 
God is a spirit, and it bihoueth hem that worschipen hym, to worschipe in spirit and treuthe. 
The womman seith to hym, Y woot that Messias is comun, that is seid Crist; therfor whanne he cometh, he schal telle vs alle thingis. 
Jhesus seith to hir, Y am he, that spekith with thee. 
And anoon hise disciplis camen, and wondriden, that he spak with the womman; netheles no man seide to hym, What sekist thou, or, What spekist thou with hir? 
Therfor the womman lefte hir watir pot, and wente in to the citee, and seide to tho men, 
Come ye, and se ye a man, that seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don; whether he be Crist? 
And thei wenten out of the citee, and camen to hym. 
In the mene while hise disciplis preieden hym, and seiden, Maistir, ete. 
But he seide to hem, Y haue mete to ete, that ye knowen not. 
Therfor disciplis seiden togidir, Whether ony man hath brouyt him mete to ete? 
Jhesus seith to hem, My mete is, that Y do the wille of hym that sente me, that Y perfourme the werk of hym. 
Whether ye seien not, that yit foure monethis ben, and rype corn cometh? Lo! Y seie to you, lifte vp youre iyen, and se ye the feeldis, for now thei ben white to repe. 
And he that repith takith hire, and gaderith fruyt in to euerlastynge lijf; that bothe he that sowith, and he that repith, haue ioye togidere. 
In this thing is the word trewe, for anothir is that sowith, and anothir that repith. 
Y sente you to repe, that that ye `haue not trauelid; `othere men han trauelid, and ye han entrid `in to her trauels. 
And of that citee many Samaritans bileueden in hym, for the word of the womman, that bare witnessyng, That he seide to me alle thingis that Y haue don. 
Therfor whanne Samaritans camen to hym, thei preieden hym to dwelle there; and he dwelte there twey daies. 
And many mo bileueden for his word, 
and seiden to the womman, That now not for thi speche we bileuen; for we han herd, and we witen, that this is verili the sauyour of the world. 
And aftir twei daies he wente out fro thennus, and wente in to Galilee. 
And he bar witnessyng, that a profete in his owne cuntre hath noon onour. 
Therfor whanne he cam in to Galilee, men of Galilee resseyueden hym, whanne thei hadden seyn alle thingis that he hadde don in Jerusalem in the feeste dai; for also thei hadden comun to the feeste dai. 
Therfor he cam eftsoone in to the Cane of Galile, where he made the watir wiyn. And `a litil kyng was, whos sone was sijk at Cafarnaum. 
Whanne this hadde herd, that Jhesu schulde come fro Judee in to Galilee, he wente to hym, and preiede hym, that he schulde come doun, and heele his sone; for he bigan to die. 
Therfor Jhesus seide to him, But ye se tokenes and grete wondris, ye bileuen not. 
The litil kyng seith to hym, Lord, come doun, bifor that my sone die. 
Jhesus seith to hym, Go, thi sone lyueth. The man bileuede to the word, that Jhesus seide to hym, and he wente. 
And now whanne he cam doun, the seruauntis camen ayens hym, and telden to hym, and seiden, That his sone lyuede. 
And he axide of hem the our, in which he was amendid. And thei seiden to hym, For yistirdai in the seuenthe our the feuer lefte him. 
Therfor the fadir knewe, that thilke our it was, in which Jhesus seide to hym, Thi sone lyueth; and he bileuede, and al his hous. 
Jhesus dide eft this secounde tokene, whanne he cam fro Judee in to Galilee.
