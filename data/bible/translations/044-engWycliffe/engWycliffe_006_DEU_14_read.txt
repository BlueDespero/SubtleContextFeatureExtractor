Be ye the sones of youre Lord God; ye schulen not kitte you, nether ye schulen make ballidnesse, 
on a deed man, for thou art an hooli puple to thi Lord God, and he chees thee that thou be to hym in to a special puple, of alle folkis that ben on erthe. 
Ete ye not tho thingis that ben vncleene. 
This is a beeste which ye schulen ete; an oxe, and a scheep, and a goet, an hert, 
a capret, a `wielde oxe, tregelafun, `that is, a beeste in parti lijk `a buk of geet, and in parti liik an hert, a figarde, an ostrich, a camelioun, `that is, a beeste lijk in the heed to a camel, and hath white spottis in the bodi as a parde, and `is lijk an hors in the necke, and in the feet is lijc a `wilde oxe, and a parde. 
Ye schulen ete ech beeste that departith the clee `in to twei partis, and chewith code. 
Sotheli ye schulen not ete these beestis, of these that chewen code, and departen not the clee; a camel, an hare, and a cirogrille, `that is, a beeste ful of prickis, and is more than an irchoun; for tho chewen code, and departen not the clee, tho schulen be vncleene to you;

Ye schulen ete these thingis, of alle that dwellen in watris; ete ye tho thingis that han fynnes and scalis; 
ete ye not tho thingis that ben with out fynnes and scalis, for tho ben vncleene. 
Ete ye alle clene briddis;

and an aliete, ixon, `that is, a whijt brid lesse than a vultur, and is of the `kynde of vultris, and a vultur, and a kite bi his kynde, 
and al thing of rauenys kynde, 
and a strucioun, and a nyyt crowe, and a lare, 
and an hauk bi his kynde, a fawcun, 
and a swan, and a siconye, and a dippere, a pursirioun, and a reremous, a cormeraunt, 
and a caladrie, alle in her kynde; also a lapwynke and a backe. 
And al thing that crepith, and hath fynnes, schal be vncleene, and schal not be etun. 
Ete ye al thing that is cleene; sotheli what euer thing is deed bi it silf, ete ye not therof. 
Yyue thou to the pilgrym which is with ynne thi yatis, that he ete, ether sille thou to hym, for thou art the hooli puple of thi Lord God. Thou schalt not sethe a kyde in `the mylk of his modir. 
Thou schalt departe the tenthe part of alle thi fruytis that comen forth in the lond bi ech yeer; 
and thou schal ete in the siyt of thi Lord God, in the place which he chees, that his name be clepid therynne; thou schalt offre the tithe of thi wheete, wyn, and oile, and the firste gendryd thingis of thi droues, and scheep, that thou lerne to drede thi Lord God in al tyme. 
Sotheli whanne the wei is lengere, and the place which thi Lord God chees is fer, and he hath blessid thee, and thou maist not bere alle these thingis to that place, 
thou schalt sille alle thingis, and schalt turne in to prijs, and thou schalt bere in thin hond, and thou schalt go to the place which thi Lord God chees; 
and thou schalt bie of the same money what euer thing plesith to thee, ethir of droues, ether of scheep; also thou schalt bie wyn, and sidur, and al thing that thi soule desirith; and thou schalt ete bifor thi Lord God, and thou schalt make feeste, 
thou, and thin hows, and the dekene which is withynne thi yatis; be thou war lest thou forsake hym, for he hath not other part in possessioun. 
In the thridde yeer thou schalt departe another dyme of alle thingis that growen to thee in that yeer, and thou schalt kepe withynne thi yatis. 
And the dekene schal come, whych hath noon other part nether possessioun with thee, and the pilgrym, and the fadirles, ether modirles child, and widue, that ben withynne thi yatis, `schulen come, and schulen ete, and be fillid, that thi Lord God blesse thee, in alle werkis of thin hondis whiche thou schalt do.
