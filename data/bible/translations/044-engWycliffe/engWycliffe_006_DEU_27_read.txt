Chapter 27.
Forsothe Moyses comaundide, and the eldre men, to the puple of Israel, and seiden, Kepe ye ech `comaundement which Y comaunde to you to dai. 
And whanne ye han passid Jordan, in to the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, thou schalt reyse grete stoonus, and thou schalt make tho pleyn with chalk, 
that thou mow write in tho alle the wordis of this lawe, whanne Jordan is passid, that thou entre in to the lond which thi Lord God schal yyue to thee, the lond flowynge with mylke and hony, as he swoor to thi fadris. 
Therfor whanne thou hast passid Jordan, reise thou the stonus whiche Y comaunde to dai to thee, in the hil of Hebal; and thou schalt make tho pleyn with chalk. 
And there thou schalt bilde an auter to thi Lord God, of stoonys whiche yrun touchide not, 
and of stonys vnformed and vnpolischid; and thou schalt offre theron brent sacrifices to thi Lord God; and thou schalt offre pesible sacrifices, 
and thou schalt ete there, and thou schalt make feeste bifor thi Lord God. 
And thou schalt write pleynli and clereli on the stoonys alle the wordis of this lawe. 
And Moises and the preestis of the kynde of Leuy seiden to al Israel, Israel, perseyue thou, and here; to day thou art maad the puple of thi Lord God; 
thou schalt here his vois, and thou schalt do `the comaundementis, and riytfulnessis, whiche Y comaunde to thee to dai. 
And Moises comaundide to the puple in that day, 
and seide, These men schulen stonde on the hil of Garizym to blesse the Lord, whanne Jordan `is passid; Symeon, Leuy, Judas, Isachar, Joseph, and Benjamyn. 
And euene ayens these men schulen stonde in the hil of Hebal to curse, Ruben, Gad, and Aser, Zabulon, Dan, and Neptalym. 
And the dekenes schulen pronounce, and schulen seie `with hiy vois to alle the men of Israel, 
Cursid is the man that makith a grauun ymage and yotun togidere, abhomynacioun of the Lord, the werk of `hondis of crafti men, and schal sette it in priuey place; and al the puple schal answere, and schal seie, Amen!
