Exodus.
Chapter 14.
Forsothe the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel; 
turne thei ayen, and sette thei tentis euene ayens Fiayroth, which is bitwixe Magdalum and the see, ayens Beelsefon; in the siyt therof ye schulen sette tentis ouer the see. 
And Farao schal seie on the sones of Israel, Thei ben maad streit in the lond, the deseert hath closid hem to gidere. 
And Y schal make hard his herte, and he schal pursue you, and Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in al his oost; and Egipcians schulen wite that Y am the Lord; and thei diden so. 
And it was teld to the kyng of Egipcians, that the puple hadde fled; and the herte of Farao and of hise seruauntis was chaungid on the puple, and thei seiden, What wolden we do, that we leften Israel, that it schulde not serue us? 
Therfor Farao ioynede the chare, and took with him al his puple; 
and he took sixe hundrid chosyn charis, and what euer thing of charis was in Egipt, and duykis of al the oost. 
And the Lord made hard `the herte of Farao, kyng of Egipt, and he pursuede the sones of Israel; and thei weren go out in an hiy hond. 
And whanne Egipcians pursueden the steppis of the sones of Israel bifor goynge, thei founden hem in tentis on the see; al the chyualrye and charis of Farao, and al the oost weren in Fiayroth, ayens Beelsefon. 
And whanne Farao hadde neiyed the sones of Israel, reisiden her iyen, and thei sien Egipcians bihynde hem, and dredden greetli; and thei crieden to the Lord, 
and seiden to Moises, In hap sepulcris weren not in Egipt, therfor thou hast take vs awei, that we schulen die in wildirnesse? what woldist thou do this, that thou leddist vs out of Egipt? 
Whether this is not the word which we spaken to thee in Egipt, `and seiden, Go awei fro vs, that we serue Egipcians? for it is myche betere to serue hem, than to die in wildirnesse. 
And Moises seide to the puple, Nyle ye drede, stonde ye, and `se ye the grete werkys of God, whiche he schal do to dai; for ye schulen no more se Egipcians, whiche ye seen now, til in to with outen ende; 
the Lord schal fiyte for you, and ye schulen be stille. 
And the Lord seide to Moises, What criest thou to me? Speke thou to the sones of Israel, that thei go forth; forsothe reise thou thi yerde, 
and stretche forth thin hond on the see, and departe thou it, that the sones of Israel go in the myddis of the see, by drie place. 
Forsothe Y schal make hard the herte of Egipcians, that thei pursue you, and Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in al the oost of hym, and in the charis, and in the knyytis of hym; 
and Egipcians schulen wite that Y am the Lord God, whanne Y schal be glorified in Farao, and in the charis, and in the knyytis of hym. 
And the aungel of the Lord, that yede bifore the castellis of Israel, took hym silf, and yede bihynde hem; and the piler of cloude yede to gidir with hym, and lefte the formere thingis aftir the bak, 
and stood bitwixe the `castels of Egipcians and castels of Israel; and the cloude was derk toward Egipcians, and liytnynge `the nyyt toward `the children of Israel, so that in al the tyme of the niyt thei miyten not neiy togidere to hem silf. 
And whanne Moises hadde stretchid forth the hond on the see, the Lord took it awei, the while a greet wynde and brennynge blew in al the niyt, and turnede in to dryenesse; and the watir was departid. 
And the sones of Israel entriden by the myddis of the drye see; for the watir was as a wal at the riyt side and left side of hem. 
And Egipcians pursueden, and entriden aftir hem, al the ridyng of Farao, hise charis, and knyytis, bi the myddis of the see. 
And the wakyng of the morewtid cam thanne, and lo! the Lord bihelde on the castels of Egipcians, bi a piler of fier, and of cloude, and killide the oost of hem; and he destriede the wheelis of charis, 
and tho weren borun in to the depthe. Therfor Egipcians seiden, Fle we Israel; for the Lord fiytith for hem ayenus vs. 
And the Lord seide to Moises, Holde forth thin hond on the see, that the watris turne ayen to Egipcians, on the charis, and knyytis of hem. 
And whanne Moises hadde hold forth the hoond ayens the see, it turnede ayen first in the morewtid to the formere place; and whanne Egipcians fledden, the watris camen ayen, and the Lord wlappide hem in the myddis of the floodis. 
And the watris turneden ayen, and hiliden the charis, and knyytis of al the oost of Farao, which sueden, and entriden in to the see; sotheli not oon of hem was alyue. 
Forsothe the sones of Israel yeden thorouy the myddis of the drye see, and the watris weren to hem as for a wal, on the riyt side and left side. 
And in that dai the Lord delyuerede Israel fro the hond of Egipcians, and thei sien Egipcians deed on the brynke of the see, 
and thei seiyen the greet hond which the Lord hadde vsid ayens hem; and the puple dredde the Lord, and thei bileueden to the Lord, and to Moises his seruaunt.
