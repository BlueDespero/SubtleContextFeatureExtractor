Chapter 15.
Y am a very vyne, and my fadir is an erthe tilier. 
Ech braunch in me that berith not fruyt, he schal take awey it; and ech that berith fruyt, he schal purge it, that it bere the more fruyt. 
Now ye ben clene, for the word that Y haue spokun to you. 
Dwelle ye in me, and Y in you; as a braunche may not make fruyt of it silf, but it dwelle in the vyne, so nether ye, but ye dwelle in me. 
Y am a vyne, ye the braunchis. Who that dwellith in me, and Y in hym, this berith myche fruyt, for with outen me ye moun no thing do. 
If ony man dwellith not in me, he schal be caste out as a braunche, and schal wexe drie; and thei schulen gadere hym, and thei schulen caste hym in to the fier, and he brenneth. 
If ye dwellen in me, and my wordis dwelle in you, what euer thing ye wolen, ye schulen axe, and it schal be don to you. 
In this thing my fadir is clarified, that ye brynge forth ful myche fruyt, and that ye be maad my disciplis. 
As my fadir louede me, Y haue loued you; dwelle ye in my loue. 
If ye kepen my comaundementis, ye schulen dwelle in my loue; as Y haue kept the comaundementis of my fadir, and Y dwelle in his loue. 
These thingis Y spak to you, that my ioye be in you, and youre ioye be fulfillid. 
This is my comaundement, that ye loue togidere, as Y louede you. 
No man hath more loue than this, that a man putte his lijf for hise freendis. 
Ye ben my freendis if ye doen tho thingis, that Y comaunde to you. 
Now Y schal not clepe you seruauntis, for the seruaunt woot not, what his lord schal do; but Y haue clepid you freendis, for alle thingis what euere Y herde of my fadir, Y haue maad knowun to you. 
Ye han not chosun me, but Y chees you; and Y haue put you, that ye go, and brynge forth fruyt, and youre fruyt dwelle; that what euere thing ye axen the fadir in my name, he yyue to you. 
These thingis Y comaunde to you, that ye loue togidere. 
If the world hatith you, wite ye, that it hadde me in hate rather than you. 
If ye hadden be of the world, the world schulde loue that thing that was his; but for ye ben not of the world, but Y chees you fro the world, therfor the world hatith you. 
Haue ye mynde of my word, which Y seide to you, The seruaunt is not grettere than his lord. If thei han pursued me, thei schulen pursue you also; if thei han kept my word, thei schulen kepe youre also. 
But thei schulen do to you alle these thingis for my name, for thei knowen not hym that sente me. 
If Y hadde not comun, and hadde not spokun to hem, thei schulden not haue synne; but now thei haue noon excusacioun of her synne. 
He that hatith me, hatith also my fadir. 
If Y hadde not doon werkis in hem, whiche noon other man dide, thei schulden not haue synne; but now both thei han seyn, and hatid me and my fadir. 
But that the word be fulfillid, that is writun in her lawe, For thei hadden me in hate with outen cause. 
But whanne the coumfortour schal come, which Y schal sende to you fro the fadir, a spirit of treuthe, which cometh of the fadir, he schal bere witnessyng of me; 
and ye schulen bere witnessyng, for ye ben with me fro the bigynnyng.
