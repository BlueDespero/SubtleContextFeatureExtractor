Matthew.
Chapter 19.
And it was don, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis, he passide fro Galilee, and cam in to the coostis of Judee ouer Jordan. 
And myche puple suede him, and he heelide hem there. 
And Farisees camen to him, temptynge him, and seiden, Whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf, for ony cause? 
Which answeride, and seide to hem, Han ye not red, for he that made men at the bigynnyng, made hem male and female? 
And he seide, For this thing a man schal leeue fadir and modir, and he schal draw to his wijf; and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch. 
And so thei ben not now tweyne, but o fleisch. Therfor a man departe not that thing that God hath ioyned. 
Thei seien to hym, What thanne comaundide Moises, to yyue a libel of forsakyng, and to leeue of? 
And he seide to hem, For Moises, for the hardnesse of youre herte, suffride you leeue youre wyues; but fro the bigynnyng it was not so. 
And Y seie to you, that who euer leeueth his wijf, but for fornycacioun, and weddith another, doith letcherie; and he that weddith the forsakun wijf, doith letcherie. 
His disciplis seien to him, If the cause of a man with a wijf is so, it spedith not to be weddid. 
And he seide to hem, Not alle men taken this word; but to whiche it is youun. 
For ther ben geldingis, whiche ben thus born of the modris wombe; and ther ben geldyngis, that ben maad of men; and there ben geldyngis, that han geldid hem silf, for the kyngdom of heuenes. He that may take, `take he. 
Thanne litle children weren brouyte to hym, that he schulde putte hondis to hem, and preie. 
And the disciplis blamyden hem. But Jhesus seide to hem, Suffre ye that litle children come to me, and nyle ye forbede hem; for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes. 
And whanne he hadde put to hem hondis, he wente fro thennus. 
And lo! oon cam, and seide to hym, Good maister, what good schal Y do, that Y haue euerlastynge lijf? 
Which seith to hym, What axist thou me of good thing? There is o good God. But if thou wolt entre to lijf, kepe the comaundementis. 
He seith to hym, Whiche? And Jhesus seide, Thou schalt not do mansleying, thou schalt not do auowtrie, thou schalt not do thefte, thou schalt not seie fals witnessying; 
worschipe thi fadir and thi modir, and, thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf. 
The yonge man seith to hym, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my youthe, what yit failith to me? 
Jhesus seith to hym, If thou wolt be perfite, go, and sille alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene; and come, and sue me. 
And whanne the yong man hadde herd these wordis, he wente awei sorewful, for he hadde many possessiouns. 
And Jhesus seide to hise disciplis, Y seie to you treuthe, for a riche man of hard schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes. 
And eftsoone Y seie to you, it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a needlis iye, thanne a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of heuens. 
Whanne these thingis weren herd, the disciplis wondriden greetli, and seiden, Who thanne may be saaf? 
Jhesus bihelde, and seide to hem, Anentis men this thing is impossible; but anentis God alle thingis ben possible. 
Thanne Petre answeride, and seide to hym, Lo! we han forsake alle thingis, and we han suede thee; what thanne schal be to vs? 
Jhesus seide to hem, Truli I seie to you, that ye that han forsake alle thingis, and han sued me, in the regeneracioun whanne mannus sone schal sitte in the sete of his maieste, ye schulen sitte on twelue setis, demynge the twelue kynredis of Israel. 
And euery man that forsakith hous, britheren or sistren, fadir or modir, wijf ethir children, or feeldis, for my name, he schal take an hundrid foold, and schal welde euerlastynge lijf. 
But manye schulen be, the firste the laste, and the laste the firste.
