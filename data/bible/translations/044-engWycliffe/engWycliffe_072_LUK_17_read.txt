Luke.
Chapter 17.
And Jhesu seide to hise disciplis, It is impossible that sclaundris come not; but wo to that man, bi whom thei comen. 
It is more profitable to him, if a mylne stoon be put aboute his necke, and he be cast in to the see, than that he sclaundre oon of these litle. 
Take ye hede you silf; if thi brothir hath synned ayens thee, blame hym; and if he do penaunce, foryyue hym. 
And if seuene sithis in the dai he do synne ayens thee, and seuene sithis in the dai he be conuertid to thee, and seie, It forthenkith me, foryyue thou hym. 
And the apostlis seiden to the Lord, Encrese to vs feith. 
And the Lord seide, If ye han feith as the corn of seneuei, ye schulen seie to this more tre, Be thou drawun vp bi the rote, and be ouerplauntid in to the see, and it schal obeie to you. 
But who of you hath a seruaunt erynge, or lesewynge oxis, which seith to hym, whanne he turneth ayen fro the feeld, Anoon go, and sitte to mete; 
and seith not to hym, Make redi, that Y soupe, and girde thee, and serue me, while Y ete and drynke, and aftir this thou schalt ete and drynke; 
whether he hath grace to that seruaunt, for he dide that that he comaundide hym? 
Nay, Y gesse. So ye, whanne ye han don alle thingis that ben comaundid to you, seie ye, We ben vnprofitable seruauntis, we han do that that we ouyten to do. 
And it was do, the while Jhesus wente in to Jerusalem, he passide thorou the myddis of Samarie, and Galilee. 
And whanne he entride in to a castel, ten leprouse men camen ayens hym, whiche stoden afer, 
and reiseden her voys, and seiden, Jhesu, comaundoure, haue merci on vs. 
And as he say hem, he seide, Go ye, `schewe ye you to the prestis. And it was don, the while thei wenten, thei weren clensid. 
And oon of hem, as he saiy that he was clensid, wente ayen, magnifiynge God with grete vois. 
And he fel doun on the face bifore hise feet, and dide thankyngis; and this was a Samaritan. 
And Jhesus answerde, and seide, Whether ten ben not clensid, and where ben the nyne? 
There is noon foundun, that turnede ayen, and yaf glorie to God, but this alien. 
And he seide to hym, Rise vp, go thou; for thi feith hath maad thee saaf. 
And he was axid of Farisees, whanne the rewme of God cometh. And he answerde to hem, and seide, The rewme of God cometh not with aspiyng, 
nether thei schulen seie, Lo! here, or lo there; for lo! the rewme of God is with ynne you. 
And he seide to hise disciplis, Daies schulen come, whanne ye schulen desire to se o dai of mannus sone, and ye schulen not se. 
And thei schulen seie to you, Lo! here, and lo there. Nyle ye go, nether sue ye; 
for as leyt schynynge from vndur heuene schyneth in to tho thingis that ben vndur heuene, so schal mannus sone be in his dai. 
But first it bihoueth hym to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of this generacioun. 
And as it was doon in the daies of Noe, so it schal be in the daies of mannys sone. 
Thei eeten and drunkun, weddiden wyues, and weren youun to weddyngis, til in to the dai in the whych Noe entride in to the schip; and the greet flood cam, and loste alle. 
Also as it was don in the daies of Loth, thei eeten and drunkun, bouyten and seelden, plauntiden and bildiden; but the dai that Loth wente out of Sodome, 
the Lord reynede fier and brymstoon fro heuene, and loste alle. 
Lijk this thing it schal be, in what dai mannys sone schal be schewid. 
In that our he that is in the roof, and his vessels in the hous, come he not doun to take hem awei; and he that schal be in the feeld, also turne not ayen bihynde. 
Be ye myndeful of the wijf of Loth. 
Who euer seketh to make his lijf saaf, schal leese it; and who euer leesith it, schal quykene it. 
But Y seie to you, in that nyyt twei schulen be in o bed, oon schal be takun, and the tothir forsakun; 
twei wymmen schulen be gryndynge togidir, `the toon schal be takun, and `the tother forsakun; twei in a feeld, `the toon schal be takun, and `the tother left. 
Thei answeren, and seien to hym, Where, Lord? 
Which seide to hym, Where euer the bodi schal be, thidur schulen be gaderid togidere also the eglis.
