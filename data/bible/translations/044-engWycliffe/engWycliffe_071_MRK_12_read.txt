Chapter 12.
And Jhesus bigan to speke to hem in parablis. A man plauntide a vynyerd, and sette an hegge aboute it, and dalf a lake, and bildide a toure, and hiryde it to tilieris, and wente forth in pilgrimage. 
And he sente to the erthe tilieris in tyme a seruaunt, to resseyue of the erthe tilieris of the fruyt of the vynyerd. 
And thei token hym, and beeten, and leften hym voide. 
And eftsoone he sente to hem anothir seruaunt, and thei woundiden hym in the heed, and turmentiden hym. 
And eftsoone he sente another, and thei slowen hym, and othir mo, betynge summe, and sleynge othere. 
But yit he hadde a moost derworth sone, and he sente hym last to hem, and seide, Perauenture thei schulen drede my sone. 
But the erthetilieris seiden togidere, This is the eire; come ye, sle we hym, and the eritage schal be ourun. 
And thei tokun hym, and killiden, and castiden out without the vynyerd. 
Thanne what schal the lord of the vynyerd do? He schal come, and lese the tilieris, and yyue the vynyerd to othere. 
Whether ye han not red this scripture, The stoon which the bilderis han disspisid, this is maad in to the heed of the corner? 
This thing is doon of the Lord, and is wondirful in oure iyen. 
And thei souyten to holde hym, and thei dredden the puple; for thei knewen that to hem he seide this parable; and thei leften hym, 
and thei wenten awei. And thei senten to hym summe of the Farisees and Erodians, to take hym in word. 
Whiche camen, and seien to hym, Maistir, we witen that thou art sothfast, and reckist not of ony man; for nethir thou biholdist in to the face of man, but thou techist the weie of God in treuthe. Is it leeueful that tribute be youun to the emperoure, or we schulen not yyue? 
Which witynge her pryuei falsnesse, seide to hem, What tempten ye me? brynge ye to me a peny, that Y se. 
And thei brouyten to hym. And he seide to hem, Whos is this ymage, and the writyng? Thei seien to him, The emperouris. 
And Jhesus answeride and seide to hem, Thanne yelde ye to the emperour tho thingis that ben of the emperours; and to God tho thingis that ben of God. 
And thei wondriden of hym. And Saduces, that seien that ther is no ressurreccioun, camen to hym, and axeden hym, 
and seiden, Maister, Moyses wroot to vs, that if the brother of a man were deed, and lefte his wijf, and haue no sones, his brother take his wijf, and reise vp seed to his brother. 
Thanne seuene britheren ther weren; and the firste took a wijf, and diede, and lefte no seed. 
And the secounde took hir, and he diede, and nether this lefte seed. 
And the thridde also. And in lijk manere the seuene token hir, and leften not seed. And the womman the laste of alle `is deed. 
Thanne in the resurreccioun, whanne thei schulen rise ayen, whos wijf of these schal sche be? for seuene hadden hir to wijf. 
And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hem, Whether ye erren not therfor, that ye knowe not scripturis, nethir the vertu of God? 
For whanne thei schulen rise ayen fro deeth, nether thei schulen wedde, nethir schulen be weddid, but thei schulen be as aungels of God in heuenes. 
And of deed men, that thei risen ayen, han ye not red in the book of Moises, on the buysch, hou God spak to hym, and seide, Y am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? 
He is not God of deed men, but of lyuynge men; therfor ye erren myche. 
And oon of the scribis, that hadde herde hem dispuytynge togidir, cam nyy, and saiy that Jhesus had wel answeride hem, and axide hym, which was the firste maundement of alle. 
And Jhesus answeride to him, that the firste maundement of alle is, Here thou, Israel, thi Lord God is o God; 
and thou schalt loue thi Lord God of al thin herte, and of al thi soule, and of al thi mynde, and of al thi myyt. 
This is the firste maundement. And the secounde is lijk to this, Thou schalt loue thi neiybore as thi silf. Ther is noon other maundement gretter than these. 
And the scribe seide to hym, Maister, in treuthe thou hast wel seid; for o God is, and ther is noon other, outakun hym; 
that he be loued of al the herte, and of al the mynde, and of al the vndurstondynge, and of al the soule, and of al strengthe, and to loue the neiybore as hym silf, is gretter than alle brent offryngis and sacrifices. 
And Jhesus seynge that he hadde answerid wiseli, seide to hym, Thou art not fer fro the kyngdom of God. 
And thanne no man durste axe hym no more ony thing. And Jhesus answeride and seide, techynge in the temple, Hou seien scribis, that Crist is the sone of Dauid? 
For Dauid hym silf seide in the Hooli Goost, the Lord seide to my lord, Sitte on my riythalf, til Y putte thin enemyes the stool of thi feet. 
Thanne Dauid hym silf clepith him lord, hou thanne is he his sone? And myche puple gladli herde hym. 
And he seide to hem in his techyng, Be ye war of scribis, that wolen wandre in stolis, 
and be salutid in chepyng, and sitte in synagogis in the firste chaieris, and the firste sittyng placis in soperis; 
whiche deuouren the housis of widewis vndur colour of long preier; thei schulen take the longer doom. 
And Jhesus sittynge ayens the tresorie, bihelde hou the puple castide monei in to the tresorie; and many riche men castiden many thingis. 
But whanne a pore widewe was comun, sche keste two mynutis, that is, a ferthing. 
And he clepide togidere hise disciplis, and seide to hem, Treuli Y seie to you, that this pore widewe keste more thanne alle, that kesten in to the tresorie. 
For alle kesten of that thing that thei hadden plente of; but this of her pouert keste alle thingis that sche hadde, al hir lyuelode.
