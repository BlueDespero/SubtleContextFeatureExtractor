Leviticus.
Chapter 15.
And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron, `and seide, 
Speke ye to the sones of Israel, and seie ye to hem, A man that suffrith the rennyng out of seed, schal be vncleene; 
and thanne he schal be demed to be suget to this vice, whanne bi alle momentis foul vmour `ethir moysture cleueth to his fleisch, and growith togidere. 
Ech bed in which he slepith schal be vncleene, and where euer he sittith. 
If ony man touchith his bed, he schal waische his clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
If a man sittith where he satt, also thilke man schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vnclene `til to euentid. 
He that touchith hise fleischis, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
If sich a man castith out spetyng on hym that is cleene, he schal waische his clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
The sadil on which he sittith, 
schal be vncleene; and ech man that touchith what euer thing is vndur hym that suffrith the fletyng out of seed, schal be defoulid `til to euentid. He that berith ony of these thingis, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
Ech man, whom he that is such touchith with hondis not waischun bifore, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
`A vessel of erthe which he touchith, schal be brokun; but a `vessel of tre schal be waischun in watir. 
If he that suffrith sich a passioun, is heelid, he schal noumbre seuene daies aftir his clensyng, and whanne the clothis and al `the bodi ben waischun in lyuynge watris, he schal be clene. 
Forsothe in the eiytthe dai he schal take twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of a culuer, and he schal come in the `siyt of the Lord at the dore of tabernacle of witnessyng, and schal yyue tho to the preest; 
and the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preye for hym bifor the Lord, that he be clensid fro the fletyng out of his seed. 
A man fro whom the seed of letcherie, `ethir of fleischli couplyng, goith out, schal waische in watir al his bodi, and he schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
He schal waische in watir the cloth `and skyn which he hath, and it schal be unclene `til to euentid. 
The womman with which he `is couplid fleischli, schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
A womman that suffrith the fletyng out of blood, whanne the moneth cometh ayen, schal be departid bi seuene daies; ech man that touchith hir schal be vncleene `til to euentid, 
and the place in which sche slepith ether sittith in the daies of hir departyng, schal be defoulid. 
He that touchith her bed, schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
Who euer touchith ony vessel on which sche sittith, he schal waische hise clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be defoulid `til to euentid. 
If a man is couplid fleischli with hir in the tyme of blood that renneth bi monethis, he schal be vncleene bi seuene daies, and ech bed in which he slepith schal be defoulid. 
A womman that suffrith in many daies the `fletyng out of blood, not in the tyme of monethis, ethir which womman ceessith not to flete out blood aftir the blood of monethis, schal be vncleene as longe as sche `schal be suget to this passioun, as if sche is in the tyme of monethis. 
Ech bed in which sche slepith, and `vessel in which sche sittith, schal be defoulid. 
Who euer touchith hir schal waische his clothis, and he schal be waischun in watir, and schal be vncleene `til to euentid. 
If the blood stondith, and ceessith to flete out, sche schal noumbre seuene daies of hir clensyng, 
and in the eiytthe dai sche schal offre for hir silf to the preest twei turtlis, ethir twei `briddis of culueris, at the dore of the tabernacle of witnessyng; 
and the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preye for hir bifor the Lord, and for the fletyng out of hir vnclennesse. 
Therfor ye schulen teche the sones of Israel, that thei eschewe vnclennessis, and that thei die not for her filthis, whanne thei defoulen my tabernacle which is among hem. 
This is the lawe of hym that suffrith fletyng out of seed, and which is defoulid with fleischly couplyng, 
and of a womman which is departid in the tymes of monethis, ethir which flowith out in contynuel blood, and of the man that slepith with hir.
