Chapter 15.
And anoon in the morewtid the hiyeste prestis maden a counsel with the elder men, and the scribis, and with al the counsel, and bounden Jhesu and ledden, and bitoken hym to Pilat. 
And Pilat axide hym, Art thou kynge of Jewis? And Jhesus answeride, and seide to hym, Thou seist. 
And the hieste prestis accusiden hym in many thingis. 
But Pilat eftsoone axide hym, and seide, Answerist thou no thing? Seest thou in hou many thingis thei accusen thee? 
But Jhesus answeride no more, so that Pilat wondride. 
But bi the feeste dai he was wont to leeue to hem oon of men boundun, whom euer thei axiden. 
And `oon ther was that was seid Barabas, that was boundun with men of dissencioun, that hadden don manslauytir in seducioun. 
And whanne the puple was gon vp, he bigan to preie, as he euer more dide to hem. 
And Pilat answeride `to hem, and seide, Wolen ye Y leeue to you the kyng of Jewis? 
For he wiste, that the hiyeste prestis hadden takun hym bi enuye. 
But the bischopis stireden the puple, that he schulde rather leeue to hem Barabas. 
And eftsoone Pilat answerde, and seide to hem, What thanne wolen ye that Y schal do to the kyng of Jewis? 
And thei eftsoone crieden, Crucifie hym. 
But Pilat seide to hem, What yuel hath he don? And thei crieden the more, Crucifie hym. 
And Pilat, willynge to make aseeth to the puple, lefte to hem Barabas, and bitok to hem Jhesu, betun with scourgis, to be crucified. 
And knyytis ledden hym with ynneforth, in to the porche of the mote halle. And thei clepiden togidir al the cumpany of knyytis, 
and clothiden hym with purpur. And thei writhen a coroun of thornes, and puttiden on hym. 
And thei bigunnen to grete hym, and seiden, Heile, thou kyng of Jewis. 
And thei smyten his heed with a reed, and bispatten hym; and thei kneliden, and worschipiden hym. 
And aftir that thei hadden scorned him, thei vnclothiden hym of purpur, and clothiden hym with hise clothis, and ledden out hym, to crucifie hym. 
And thei compelliden a man that passide the weie, that cam fro the toun, Symount of Syrenen, the fader of Alisaundir and of Rufe, to bere his cross. 
And thei ledden hym in to a place Golgatha, that is to seie, the place of Caluari. 
And thei yauen to hym to drynke wyn meddlid with mirre, and he took not. 
And thei crucifieden him, and departiden hise clothis, and kesten lot on tho, who schulde take what. 
And it was the thridde our, and thei crucifieden hym. 
And the titil of his cause was writun, Kyng of Jewis. 
And thei crucifien with hym twei theues, oon `at the riythalf and oon at his lefthalf. 
And the scripture was fulfillid that seith, And he is ordeyned with wickid men. 
And as thei passiden forth, thei blasfemyden hym, mouynge her heedis, and seiynge, Vath! thou that distriest the temple of God, and in `thre daies bildist it ayen; 
come adoun fro the crosse, and make thi silf saaf. 
Also the hiyeste prestis scorneden hym ech to othir with the scribis, and seiden, He made othir men saaf, he may not saue hym silf. 
Crist, kyng of Israel, come doun now fro the cross, that we seen, and bileuen. And thei that weren crucified with hym, dispiseden hym. 
And whanne the sixte hour was come, derknessis weren made on al the erthe til in to the nynthe our. 
And in the nynthe our Jhesus criede with a greet vois, and seide, Heloy, Heloy, lamasabatany, that is to seie, My God, my God, whi hast thou forsakun me? 
And summe of men that stoden aboute herden, and seiden, Lo! he clepith Helye. 
And oon ranne, and fillide a spounge with vynegre, and puttide aboute to a reede, and yaf to hym drynke, and seide, Suffre ye, se we, if Helie come to do hym doun. 
And Jhesus yaf out a greet cry, and diede. 
And the veil of the temple was rent atwo fro the hiyeste to bynethe. 
But the centurien that stood forn ayens siy, that he so criynge hadde diede, and seide, Verili, this man was Goddis sone. 
And ther weren also wymmen biholdynge fro afer, among whiche was Marie Maudeleyn, and Marie, the modir of James the lesse, and of Joseph, and of Salome. 
And whanne Jhesus was in Galilee, thei folewiden hym, and mynystriden to hym, and many othere wymmen, that camen vp togidir with him to Jerusalem. 
And whanne euentid was come, for it was the euentid which is bifor the sabat, 
Joseph of Armathie, the noble decurioun, cam, and he abood the rewme of God; and booldli he entride to Pilat, and axide the bodi of Jhesu. 
But Pilat wondride, if he were now deed. 
And whanne the centurion was clepid, he axide hym, if he were deed; and whanne he knewe of the centurion, he grauntide the bodi of Jhesu to Joseph. 
And Joseph bouyte lynnen cloth, and took hym doun, and wlappide in the lynnen cloth, and leide hym in a sepulcre that was hewun of a stoon, and walewide a stoon to the dore of the sepulcre. 
And Marie Maudeleyne and Marie of Joseph bihelden, where he was leid.
