Zechariah.
Chapter 5.
Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll. 
He said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide.” 
Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath shall be banished according to the writing on the other side. 
I have sent it out, says the Lord of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.” 
Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Look up and see what is now coming.” 
I said. “What is it?” He said, “It is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.” 
A round leaden cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the basket. 
He said, “This is Wickedness.” He thrust her down into the midst of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth. 
Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between them. 
Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?” 
He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.”
