Psalms.
Chapter 47.
For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. Clap your hands, all you peoples: shout to God in ringing cries. 
For the Lord is most high and dread, a great king over all the earth. 
He subdues the peoples under us, the nations under our feet; 
he chooses our heritage for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loves. Selah 
God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. 
Sing praise to our God, sing praises: sing praise to our king, sing praises. 
For king of all earth is he: praise God in a skilful song. 
God is king over all the nations, God sits on his holy throne. 
Princes of nations gather with the people of Abraham's God: for the shields of the earth are God's; greatly exalted is he.
