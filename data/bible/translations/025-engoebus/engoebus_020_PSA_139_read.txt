Psalms.
Chapter 139.
For the leader. Of David, a psalm. O Lord, you search and know me; 
when I sit, when I rise you know it, you perceive my thoughts from afar. 
When I walk, when I lie you sift it, familiar with all my ways. 
There is not a word on my tongue, but see! Lord, you know it all. 
Behind and before you beset me, upon me you lay your hand. 
It's too wonderful for me to know too lofty I cannot attain it. 
Whither shall I go from your spirit? Or whither shall I flee from your face? 
If I climb up to heaven, you are there: or make Sheol my bed, you are there. 
If I lift up the wings of the morning and fly to the end of the sea, 
there also your hand would grasp me, and your right hand take hold of me. 
If I say, “Let the darkness cover me, and night be the light about me,” 
The dark is not dark for you, but night is as light as the day. 
For you did put me together; in my mother's womb you did weave me. 
I give you praise for my fashioning so full of awe, so wonderful. Your works are wonderful. You knew me right well; 
my bones were not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, and woven in the depths of the earth. 
Your eyes saw all my days: they stood on your book every one written down, before they were fashioned, while none of them yet was mine. 
But how far, O God, beyond measure are your thoughts! How mighty their sum! 
Should I count, they are more than the sand. When I wake, I am still with you. 
Will you slay the wicked, O God? And remove from me the bloodthirsty, 
who maliciously defy you and take your name in vain. 
Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord? Do I not loathe those who resist you? 
With perfect hatred I hate them, I count them my enemies. 
Search me, O God, know my heart: test me, and know my thoughts, 
and see if guile be in me; and lead me in the way everlasting.
