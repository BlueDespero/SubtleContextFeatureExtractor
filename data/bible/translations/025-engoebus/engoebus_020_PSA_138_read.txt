Psalms.
Chapter 138.
Of David. I will thank you, O Lord, with all my heart: in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise, 
and prostrate before your holy temple, will praise your name for your constant love, for you have exulted your promise above all. 
When I called you, you answered; you gave me strength, you inspired me. 
All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O Lord, when they shall have heard the words you have uttered; 
and they shall sing of the ways of the Lord, and tell of the Lord's transcendent glory. 
For, high though the Lord is, he looks on the lowly, and strikes down the haughty from far away. 
Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me: you lay your hand on my angry foes, and your right hand gives me victory. 
The Lord will accomplish all that which concerns me. Your kindness, O Lord, endures forever. O do not abandon the work of your hands.
