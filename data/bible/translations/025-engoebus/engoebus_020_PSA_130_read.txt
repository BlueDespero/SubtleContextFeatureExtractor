Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A song of ascents. Out of the depths I call to you, Lord. 
Lord, hear my voice: give heed with your ears to my loud plea. 
If you should mark sin, Lord, O Lord, who could stand? 
But with you is forgiveness, that you may be feared. 
I wait for the Lord, I wait for his word, 
I look for the Lord more than watchman for morning, than watchman for morning. 
Israel, hope in the Lord: with the Lord there is love with him plenteous redemption. 
And he redeems Israel from all his iniquities.
