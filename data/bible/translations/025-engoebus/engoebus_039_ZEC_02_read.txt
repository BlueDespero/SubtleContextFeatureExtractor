Zechariah.
Chapter 2.
Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
I said, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and length.” 
Then the messenger who talked with me stepped forward, and another messenger went out to meet him, 
and said to him, “Run and tell to that young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited like a village without walls, because so many people and cattle will live there. 
For I, says the Lord, will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. 
Up! Away! Flee from the land of the north, says the Lord. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says the Lord. 
Up, escape to Zion, you who live in Babylon. 
This is what the Lord of hosts says to the nations which plundered you: Whoever touches you touches the apple of my eye. 
I will raise my hand against them. They will be plunder for their own slaves; and you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me. 
“Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! I am coming, I will live among you, says the Lord. 
Many nations will join themselves to the Lord in that day, and will be his people, and he will live among you. You will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. 
The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land. He will again choose Jerusalem. 
Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the Lord, because he is coming from his holy dwelling.”
