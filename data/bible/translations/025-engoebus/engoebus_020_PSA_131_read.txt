Psalms.
Chapter 131.
A song of ascents. Of David. O Lord, my heart is not haughty, my eyes are not lofty, I walk not among great things, things too wonderful for me. 
Yes, I have soothed and stilled myself, like a young child on his mother's lap; like a young child am I. 
O Israel, hope in the Lord from now and for evermore.
