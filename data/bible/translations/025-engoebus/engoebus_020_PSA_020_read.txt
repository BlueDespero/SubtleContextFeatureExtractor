Psalms.
Chapter 20.
For the leader. A psalm of David. The Lord answer you in the day of distress, the name of the Jacob's God protect you, 
sending you help from the temple, out of Zion supporting you. 
All your meal-offerings may he remember, your burnt-offerings look on with favor. Selah 
May he grant you your heart's desire, and bring all your plans to pass. 
We will shout then for joy at your victory, and rejoice in the name of our God. May the Lord grant your every request. 
Now I am sure that the Lord will help his anointed. From his temple in heaven he will answer by his mighty triumphant right hand. 
Some in chariots are strong, some in horses; but our strength is the Lord our God. 
They will totter and fall, while we rise and stand firm. 
Give victory, Lord, to the king, and answer us when we call.
