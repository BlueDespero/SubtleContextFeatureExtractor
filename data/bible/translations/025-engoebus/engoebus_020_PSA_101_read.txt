Psalms.
Chapter 101.
Of David, a psalm. If kindness and justice I sing, making melody to you, Lord. 
I would look to the way that is blameless, and make it my own. Within my own house I would walk with an innocent heart. 
I would never direct my eyes to a thing that is base. The impulse to stray I abhor it shall not cling to me. 
Far from me be perverseness of heart, or kinship with evil. 
Who slanders their neighbor in secret, I bring them to silence: haughty looks and proud hearts I will not abide. 
I will favor the true in the land, they shall live in my court. Those who walk in a way that is blameless will be my attendant. 
No one will live in my house who practises guile. No one that speaks a lie will abide in my presence. 
Morn by morn I will wholly wipe out all the bad in the land, and cut off from the Lord's own city all workers of evil.
