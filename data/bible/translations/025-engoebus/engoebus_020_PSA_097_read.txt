Psalms.
Chapter 97.
The Lord is king, let the earth rejoice: let her many isles be glad. 
Clouds and darkness are round about him, justice and right are the base of his throne. 
Fire goes before him, and blazes around his steps, 
his lightnings illumine the world: the earth quakes at the sight. 
Mountains melt like wax before the Lord of all the earth. 
The heavens proclaim his justice, all nations behold his glory. 
Shamed are all image-worshippers, who make a boast of their idols. All the gods bow before him. 
Zion is glad at the tidings, the towns of Judah rejoice because of your judgments, Lord. 
For you are most high over all the earth, greatly exalted above all gods. 
The Lord loves those who hate evil, he guards the lives of the faithful: from the hand of the wicked he saves them. 
Light arises for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. 
Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous: give thanks to his holy name.
