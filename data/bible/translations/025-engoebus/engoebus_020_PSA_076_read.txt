Psalms.
Chapter 76.
For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song. God has made himself known in Judah, his name is great in Israel. 
His tent is in Salem, his dwelling in Zion. 
There he broke the lightning arrows, shield, sword, and weapons of war. Selah 
Terrible is your splendor on the everlasting mountains. 
Despoiled were the stout of heart; in the sleep into which they had fallen, none of the warriors could lift a hand. 
At your rebuke, God of Jacob, sank chariot and horse to sleep. 
Awful are you: who can stand before you, when once you are angry? 
The judgment you gave from heaven frightened the earth into silence, 
when God arose to judgment to save the oppressed of the earth. Selah 
The fiercest will praise you, to you will the remnant hold festival. 
Vow and pay to Lord your God, and let all who are round him bring presents. 
He lops off the courage of princes, and with terror fills kings of the earth.
