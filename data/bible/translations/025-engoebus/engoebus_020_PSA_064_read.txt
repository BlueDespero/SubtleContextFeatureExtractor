Psalms.
Chapter 64.
For the leader. A psalm of David. Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament: guard my life from the foe who affrights me. 
Hide me from villains who secretly plot, from the blustering throng of the workers of evil, 
who have sharpened their tongue like a sword, and aimed bitter words like arrows, 
which from ambush they launch at the blameless, shooting swiftly and unafraid. 
They strengthen their wicked purpose, they tell of the snares they have hidden, they say to themselves, “Who can see?” 
They think out their crimes full cunningly hidden deep in their crafty hearts. 
But God with his arrow will shoot them, swiftly shall they be smitten. 
For their tongue he will bring them to ruin, all will shudder with horror at the sight of them. 
Then every person, touched to awe, as they ponder what God has wrought, will tell the tale of his deeds. 
In the Lord shall the righteous rejoice, in him shall they take refuge; and all the true-hearted shall glory.
