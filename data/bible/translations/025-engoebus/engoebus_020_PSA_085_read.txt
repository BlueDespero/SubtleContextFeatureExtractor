Psalms.
Chapter 85.
For the leader. Of the Korahites, a psalm. Once, Lord, you did favor your land, granting change of fortune to Jacob, 
forgiving the guilt of your people, pardoning all their sin, Selah 
withdrawing all your fury, turning from your hot anger. 
Restore us, O God our savior, put away your displeasure against us. 
Will you cherish your anger against us forever, prolonging your wrath to all generations? 
Will you not revive us again, that your people may be glad in you? 
Show us your kindness, O Lord, grant us your salvation. 
Let me hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak of peace to his people, to those who love him, and turn their hearts to him. 
Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves, and glory shall live in our land. 
Kindness and loyalty meet; peace and righteousness kiss. 
Loyalty springs from the earth; righteousness looks from the sky. 
The Lord shall give all that is good, our land yielding its increase, 
righteousness marching before him, and peace on the path he treads.
