Psalms.
Chapter 142.
A maskil of David, while he was in the cave, a prayer. Loudly I cry to the Lord: to the Lord plead loudly for mercy, 
I pour my complaint before him, I tell my troubles to him. 
When my spirit is faint within me, my path is known to you. In the way I am wont to walk in, they have hidden a trap for me. 
I look to the right and the left; but not a friend have I. No place of refuge is left me, not a man to care for me. 
So I cry to you, O Lord: I say, “My refuge are you, all I have in the land of the living.” 
Attend to my piercing cry, for very weak am I. Save me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 
Free me from prison, that I may give thanks to your name, for the righteous are patiently waiting till you show your bounty to me.
