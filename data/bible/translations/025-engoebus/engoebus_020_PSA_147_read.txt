Psalms.
Chapter 147.
Hallelujah. It is good to sing praise to our God, for praise is sweet and seemly. 
The Lord builds up Jerusalem, the outcasts of Israel he gathers. 
He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. 
He counts the numberless stars, he gives names to them all. 
Great is our Lord, rich in power, and measureless is his wisdom. 
The Lord lifts up the down-trodden, the wicked he brings to the ground. 
Sing songs of thanks to the Lord, and play on the lyre to our God. 
For he covers the sky with clouds, he prepares rain for the earth, makes grass to grow on the mountains. 
He gives the cattle their food the young ravens when they cry. 
His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, his joy is not in the speed of a runner; 
but the Lord has his pleasure in those who fear him, in those who wait for his kindness. 
Praise the Lord, then, O Jerusalem: sing praise to your God, O Zion. 
For he strengthens the bars of your gates, and blesses your children within you. 
He brings peace to your borders, and choicest of wheat in abundance. 
He sends his command to the earth: his word runs very swiftly. 
Snow he gives like wool, frost he scatters like ashes. 
He casts forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 
He sends forth his word, and melts them: his wind blows the waters flow. 
He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and judgments to Israel. 
No other nation did he do this for, they know nothing of his judgments. Hallelujah.
