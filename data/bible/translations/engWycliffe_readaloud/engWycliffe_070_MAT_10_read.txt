Matthew.
Chapter 10.
And whanne his twelue disciplis weren clepid togidere, he yaf to hem powere of vnclene spiritis, to caste hem out of men, and to heele eueri langour, and sijknesse. 
And these ben the names of the twelue apostlis; the firste, Symount, that is clepid Petre, and Andrew, his brothir; James of Zebede, and Joon, his brothir; Filip, and Bartholomeu; 
Thomas, and Matheu, pupplican; and James Alfey, and Tadee; 
Symount Chananee, and Judas Scarioth, that bitrayede Crist. 
Jhesus sente these twelue, and comaundide hem, and seide, Go ye not `in to the weie of hethene men, and entre ye not in to the citees of Samaritans; 
but rather go ye to the scheep of the hous of Israel, that han perischid. 
And go ye, and preche ye, and seie, that the kyngdam of heuenes shal neiye; 
heele ye sike men, reise ye deede men, clense ye mesels, caste ye out deuelis; freeli ye han takun, freli yyue ye. 
Nyle ye welde gold, nether siluer, ne money in youre girdlis, not a scrippe in the weie, 
nether twei cootis, nethir shoon, nether a yerde; for a werkman is worthi his mete. 
In to what euere citee or castel ye schulen entre, axe ye who therynne is worthi, and there dwelle ye, til ye go out. 
And whanne ye goon in to an hous, `grete ye it, and seyn, Pees to this hous. 
And if thilk hous be worthi, youre pees schal come on it; but if that hous be not worthi, youre pees schal turne ayen to you. 
And who euere resseyueth not you, nethir herith youre wordis, go ye fro that hous or citee, and sprenge of the dust of youre feet. 
Treuly Y seie to you, it shal be more suffrable to the loond of men of Sodom and of Gommor in the dai of iugement, than to thilke citee. 
Lo! Y sende you as scheep in the myddil of wolues; therfor be ye sliy as serpentis, and symple as dowues. 
But be ye war of men, for thei schulen take you in counseilis, and thei schulen bete you in her synagogis; 
and to meyris, or presidentis, and to kyngis, ye schulen be lad for me, in witnessyng to hem, and to the hethen men. 
But whanne thei take you, nyle ye thenke, hou or what thing ye schulen speke, for it shal be youun `to you in that our, what ye schulen speke; 
for it ben not ye that speken, but the spirit of youre fadir, that spekith in you. 
`And the brother shal take the brother in to deeth, and the fader the sone, and sones schulen rise ayens fadir and modir, and schulen turmente hem bi deeth. 
And ye schulen be in hate to alle men for my name; but he that shall dwelle stille in to the ende, shal be saaf. 
And whanne thei pursuen you in this citee, fle ye in to anothir. Treuli Y seie to you, ye schulen not ende the citees of Israel, to for that mannus sone come. 
The disciple is not aboue the maistir, ne the seruaunt aboue hys lord; 
it is ynowy to the disciple, that he be as his maistir, and to the seruaunt as his lord. If thei han clepid the hosebonde man Belsabub, hou myche more his houshold meyne? 
Therfor drede ye not hem; for no thing is hid, that schal not be shewid; and no thing is priuey, that schal not be wist. 
That thing that Y seie to you in derknessis, seie ye in the liyt; and preche ye on housis, that thing that ye heeren in the ere. 
And nyle ye drede hem that sleen the bodi; for thei moun not sle the soule; but rather drede ye hym, that mai lese bothe soule and bodi in to helle. 
Whether twei sparewis ben not seeld for an halpeny? and oon of hem shal not falle on the erthe with outen youre fadir. 
`And alle the heeris of youre heed ben noumbrid. 
Therfor nyle ye drede; ye ben betere than many sparewis. 
Therfor euery man that schal knouleche me bifore men, Y schal knouleche hym bifor my fadir that is in heuenes. 
But he that shal denye me bifor men, and I shal denye him bifor my fadir that is in heuenes. 
Nile ye deme, that Y cam to sende pees in to erthe; Y cam not to sende pees, but swerd. 
For Y cam to departe a man ayens his fadir, and the douytir ayens hir modir, and the sones wijf ayens the housbondis modir; 
and the enemyes of a man ben `thei, that ben homeli with him. 
He that loueth fadir or modir more than me, is not worthi to me. And he that loueth sone or douyter ouer me, is not worthi to me. 
And he that takith not his croos, and sueth me, is not worthi to me. 
He that fyndith his lijf, shal lose it; and he that lesith his lijf for me, shal fynde it. 
He that resseyueth you, resseyueth me; and he that resseyueth me, resseyueth hym that sente me. 
He that resseyueth a prophete in the name of a prophete, shal take the mede of a prophete. And he that resseyueth a iust man in the name of a iust man, schal take the mede of a iust man. 
And who euer yyueth drynke to oon of these leeste a cuppe of coolde watir oonli in the name of a disciple, treuli Y seie to you, he shal not leese his mede.
