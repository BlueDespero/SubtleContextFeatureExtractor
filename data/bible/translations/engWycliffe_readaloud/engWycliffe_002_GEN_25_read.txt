Forsothe Abraham weddide another wijf, Ceture bi name,

Also Jexan gendride Saba and Dadan. Forsothe the sones of Dadan weren Asurym, and Lathusym, and Laomym. 
And sotheli of Madian was borun Efa, and Ofer, and Enoth, and Abida, and Heldaa; alle these weren the sones of Cethure. 
And Abraham yaf alle thingis whiche he hadde in possessioun to Isaac; 
sotheli he yaf yiftis to the sones of concubyns; and Abraham, while he lyuede yit, departide hem fro Ysaac, his sone, to the eest coost. 
Forsothe the daies of lijf of Abraham weren an hundrid and `fyue and seuenti yeer; 
and he failide, and diede in good eelde, and of greet age, and ful of daies, and he was gaderid to his puple. 
And Ysaac and Ismael, his sones, birieden him in the double denne, which is set in the feeld of Efron, sone of Seor Ethei, 
euene ayens Mambre, which denne he bouyte of the sones of Heth; and he was biried there, and Sare his wijf. 
And aftir the deeth of Abraham God blesside Isaac his sone, which dwellide bisidis the pit bi name of hym that lyueth and seeth. 
These ben the generaciouns of Ismael, sone of Abraham, whom Agar Egipcian, seruauntesse of Sare, childide to Abraham; 
and these ben the names of the sones of Ismael, in her names and generaciouns. The firste gendride of Ismael was Nabaioth, aftirward Cedar, and Abdeel, and Mabsan, 
and Masma, and Duma, and Massa, 
and Adad, and Thema, and Ithur, and Nafir, and Cedma. 
These weren the sones of Ismael, and these weren names by castels and townes of hem, twelue princes of her lynagis. 
And the yeeris of lijf of Ismael weren maad an hundrid and seuene and thretti, and he failide, and diede, and was put to his puple. 
Forsothe he enhabitide fro Euila til to Sur, that biholdith Egipt, as me entrith in to Assiriens; he diede bifore alle his britheren. 
Also these ben the generaciouns of Ysaac sone of Abraham. Abraham gendride Isaac, 
and whanne Isaac was of fourti yeer, he weddide a wijf, Rebecca, douyter of Batuel, of Sirie of Mesopotanye, the sistir of Laban. 
And Isaac bisouyte the Lord for his wijf, for sche was bareyn; and the Lord herde him, and yaf conseiuyng to Rebecca. 
But the litle children weren hurtlid togidre in hir wombe; and sche seide, If it was so to comynge to me, what nede was it to conseyue? And sche yede and axide counsel of the Lord, 
which answerde, and seide, Twei folkis ben in thi wombe, and twei puplis schulen be departid fro thi wombe, and a puple schal ouercome a puple, and the more schal serue the lesse. 
Thanne the tyme of childberyng cam, and lo! twei children weren foundun in hir wombe. 
He that yede out first was reed, and al rouy in the manere of a skyn; and his name was clepid Esau. 
Anoon the tothir yede out, and helde with the hond the heele of the brother; and therfore he clepide him Jacob. Isaac was sixti yeer eeld, whanne the litle children weren borun. 
And whanne thei weren woxun, Esau was maad a man kunnynge of huntyng, and a man erthe tilier; forsothe Jacob was a symple man, and dwellide in tabernaclis. 
Isaac louyde Esau, for he eet of the huntyng of Esau; and Rebecca louyde Jacob. 
Sotheli Jacob sethide potage; and whanne Esau cam weri fro the feld, 
he seide to Jacob, Yyue thou to me of this reed sething, for Y am ful weri; for which cause his name was clepid Edom. 
And Jacob seide to him, Sille to me the riyt of the first gendrid childe. 
He answerde, Lo! Y die, what schulen the firste gendrid thingis profite to me? 
Jacob seide, therfor swere thou to me. Therfor Esau swoor, and selde the firste gendrid thingis. 
And so whanne he hadde take breed and potage, Esau eet and drank, and yede forth, and chargide litil that he hadde seld the riyt of the firste gendrid child.
