Chapter 10.
And whanne Nadab and Abyu, the sones of Aaron, hadden take censeris, thei puttiden fier and encense aboue, and offriden bifor the Lord alien fier, which thing was not comaundid to hem. 
And fier yede out fro the Lord, and deuouride hem, and thei weren deed bifor the Lord. 
And Moises seide to Aaron, This thing it is which the Lord spak, Y schal be halewid in hem that neiyen to me, and Y schal be glorified in the siyt of al the puple; which thing Aaron herde, and was stille. 
Sotheli whanne Moises hadde clepid Mysael and Elisaphan, the sones of Oziel, brother of Aaron's fadir, he seide to hem, Go ye, and take awey youre britheren fro the siyt of seyntuarie, and bere ye out of the castels. 
And anoon thei yeden, and token hem, as thei laien clothid with lynnun cootis, and castiden out, as it was comaundid to hem. 
And Moises spak to Aaron, and to Eliasar and Ithamar, the sones of Aaron, Nyle ye make nakid youre heedis, and nyle ye reende clothis, lest perauenture ye dien, and indignacioun rise on al the cumpany; youre britheren and all the hows of Israel byweile the brennyng which the Lord reiside. 
But ye schulen not go out of the yatis of the tabernacle, ellis ye schulen perische; for the oile of hooli anoyntyng is on you. Whiche diden alle thingis bi the comaundement of Moises. 
Also the Lord seide to Aaron, 
Thou and thi sones schulen not drynke wyn, and al thing that may make drunkun, whanne ye schulen entre in to the tabernacle of witnessing, lest ye dien; for it is euerlastynge comaundement in to youre generaciouns, 
that ye haue kunnyng to make doom bytwixe hooli thing and vnhooli, bitwixe pollutid thing and cleene; 
and that ye teche the sones of Israel alle my lawful thingis, whiche the Lord spak to hem bi the hond of Moyses. 
And Moises spak to Aaron, and to Eliazar and Ythamar, hise sones, that weren residue, Take ye the sacrifice that lefte of the offryng of the Lord, and ete ye it with out sour dow, bisidis the auter, for it is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis. 
Sotheli ye schulen ete in the hooli place that that is youun to thee and to thi sones, of the offryngis of the Lord, as it is comaundid to me Also thou, 
and thi sones, and thi douytris with thee, schulen ete in the clenneste place the brest which is offrid, and the schuldur which is departid; for tho ben kept to thee and to thi fre sones, of the heelful sacrifices of the sones of Israel; 
for thei reiseden bifor the Lord the schuldur and brest, and the ynnere fatnessis that ben brent in the auter; and perteynen tho to thee, and to thi sones, bi euerlastynge lawe, as the Lord comaundide. 
Among these thingis whanne Moises souyte the `buk of geet that was offrid for synne, he foond it brent, and he was wrooth ayens Eliazar and Ythamar, `the sones of Aaron that weren left. 
And he seide, Whi eten not ye the sacrifice for synne in the hooli place, which sacrifice is hooli `of the noumbre of hooli thingis, and is youun to you, that ye bere the wickydnesse of the multitude, and preye for it in the siyt of the Lord; 
moost sithen of the blood therof is not borun yn with ynne hooli thingis, and ye ouyten ete it in the seyntuarie, as it is comaundid to me? 
And Aaron answeride, Sacrifice for synne, and brent sacrifice is offrid to dai bifor the Lord; sotheli this that thou seest, bifelde to me; how myyte Y ete it, ether plese God in cerymonyes with soreuful soule? 
And whanne Moises hadde herd this, he resseyuede satisfaccioun.
