Chapter 7.
And the Farisees and summe of the scribis camen fro Jerusalem togidir to hym. 
And whanne thei hadden seen summe of hise disciplis ete breed with vnwaisschen hoondis, thei blameden. 
The Farisees and alle the Jewis eten not, but thei waisschen ofte her hoondis, holdynge the tradiciouns of eldere men. 
And whanne thei turnen ayen fro chepyng, thei eten not, but thei ben waisschen; and many other thingis ben, `that ben taken `to hem to kepe, wasschyngis of cuppis, and of watir vessels, and of vessels of bras, and of beddis. 
And Farisees and scribis axiden hym, and seiden, Whi gon not thi disciplis aftir the tradicioun of eldere men, but with vnwasschen hondis thei eten breed? 
And he answeride, and seide to hem, Ysaie prophesiede wel of you, ypocritis, as it is writun, This puple worschipith me with lippis, but her herte is fer fro me; 
and in veyn thei worschipen me, techinge the doctrines and the heestis of men. 
For ye leeuen the maundement of God, and holden the tradiciouns of men, wasschyngis of watir vessels, and of cuppis; and many othir thingis lijk to these ye doon. 
And he seide to hem, Wel ye han maad the maundement of God voide, `to kepe youre tradicioun. 
For Moyses seide, Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir; and he that cursith fadir or modir, die he by deeth. 
But ye seien, If a man seie to fadir or modir, Corban, that is, What euer yifte is of me, it schal profite to thee; 
and ouer ye suffren not hym do ony thing to fadir or modir, 
and ye breken the word of God bi youre tradicioun, that ye han youun; and ye don many suche thingis. 
And he eftsoone clepide the puple, and seide to hem, Ye alle here me, and vndurstonde. 
No thing that is withouten a man, that entrith in to hym, may defoule him; but tho thingis that comen forth of a man, tho it ben that defoulen a man. 
If ony man haue eeris of hering, here he. 
And whanne he was entrid in to an hous, fro the puple, hise disciplis axiden hym the parable. 
And he seide to hem, Ye ben vnwise also. Vndurstonde ye not, that al thing without forth that entreth in to a man, may not defoule hym? 
for it hath not entrid in to his herte, but in to the wombe, and bynethe it goith out, purgynge alle metis. 
But he seide, The thingis that gon out of a man, tho defoulen a man. 
For fro with ynne, of the herte of men comen forth yuel thouytis, auowtries, 
fornycaciouns, mansleyingis, theftis, auaricis, wickidnessis, gile, vnchastite, yuel iye, blasfemyes, pride, foli. 
Alle these yuels comen forth fro with ynne, and defoulen a man. 
And Jhesus roos vp fro thennus, and wente in to the coostis of Tyre and of Sidon. And he yede in to an hous, and wolde that no man wiste; and he myyte not be hid. 
For a womman, anoon as sche herd of hym, whos douytir hadde an vnclene spirit, entride, and fel doun at hise feet. 
And the womman was hethen, of the generacioun of Sirofenyce. And sche preiede hym, that he wolde caste out a deuel fro hir douyter. 
And he seide to hir, Suffre thou, that the children be fulfillid first; for it is not good to take the breed of children, and yyue to houndis. 
And sche answeride, and seide to him, Yis, Lord; for litil whelpis eten vndur the bord, of the crummes of children. 
And Jhesus seide to hir, Go thou, for this word the feend wente out of thi douytir. 
And whanne sche was gon in to hir hous home, sche foonde the damysel ligynge on the bed, and the deuel gon out fro hir. 
And eftsoones Jhesus yede out fro the coostis of Tire, and cam thorou Sidon to the see of Galilee, bitwixe the myddil of the coostis of Decapoleos. 
And thei bryngen to hym a man deef and doumbe, and preieden hym to leye his hoond on hym. 
And he took hym asidis fro the puple, and puttide hise fyngris in to hise eris; and he spetide, and touchide his tonge. 
And he bihelde in to heuene, and sorewide with ynne, and seide, Effeta, that is, Be thou openyd. 
And anoon hise eris weren openyd, and the boond of his tunge was vnboundun, and he spak riytli. 
And he comaundide to hem, that thei schulden seie to no man; but hou myche he comaundide to hem, so myche more thei prechiden, 
and bi so myche more thei wondriden, and seiden, He dide wel alle thingis, and he made deef men to here, and doumbe men to speke.
