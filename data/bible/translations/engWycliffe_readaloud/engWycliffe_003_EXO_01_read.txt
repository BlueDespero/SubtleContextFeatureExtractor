Exodus.
Chapter 1.
These ben the names of the sones of Israel, that entriden into Egipt with Jacob; alle entriden with her housis; 
Ruben, Symeon, 
Leuy, Judas, Isachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin, 
Dan, and Neptalim, Gad, and Aser. 
Therfor alle the soules of hem that yeden out of `the hipe of Jacob weren seuenti and fyue. 
Forsothe Joseph was in Egipt; and whanne he was deed, and alle hise brithren, and al his kynrede, 
the sones of Israel encreessiden, and weren multiplied as buriounnyng, and thei weren maad strong greetli, and filliden the lond. 
A newe kyng, that knewe not Joseph, roos in the meene tyme on Egipt, and seide to his puple, Lo! 
the puple of the sones of Israel is myche, and strongere than we; 
come ye, wiseli oppresse we it, lest perauenture it be multiplied; and lest, if batel risith ayens vs, it be addid to oure enemyes, and go out of the lond, whanne we ben ouercomun. 
And so he made maistris of werkis souereyns to hem, that thei schulden turmente hem with chargis. And thei maden citees of tabernaclis to Farao, Fiton, and Ramesses. 
And bi hou myche thei oppressiden hem, bi so myche thei weren multiplied, and encreessiden more. 
And Egipcians hatiden the sones of Israel, and turmentiden, and scorneden hem; 
and brouyten her lijf to bitternesse bi hard werkis of cley and to tijl stoon, and bi al seruage, bi which thei weren oppressid in the werkis of erthe. 
Forsothe the kyng of Egipt seide to the mydwyues of Ebrews, of whiche oon was clepid Sefora, the tother Fua; 
and he commaundide to hem, Whanne ye schulen do the office of medewyues to Ebrew wymmen, and the tyme of childberyng schal come, if it is a knaue child, sle ye him; if it is a womman, kepe ye. 
Forsothe the medewyues dredden God, and diden not bi the comaundement of the kyng of Egipt, but kepten knaue children. 
To whiche clepid to hym the kyng seide, What is this thing which ye wolden do, that ye wolden kepe the children? 
Whiche answeriden, Ebrew wymmen ben not as the wymmen of Egipt, for thei han kunnyng of the craft of medewijf, and childen bifore that we comen to hem. 
Therfor God dide wel to medewyues; and the puple encreesside, and was coumfortid greetli. 
And for the mydewyues dredden God, he bildide `housis to hem. 
Therfor Farao comaundide al his puple, and seide, What euer thing of male kynde is borun to Ebrewis, `caste ye into the flood; what euer thing of wymmen kynde, kepe ye.
