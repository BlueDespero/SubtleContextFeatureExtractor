Psalm.
Chapter 55.
To the director: With instruments. A maskil of David. God, hear my prayer. Don’t ignore my cry for help. 
Please listen and answer me. Let me speak to you and tell you what upsets me. 
My enemies shout at me and threaten me. In their anger they attack me. They bring troubles crashing down on me. 
My heart is pounding inside me. I am afraid to die. 
I am trembling with fear. I am terrified! 
Oh, I wish I had wings like a dove. I would fly away and find a place to rest. 
I would go far into the desert and stay there. Selah 
I would run away. I would escape from this storm of trouble. 
My Lord, confuse their words and stop their plans. I see so much cruelty and fighting in this city. 
Day and night, in every neighborhood, the city is filled with evil and trouble. 
There is so much crime in the streets. People who hurt and cheat others are everywhere. 
If it were an enemy insulting me, I could bear it. If it were my enemies attacking me, I could hide. 
But it is you, the one so close to me, my companion, my good friend, who does this. 
We used to share our secrets with one another, as we walked through the crowds together in God’s Temple. 
I wish death would take my enemies by surprise! I wish the earth would open up and swallow them alive, because they plan such terrible things together. 
I will call to God for help, and the LORD will save me. 
I speak to God morning, noon, and night. I tell him what upsets me, and he listens to me! 
I have fought in many battles, but he has always rescued me and brought me back safely. 
God, who has always ruled as king, will hear me and punish my enemies. Selah But they will never change. They don’t fear and respect God. 
This one who was once my friend now attacks his friends. He is breaking every promise he made. 
His words about peace are as smooth as butter, but he has only war on his mind. His words are as slick as oil, but they cut like a knife. 
Give your worries to the LORD, and he will care for you. He will never let those who are good be defeated. 
But, God, you will send those liars and murderers to the grave. They will die before their life is half finished! As for me, I will put my trust in you.
