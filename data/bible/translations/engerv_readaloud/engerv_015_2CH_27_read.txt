2 Chronicles.
Chapter 27.
Jotham was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha. Jerusha was Zadok’s daughter. 
Jotham did what the LORD wanted him to do. He obeyed God just as his father Uzziah had done. But Jotham did not enter the LORD’S Temple to burn incense as his father had. But the people continued doing wrong. 
Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the LORD’S Temple. He did much building on the wall at the place named Ophel. 
He also built towns in the hill country of Judah. He built fortresses and towers in the forests. 
Jotham also fought against the king of the Ammonites and his army and defeated them. So each year for three years the Ammonites gave Jotham 3 3/4 tons of silver, 62,000 bushels of wheat, and 62,000 bushels of barley. 
Jotham became powerful because he faithfully obeyed the LORD his God. 
Everything else Jotham did and all his wars are written in the book, The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
Jotham was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled 16 years in Jerusalem. 
Then Jotham died and was buried with his ancestors. The people buried him in the City of David. Jotham’s son Ahaz became king in his place.
