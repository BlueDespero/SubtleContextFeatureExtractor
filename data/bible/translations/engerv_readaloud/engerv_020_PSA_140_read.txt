Psalm.
Chapter 140.
To the director: A praise song of David. LORD, save me from people who are evil. Protect me from those who are cruel, 
from those who plan to do evil and always cause trouble. 
Their words are as harmful as the fangs of a snake, as deadly as its venom. Selah 
LORD, save me from the wicked! Protect me from these cruel people who plan to hurt me. 
These proud people are trying to trap me. They spread nets to catch me; they set traps in my path. Selah 
LORD, you are my God. LORD, listen to my prayer. 
My Lord GOD, you are the powerful one who saves me. You protect my head in battle. 
LORD, don’t let the wicked have what they want. Don’t let their plans succeed. Selah 
My enemies are planning trouble for me. Lord, make that trouble fall on them. 
Pour burning coals on their heads. Throw them into the fire. Throw them into pits they can never escape. 
Don’t let those cruel liars enjoy success here. Let disaster hunt them down. 
I know the LORD will provide justice for the poor and will defend the helpless. 
Those who do what is right will praise your name; those who are honest will live in your presence.
