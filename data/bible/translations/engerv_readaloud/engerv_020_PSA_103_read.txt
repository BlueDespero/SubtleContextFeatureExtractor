Psalm.
Chapter 103.
A song of David. My soul, praise the LORD! Every part of me, praise his holy name! 
My soul, praise the LORD and never forget how kind he is! 
He forgives all our sins and heals all our sicknesses. 
He saves us from the grave, and he gives us love and compassion. 
He gives us plenty of good things. He makes us young again, like an eagle that grows new feathers. 
The LORD does what is fair. He brings justice to all who have been hurt by others. 
He taught his laws to Moses. He let Israel see the powerful things he can do. 
The LORD is kind and merciful. He is patient and full of love. 
He does not always criticize. He does not stay angry with us forever. 
We sinned against him, but he didn’t give us the punishment we deserved. 
His love for his followers is as high above us as heaven is above the earth. 
And he has taken our sins as far away from us as the east is from the west. 
The LORD is as kind to his followers as a father is to his children. 
He knows all about us. He knows we are made from dust. 
He knows our lives are short, that they are like grass. He knows we are like a little wildflower that grows so quickly, 
but when the hot wind blows, it dies. Soon, you cannot even see where the flower was. 
But the LORD has always loved his followers, and he will continue to love them forever and ever! He will be good to all their descendants, 
to those who are faithful to his agreement and who remember to obey his commands. 
The LORD set his throne up in heaven, and he rules over everything. 
Angels, praise the LORD! You angels are the powerful soldiers who obey his commands. You listen to him and obey his commands. 
Praise the LORD, all his armies. You are his servants, and you do what he wants. 
Everything the LORD has made should praise him throughout the world that he rules! My soul, praise the LORD!
