Psalm.
Chapter 82.
One of Asaph’s songs of praise. God stands in the assembly of the gods. He stands as judge among the judges. 
He says, “How long will you judge unfairly and show special favors to the wicked?” Selah 
“Defend the poor and orphans. Protect the rights of the poor. 
Help those who are poor and helpless. Save them from those who are evil. 
“They don’t know what is happening. They don’t understand! They don’t know what they are doing. Their world is falling down around them!” 
I, God Most High, say, “You are gods, my own sons. 
But you will die as all people must die. Your life will end like that of any ruler.” 
Get up, God! You be the judge! You be the leader over all the nations!
