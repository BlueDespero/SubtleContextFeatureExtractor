Psalm.
Chapter 147.
Praise the LORD because he is good. Sing praises to our God. It is good and pleasant to praise him. 
The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem. He brings back the Israelites who were taken as prisoners. 
He heals their broken hearts and bandages their wounds. 
He counts the stars and knows each of them by name. 
Our Lord is great and powerful. There is no limit to what he knows. 
The LORD supports the humble, but he shames the wicked. 
Give thanks to the LORD. Praise our God with harps. 
He fills the sky with clouds. He sends rain to the earth. He makes the grass grow on the mountains. 
He gives food to the animals. He feeds the young birds that cry out. 
War horses and powerful soldiers are not what he cares about. 
The LORD enjoys people who worship him and trust in his faithful love. 
Jerusalem, praise the LORD! Zion, praise your God! 
He makes your gates strong, and he blesses the people in your city. 
He brought peace to your country, so you have plenty of grain for food. 
He gives a command to the earth, and it quickly obeys. 
He makes the snow fall until the ground is as white as wool. He makes sleet blow through the air like dust. 
He makes hail fall like rocks from the sky. No one can stand the cold he sends. 
Then he gives another command, and warm air begins to blow. The ice melts, and water begins to flow. 
He gave his commands to Jacob. He gave his laws and rules to Israel. 
He did not do this for any other nation. He did not teach his laws to other people. Praise the LORD!
