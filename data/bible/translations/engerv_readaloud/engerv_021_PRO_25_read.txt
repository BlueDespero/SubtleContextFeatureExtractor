Proverbs.
Chapter 25.
These are some more wise sayings from Solomon. These proverbs were copied by servants of Hezekiah, the king of Judah. 
We honor God for the things he keeps secret. But we honor kings for the things they can discover. 
We cannot discover how high the sky is above us or how deep the earth is below. The same is true with the minds of kings. We cannot understand them. 
Remove the worthless things from silver to make it pure, and a worker can make something beautiful. 
Take the evil advisors away from a king, and goodness will make his kingdom strong. 
Don’t brag about yourself before the king and pretend you are someone important. 
It is much better for the king to invite you to take a more important position than to embarrass you in front of his officials. 
Don’t be too quick to tell a judge about something you saw. You will be embarrassed if someone else proves you wrong. 
If you want to tell your friends about your own problems, tell them. But don’t discuss what someone told you in private. 
Whoever hears it will lose their respect for you and will never trust you again. 
Saying the right thing at the right time is like a golden apple in a silver setting. 
Wise advice to a listening ear is like gold earrings or fine jewelry. 
To his master who sent him, a messenger who can be trusted is as refreshing as a drink of cold water on a hot summer day. 
People who promise to give gifts but never give them are like clouds and wind that bring no rain. 
With patience, you can make anyone change their thinking, even a ruler. Gentle speech is very powerful. 
Honey is good, but don’t eat too much of it, or you will be sick. 
And don’t visit your neighbors’ homes too often, or they will begin to hate you. 
A person who gives false testimony against a neighbor is as deadly as a club, a sword, or a very sharp arrow. 
Never depend on a liar in times of trouble. It’s like chewing with a bad tooth or walking with a crippled foot. 
Singing happy songs to a sad person is as foolish as taking a coat off on a cold day or mixing soda and vinegar. 
If your enemies are hungry, give them something to eat. If they are thirsty, give them some water. 
This will make them feel the burning pain of shame, and the LORD will reward you for being good to them. 
Just as wind blowing from the north brings rain, telling secrets brings anger. 
It is better to live in a small corner of the roof than to share the house with a woman who is always arguing. 
Good news from a faraway place is like a cool drink of water when you are hot and thirsty. 
Good people who don’t stand strong against evil are like springs that have been polluted or pools that have turned dirty and muddy. 
Just as eating too much honey is not good, it is not good for people to always be looking for honor. 
People who cannot control themselves are like cities without walls to protect them.
