Proverbs.
Chapter 12.
Whoever loves discipline loves to learn; whoever hates to be corrected is stupid. 
It is good to learn what pleases the LORD, because he condemns those who plan to do wrong. 
Evil people are never safe, but good people remain safe and secure. 
A good wife is like a crown to her husband, but a shameful wife is like a cancer. 
Good people are honest and fair in all they do, but those who are evil lie and cannot be trusted. 
Evil people use their words to hurt others, but the words from good people can save others from danger. 
When evil people are destroyed, they are gone and forgotten, but good people are remembered long after they are gone. 
You praise people for their intelligence, but no one respects those who are stupid. 
It is better to appear unimportant and have a servant than to pretend to be important and have no food. 
Good people take good care of their animals, but the wicked know only how to be cruel. 
Farmers who work their land have plenty of food, but those who waste their time on worthless projects are foolish. 
The wicked want a share of what an evil man might catch. But like a plant with deep roots, a good man is the one who produces the most. 
The wicked are trapped by their foolish words, but good people escape from such trouble. 
People get good things for the words they say, and they are rewarded for the work they do. 
Fools always think their own way is best, but wise people listen to what others tell them. 
Fools are easily upset, but wise people avoid insulting others. 
Good people speak the truth and can be trusted in court, but liars make bad witnesses. 
Speak without thinking, and your words can cut like a knife. Be wise, and your words can heal. 
Lies last only a moment, but the truth lasts forever. 
People who work for evil make trouble, but those who plan for peace bring happiness. 
The Lord will keep good people safe, but evil people will have many troubles. 
The LORD hates people who tell lies, but he is pleased with those who tell the truth. 
Smart people don’t tell everything they know, but fools tell everything and show they are fools. 
Those who work hard will be put in charge of others, but lazy people will have to work like slaves. 
Worry takes away your joy, but a kind word makes you happy. 
Good people are careful about choosing their friends, but evil people always choose the wrong ones. 
Lazy people don’t get what they want, but riches come to those who work hard. 
Along the path of goodness there is life; that is the way to live forever.
