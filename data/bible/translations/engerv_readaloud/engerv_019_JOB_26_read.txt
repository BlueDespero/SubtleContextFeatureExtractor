Job.
Chapter 26.
Then Job answered: 
“Bildad, what a great help you are to this tired, weary man! You have really supported me! 
You have given such wonderful advice to this foolish man! You have provided so much useful information! 
Who helped you say these things? Whose spirit inspired you to speak? 
“The ghosts and their neighbors in the underworld shake with fear. 
But God can see clearly into that place of death. Death is not hidden from God. 
God stretched the northern sky over empty space. He hung the earth on nothing. 
He fills the thick clouds with water. But he does not let its heavy weight break the clouds open. 
He covers the face of the full moon. He spreads his clouds over it and hides it. 
He drew the horizon on the ocean, like a circle where light and darkness meet. 
The foundations that hold up the sky shake with fear when God threatens them. 
With his own power God calmed the sea. With his wisdom he destroyed Rahab. 
His breath made the skies clear. His hand destroyed the snake that tried to get away. 
These are only a few of the amazing things God has done. We hear only a small whisper of God’s thundering power.”
