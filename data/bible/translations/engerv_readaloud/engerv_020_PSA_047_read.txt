Psalm.
Chapter 47.
To the director: A song from the Korah family. Everyone, clap your hands. Shout with joy to God! 
The LORD Most High is awesome. He is the great King over all the earth. 
He helped us defeat other nations. He put those people under our control. 
He chose our land for us. He chose that wonderful land for Jacob, the one he loved. Selah 
The LORD God goes up to his throne at the sound of the trumpet and horn. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! 
God is the King of the whole world. Sing songs of praise! 
God sits on his holy throne; he rules all the nations. 
The leaders of the nations have come together with the people of the God of Abraham. All the rulers of the world belong to God. He is over them all!
