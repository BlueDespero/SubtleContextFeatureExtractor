Psalm.
Chapter 58.
To the director: To the tune “Don’t Destroy.” A miktam of David. You judges are not being fair in your decisions. You are not judging people fairly. 
No, you only think of evil things to do. You do violent crimes in this country. 
Those wicked people started doing wrong as soon as they were born. They have been liars from birth. 
Their anger is as deadly as the poison of a snake. They shut their ears like a deaf cobra 
that does not listen to the music of the snake charmers, no matter how well they play. 
God, they are like lions. So LORD, break their teeth. 
May they disappear like water down a drain. May they be crushed like weeds on a path. 
May they be like snails melting away as they move. May they be like a baby born dead, who never saw the light of day. 
May they be destroyed suddenly, like the thorns that are burned to quickly heat a pot. 
Good people will be happy when they see the wicked getting the punishment they deserve. They will feel like soldiers walking through the blood of their enemies! 
Then people will say, “Good people really are rewarded. Yes, there is a God judging the world!”
