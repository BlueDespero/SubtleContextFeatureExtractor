Psalm.
Chapter 25.
A song of David. LORD, I put my life in your hands. 
I trust in you, my God, and I will not be disappointed. My enemies will not laugh at me. 
No one who trusts in you will be disappointed. But disappointment will come to those who try to deceive others. They will get nothing. 
LORD, help me learn your ways. Show me how you want me to live. 
Guide me and teach me your truths. You are my God, my Savior. You are the one I have been waiting for. 
Remember to be kind to me, LORD. Show me the tender love that you have always had. 
Don’t remember the sinful things I did when I was young. Because you are good, LORD, remember me with your faithful love. 
The LORD is good and does what is right. He shows sinners the right way to live. 
He teaches his ways to humble people. He leads them with fairness. 
The LORD is kind and true to those who obey what he said in his agreement. 
LORD, I have done many wrong things. But I ask you to forgive them all to show your goodness. 
When people choose to follow the LORD, he shows them the best way to live. 
They will enjoy good things, and their children will get the land God promised. 
The LORD tells his secrets to his followers. He teaches them about his agreement. 
I always look to the LORD for help. Only he can free me from my troubles. 
I am hurt and lonely. Turn to me, and show me mercy. 
Free me from my troubles. Help me solve my problems. 
Look at my trials and troubles. Forgive me for all the sins I have done. 
Look at all the enemies I have. They hate me and want to hurt me. 
Protect me! Save me from them! I come to you for protection, so don’t let me be disappointed. 
You are good and do what is right. I trust you to protect me. 
God, save the people of Israel from all their enemies.
