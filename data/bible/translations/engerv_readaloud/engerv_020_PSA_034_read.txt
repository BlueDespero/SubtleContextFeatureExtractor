Psalm.
Chapter 34.
A song of David when he pretended to be crazy so that Abimelech would send him away, which he did. I will praise the LORD at all times. I will never stop singing his praises. 
Humble people, listen and be happy, while I brag about the LORD. 
Praise the LORD with me. Let us honor his name. 
I went to the LORD for help, and he listened. He saved me from all that I fear. 
If you look to him for help, he will put a smile on your face. You will have no need to be ashamed. 
As a poor, helpless man I prayed to the LORD, and he heard me. He saved me from all my troubles. 
The LORD’S angel builds a camp around his followers, and he protects them. 
Give the LORD a chance to show you how good he is. Great blessings belong to those who depend on him! 
The LORD’S holy people should fear and respect him. Those who respect him will always have what they need. 
Even strong lions get weak and hungry, but those who go to the LORD for help will have every good thing. 
Children, come and listen to me; I will teach you to respect the LORD. 
Do you want to enjoy life? Do you want to have many happy days? 
Then avoid saying anything hurtful, and never let a lie come out of your mouth. 
Stop doing anything evil, and do good. Look for peace, and do all you can to help people live peacefully. 
The LORD watches over those who do what is right, and he hears their prayers. 
But the LORD is against those who do evil, so they are forgotten soon after they die. 
Pray to the LORD, and he will hear you. He will save you from all your troubles. 
The LORD is close to those who have suffered disappointment. He saves those who are discouraged. 
Good people might have many problems, but the LORD will take them all away. 
He will protect them completely. Not one of their bones will be broken. 
But troubles will kill the wicked. The enemies of those who live right will all be punished. 
The LORD saves his servants. All who go to him for protection will escape punishment.
