Psalm.
Chapter 3.
A song of David written during the time he was running from his son Absalom. LORD, I have so many enemies. So many people have turned against me. 
They say to themselves, “God will not rescue him!” Selah 
But you, LORD, protect me. You bring me honor; you give me hope. 
I will pray to the LORD, and he will answer me from his holy mountain. Selah 
I can lie down to rest and know that I will wake up, because the LORD covers and protects me. 
So I will not be afraid of my enemies, even if thousands of them surround me. 
LORD, get up! My God, come rescue me! If you hit my enemies on the cheek, you will break all their teeth. 
LORD, the victory is yours! You are so good to your people. Selah
