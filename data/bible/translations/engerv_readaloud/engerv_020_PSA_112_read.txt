Psalm.
Chapter 112.
Praise the LORD! Great blessings belong to those who fear and respect the LORD, who are happy to do what he commands. 
Their descendants will be given power on earth. Those who do right will be greatly blessed. 
Their family will be very rich, and their goodness will continue forever. 
A light shines in the dark for those who are good, for those who are merciful, kind, and fair. 
It is good for people to be kind and generous and to be fair in business. 
Such good people will never fall. They will always be remembered. 
They will not be afraid of bad news. They are confident because they trust in the LORD. 
They remain confident and without fear, so they defeat their enemies. 
They freely give to the poor. Their goodness will continue forever. They will be honored with victory. 
The wicked become angry when they see this. They grind their teeth in anger, but then they disappear. They will never get what they want most.
