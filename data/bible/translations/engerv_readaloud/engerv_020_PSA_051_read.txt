Psalm.
Chapter 51.
To the director: A song of David written when Nathan the prophet came to him after David’s sin with Bathsheba. God, be merciful to me because of your faithful love. Because of your great compassion, erase all the wrongs I have done. 
Scrub away my guilt. Wash me clean from my sin. 
I know I have done wrong. I remember that sin all the time. 
I did what you said is wrong. You are the one I have sinned against. I say this so that people will know that I am wrong and you are right. What you decided is fair. 
I was born to do wrong, a sinner before I left my mother’s womb. 
You want me to be completely loyal, so put true wisdom deep inside of me. 
Remove my sin and make me pure. Wash me until I am whiter than snow! 
Let me hear sounds of joy and happiness again. Let the bones you crushed be happy again. 
Don’t look at my sins. Erase them all. 
God, create a pure heart in me, and make my spirit strong again. 
Don’t push me away or take your Holy Spirit from me. 
Your help made me so happy. Give me that joy again. Make my spirit strong and ready to obey you. 
I will teach the guilty how you want them to live, and the sinners will come back to you. 
God, spare me from the punishment of death. My God, you are the one who saves me! Let me sing about all the good things you do for me! 
My Lord, I will open my mouth and sing your praises! 
You don’t really want sacrifices, or I would give them to you. 
The sacrifice that God wants is a humble spirit. God, you will not turn away someone who comes with a humble heart and is willing to obey you. 
God, please be good to Zion. Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. 
Then you can enjoy the kind of sacrifices you want. You will receive whole burnt offerings, and people will again offer bulls on your altar.
