Psalm.
Chapter 86.
A prayer of David. I am a poor, helpless man. LORD, please listen to me and answer my prayer! 
I am your follower, so please protect me. I am your servant, and you are my God. I trust in you, so save me. 
My Lord, be kind to me. I have been praying to you all day. 
My Lord, I put my life in your hands. I am your servant, so make me happy. 
My Lord, you are good and merciful. You love all those who call to you for help. 
LORD, hear my prayer. Listen to my cry for mercy. 
I am praying to you in my time of trouble. I know you will answer me. 
My Lord, there is no God like you. No one can do what you have done. 
My Lord, you made everyone. I wish they all would come worship you and honor your name. 
You are great and do amazing things. You and you alone are God. 
LORD, teach me your ways, and I will live and obey your truths. Help me make worshiping your name the most important thing in my life. 
My Lord God, I praise you with all my heart. I will honor your name forever! 
You have such great love for me. You save me from the place of death. 
Proud people are attacking me, God. A gang of cruel men is trying to kill me. They don’t respect you. 
My Lord, you are a kind and merciful God. You are patient, loyal, and full of love. 
Show that you hear me and be kind to me. I am your servant, so give me strength. I am your slave, as my mother was, so save me! 
LORD, show me a sign that you care for me. My enemies will see it and be disappointed, because you helped and comforted me.
