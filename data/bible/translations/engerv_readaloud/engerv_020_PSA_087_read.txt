Psalm.
Chapter 87.
A song of praise from the Korah family. The LORD built his city on the holy hills. 
He loves the gates of Zion more than any other place in Israel. 
Wonderful things are said about you, City of God. Selah 
God says, “Some of my people live in Egypt and Babylon. Some of them were born in Philistia, Tyre, and even Ethiopia.” 
But about Zion he says, “I know each and every person born there.” It is the city built by God Most High. 
The LORD keeps a list of all his people, and he knows where each of them was born. Selah 
At the festivals, people will dance and sing, “All good things come from Zion.”
