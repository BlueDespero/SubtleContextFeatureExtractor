Psalm.
Chapter 96.
Sing a new song to the LORD! Let the whole world sing to the LORD! 
Sing to the LORD and praise his name! Tell the good news every day about how he saves us! 
Tell all the nations how wonderful he is! Tell people everywhere about the amazing things he does. 
The LORD is great and worthy of praise. He is more awesome than any of the “gods.” 
All the “gods” in other nations are nothing but statues, but the LORD made the heavens. 
He lives in the presence of glory and honor. His Temple is a place of power and beauty. 
Praise the LORD, all people of every nation; praise the LORD’S glory and power. 
Give the LORD praise worthy of his glory! Come, bring your offerings into his courtyard. 
Worship the LORD in all his holy beauty. Everyone on earth should tremble before him. 
Tell the nations that the LORD is King! The world stands firm and cannot be moved. He will judge all people fairly. 
Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be happy! Let the sea and everything in it shout for joy! 
Let the fields and everything in them be happy! Let the trees in the forest sing for joy 
when they see the LORD coming! He is coming to rule the world. He will rule all the nations of the world with justice and fairness.
