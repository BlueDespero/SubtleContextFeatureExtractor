1 Corinthians.
Chapter 8.
Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. 
And if any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not anything yet as he ought to know; 
but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him. 
Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is none other God but one. 
For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many; 
yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him. 
Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, with conscience of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 
But food commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; nor, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak. 
For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 
And through thy knowledge shall the brother that is weak perish, for whose sake Christ died? 
And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. 
Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh forevermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.
