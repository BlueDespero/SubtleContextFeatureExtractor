James.
Chapter 4.
Whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members? 
Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not. 
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures. 
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God. 
Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? The spirit which dwelt in us longeth unto envying. 
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble. 
Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded. 
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you. 
Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
One only is the lawgiver, even he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest another? 
Come now, ye that say, Today and tomorrow let us go into this city, and spend one year there, and trade, and get gain: 
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? For it will be a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then also vanisheth away. 
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, let us both live, and do this or that. 
But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil. 
To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
