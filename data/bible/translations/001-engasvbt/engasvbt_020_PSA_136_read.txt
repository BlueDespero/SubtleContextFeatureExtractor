Psalms.
Chapter 136.
Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth forever. 
Oh give thanks unto the God of gods; For his lovingkindness endureth forever. 
Oh give thanks unto the Lord of lords; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him who alone doeth great wonders; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that by understanding made the heavens; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that spread forth the earth above the waters; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that made great lights; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
The sun to rule by day; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
The moon and stars to rule by night; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
And brought out Israel from among them; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that divided the Red Sea in sunder; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that led his people through the wilderness; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
To him that smote great kings; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
And slew famous kings; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
Sihon king of the Amorites; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
And Og king of Bashan; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
And gave their land for a heritage; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
Even a heritage unto Israel his servant; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
Who remembered us in our low estate; For his lovingkindness endureth forever; 
And hath delivered us from our adversaries; For his lovingkindness endureth forever: 
Who giveth food to all flesh; For his lovingkindness endureth forever. 
Oh give thanks unto the God of heaven; For his lovingkindness endureth forever.
