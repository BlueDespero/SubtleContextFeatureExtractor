Joshua.
Chapter 6.
Now Jericho was shut up, and barred up, because of the children of Israel: no one went out, and no one came in. 
And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho and its king, even the mighty men of valor. 
And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven cornets of rams' horns; and on the seventh day shall ye compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the cornets. 
And it shall come to pass, that, when they blow a long blast with the ram's horn, when ye hear the sound of the cornet all the people shall utter a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. 
And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven cornets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord. 
And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord. 
And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests, bearing the seven cornets of rams' horns before the Lord, passed on and blew with the cornets; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. 
And the armed men went before the priests that blew the cornets, and the rereward came after the ark, going on, and blowing with the cornets. 
And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you, Shout; and then shall ye shout. 
So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going round it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 
And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. 
And the seven priests bearing the seven cornets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the cornets; and the armed men went before them; and the rereward came after the ark of the Lord, going on, and blowing with the cornets. 
And they compassed the city on the second day once, and returned into the camp: so did they six days. 
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after this manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 
And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priest blew with the cornets, that Joshua' said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city. 
And the city shall be devoted, it, and all that is therein, to the Lord: only Rachab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house; because she did hide the messengers that we sent. 
But ye, keep yourselves from the devoted things, lest ye devote and yet take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. 
And all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, shall be holy unto the Lord: into the treasury of the Lord shall they come. 
So the people shouted, when they blew with the cornets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the cornet, that the people uttered a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, and the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city. 
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and lamb, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 
But unto the two men that had spied out the country, Joshua said, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence the woman, and all belonging to her, as ye have sworn unto her. 
And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rachab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all belonging to her: and they brought out all her kindred, and they left them without the camp of Israel. 
And the city they burnt with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of copper and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord. 
And Rachab the harlot did Joshua save alive, and her father's household, and all belonging to her; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel even unto this day; because she had hidden the messengers, whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. 
And Joshua adjured the people at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that will rise up and build this city Jericho: with his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and with his youngest shall he set up its gates. 
And the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was spread throughout all the country.
