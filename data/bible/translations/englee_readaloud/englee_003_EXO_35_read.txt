Exodus.
Chapter 35.
And Moses gathered together all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the things which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them. 
Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: whosoever doth work thereon shall be put to death. 
Ye shall not kindle any fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. 
And Moses said unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, as followeth, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying, 
Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord: Gold, and silver, and copper, 
And blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and linen thread, and goats' hair, 
And rams' skills dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, 
And oil for the lighting, and spices, for the anointing oil, and for the incense of spices, 
And onyx stones, and stones for setting, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 
And all the wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that which the Lord hath commanded: 
The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
The ark, and its staves, with the mercy-seat, and the vail of the separation; 
The table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread; 
And the candlestick for the lighting, and its vessel, and its lamps, with the oil for the lighting; 
And the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the incense of spices, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle; 
The altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of copper, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot; 
The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court; 
The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords; 
The cloths of service, to do service therewith in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in as priests. 
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
And they came, every man whose heart stirred him up; and every one whom his spirit made willing, brought the Lord's offering for the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all its service, and for the holy garments. 
And they came, the men with the women; whoever was willing-hearted, brought bracelets, and earrings, and finger-rings, and tablets, all kinds of ornaments of gold, and every man that offered an offering of gold unto the Lord. 
And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet yarn, and linen thread, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, brought them. 
Every one that did offer an offering of silver and copper brought it as the Lord's offering; and every one with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it. 
And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and they brought that which they had spun, of the blue, and of the purple, and of the scarlet yarn, and of the linen thread. 
And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair. 
And the princes brought the onyx stones, and the stones for setting, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 
And the spice and the oil, for lighting, and for the anointing oil, and for the incense of spices. 
Every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be made, by the hand of Moses, even that brought the children of Israel as a free-will offering unto the Lord. 
And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, of the tribe of Judah; 
And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
And to devise works of art, to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper, 
And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in the carving of wood, to make any manner of work of art. 
And to teach hath he put in his heart, both to him, and to Aholiab, the son of Achissamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
He hath filled them with wisdom of heart, to execute all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the designing weaver, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet yarn, and in linen thread, and of the weaver, of those that do every species of work, and of those that devise works of art.
