Hosea.
Chapter 12.
(12:2) Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind; the whole day he increaseth deceit and corruption; and a covenant do they make with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 
(12:3) But with Judah also hath the Lord to hold a controversy; and to punish Jacob according to his ways, according to his doings will he recompense him. 
(12:4) In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his strength he strove with an angel. 
(12:5) Yea, he strove with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: in Beth-el he should find him, and there he will speak with us. 
(12:6) And the Lord God of hosts, the Eternal One is his memorial. 
(12:7) Therefore do thou return to thy God: keep goodness and justice, and wait on thy God continually. 
(12:8) But like a merchant, who hath the balances of deceit in his hand, loving to overreach, 
(12:9) Did Ephraim say, I am certainly become rich, I have acquired substance unto myself: it is all through my labors; they will find no iniquity in me, that could be sin. 
(12:10) And I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt: I will yet make thee dwell in tents, as in the days of antiquity. 
(12:11) And I have spoken through the prophets, and I myself have multiplied visions, and by the means of the prophets have I spoken in similitudes. 
(12:12) If in Gil'ad there was misfortune, it is because there was naught but idolatry; in Gilgal they sacrificed bullocks to idols: their altars also are as stone-heaps on the furrows of the fields. 
(12:13) And Jacob fled into the fields of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept the flocks. 
(12:14) And by a prophet did the Lord bring Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he guarded. 
(12:15) Yet Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore will his Lord cast his blood-guiltiness upon him, and his reproach will he recompense unto him.
