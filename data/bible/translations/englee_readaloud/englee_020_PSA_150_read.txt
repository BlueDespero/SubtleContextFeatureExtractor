Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Hallelujah. Praise ye God in his sanctuary: praise him in the expansion of his power. 
Praise him for his acts of might: praise him according to the abundance of his greatness. 
Praise him with the blowing of the cornet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and pipe. 
Praise him upon the clear-ringing cymbals: praise him upon the high-sounding cymbals. 
Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
