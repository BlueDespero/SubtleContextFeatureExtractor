Psalms.
Chapter 120.
“A song of the degrees.” Unto the Lord, when I was in distress, did I call, and he hath answered me. 
O Lord, deliver my soul from lips of falsehood, and from a tongue of deceit. 
What will God give unto thee? or what will he add unto thee, thou tongue of deceit? 
Sharpened arrows of the mighty, with coals of the broom-bush. 
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 
Too long for herself hath my soul dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
