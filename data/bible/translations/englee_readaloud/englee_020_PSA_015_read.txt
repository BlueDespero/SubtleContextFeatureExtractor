Psalms.
Chapter 15.
“A psalm of David.” Lord, who may sojourn in thy tent? who may dwell on thy holy mount? 
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart; 
That uttereth no calumny with his tongue, that doth no evil to his neighbor, and bringeth no reproach on his fellow-man; 
In whose eyes the despicable is despised; but that honoreth those who fear the Lord; that sweareth to his own injury, and changeth not; 
That putteth not out his money for interest, and taketh no bribe against the innocent. He that doth these things shall not be moved to eternity.
