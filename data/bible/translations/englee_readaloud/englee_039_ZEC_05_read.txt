Zechariah.
Chapter 5.
And I again lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold there was a flying roll-book. 
And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll, its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. 
Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of all the earth; for every one that stealeth as it is on this side shall be in an equal degree entirely destroyed, as also every one that sweareth falsely as it is on that side shall be likewise entirely destroyed. 
I bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones. 
Then went forth the angel that spoke with me, and said unto me, Do but lift up thy eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. 
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance through all the earth. 
And, behold, there was lifted up a heavy cover of lead: and there was a certain woman sitting in the midst of the ephah. 
And he said, This is the wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weighty lead cover upon the mouth thereof. 
Then did I lift up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, having the wind in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
Then said I to the angel that spoke with me, Whither are these bearing away the ephah? 
And he said unto me, To build for it a house in the land of Shin'ar: and when this is erected, then will the other be set there upon its own base.
