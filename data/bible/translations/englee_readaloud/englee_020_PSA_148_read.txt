Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Hallelujah. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 
Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 
Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens. 
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he commanded and they were created. 
And he established them for ever and to eternity: he gave a decree which none shall transgress. 
Praise the Lord from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 
Fire, and hail, snow, and vapor; thou storm-wind that fulfillest his word; 
Ye mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars; 
Ye beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and winged birds; 
Ye kings of the earth, and all nations; ye princes, and all judges of the earth; 
Young men and also virgins; old men, together with boys:— 
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven. 
He also exalteth the horn of his people, a praise unto all his pious servants, even unto the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Hallelujah.
