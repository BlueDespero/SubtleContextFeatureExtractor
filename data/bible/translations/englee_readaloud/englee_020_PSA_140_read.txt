Psalms.
Chapter 140.
“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” (140:2) Deliver me, O Lord, from an evil man; from a man of violence do thou keep me; 
(140:3) Who think over evil resolves in their heart, who every day are gathered together for war. 
(140:4) They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the poison of the adder is under their lips. Selah. 
(140:5) Preserve me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked, from the man of violence do thou keep me, who think of overthrowing my steps. 
(140:6) The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the side of my track; traps have they set for me. Selah. 
(140:7) I have said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: give ear, O Lord, to the voice of my supplications. 
(140:8) O thou Eternal Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head on the day of battle. 
(140:9) Grant not, O Lord, the longings of the wicked; suffer not his wicked device to succeed: lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 
(140:10) As for the heads of those that encompass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
(140:11) Let burning coals be cast upon them: let them be thrown into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 
(140:12) Let not the man of an evil tongue be established on the earth: may evil hunt down the violent man to his downfall. 
(140:13) I know that the Lord will procure right for the afflicted, and justice for the needy. 
(140:14) Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell before thy presence.
