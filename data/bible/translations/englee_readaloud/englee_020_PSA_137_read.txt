Psalms.
Chapter 137.
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, and we also wept when we remembered Zion. 
Upon the willows in her midst had we hung up our harps. 
For there our captors demanded of us the words of song; and those that mocked us, joy, saying, Sing for us one of the songs of Zion. 
How should we sing the song of the Lord on the soil of the stranger? 
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget—. 
May my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not remember thee: if I recall not Jerusalem at the head of my joy. 
Remember, O Lord, unto the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to her very foundation. 
O daughter of Babylon, who art wasted: happy he, that repayeth thee thy recompense for what thou hast done to us. 
Happy he, that seizeth and dasheth thy babes against the rock.
