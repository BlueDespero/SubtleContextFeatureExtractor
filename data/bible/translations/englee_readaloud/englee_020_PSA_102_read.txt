Psalms.
Chapter 102.
“A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out before the Lord his complaint.” (102:2) O Lord, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee. 
(102:3) Hide not thy face from me on the day when I am distressed; incline unto me thy ear; on the day when I call, answer me speedily. 
(102:4) For my days vanish in smoke, and my bones are burning like a hearth. 
(102:5) Struck by heat like the herb and dried up is my heart; for I forget to eat my bread. 
(102:6) Because of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh. 
(102:7) I am like the pelican of the wilderness: I am become like the owl amid ruins. 
(102:8) I watch, and I am become like a night-bird sitting alone upon the housetop. 
(102:9) All the day my enemies reproach me: they that mock me swear by me. 
(102:10) For ashes do I eat like bread, and my drink I mingle with weeping; 
(102:11) Because of thy indignation and thy wrath; for thou hadst lifted me up, and hast cast me down. 
(102:12) My days are like a shadow that declineth; and like the herb I wither. 
(102:13) But thou, O Lord, wilt sit enthroned for ever; and thy memorial is unto all generations. 
(102:14) Thou wilt indeed arise; thou wilt have mercy upon Zion; for it is time to favor her, for the appointed time is coming. 
(102:15) For thy servants hold dear her stones, and her very dust they cherish. 
(102:16) Then shall nations fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory: 
(102:17) When the Lord shalt have built up Zion, he appeareth in his glory; 
(102:18) When he hath regarded the prayer of the forsaken, and doth not despise their prayer. 
(102:19) This shall be written down for the latest generation; and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. 
(102:20) For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; the Lord hath cast from heaven his view to the earth: 
(102:21) To hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loosen those that are doomed to death: 
(102:22) That men may proclaim in Zion the name of the Lord, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
(102:23) When people are gathered together, and kingdoms, to serve the Lord.— 
(102:24) He hath weakened on the way my strength; he hath shortened my days. 
(102:25) I will say, O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days: throughout all generations are thy years. 
(102:26) In olden times didst thou lay the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
(102:27) These will indeed perish, but thou wilt ever exist: yea, all of them will wear out like a garment; as a vesture wilt thou change them, and they will be changed; 
(102:28) But thou art ever the same, and thy years will have no end. 
(102:29) The children of thy servants will dwell securely, and their seed will be firmly established before thee.
