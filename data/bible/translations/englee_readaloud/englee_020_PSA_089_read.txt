Psalms.
Chapter 89.
“A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrachite.” (89:2) The kindnesses of the Lord will I for ever sing: from generation to generation will I make known thy faithfulness with my mouth. 
(89:3) For I have said, To eternity will kindness be built up: the heavens—yea, in these wilt thou establish thy faithfulness. 
(89:4) “I have made a covenant with my elect, I have sworn unto David my servant, 
(89:5) Unto eternity will I establish thy seed, and I will build up thy throne, from generation to generation.” Selah. 
(89:6) And the heavens praise thy wonder, O Lord: also thy faithfulness in the assembly of holy ones. 
(89:7) For who in the sky can be compared unto the Lord? who can be likened unto the Lord among the sons of the mighty? 
(89:8) God is greatly terrific in the secret council of the holy ones and fear-inspiring over all that are about him. 
(89:9) O Lord God of hosts, who is powerful, like thee, Eternal! and thy faithfulness is round about thee. 
(89:10) Thou rulest over the pride of the sea: when its waves are lifted up, thou assuagest them. 
(89:11) Thou didst crush Rahab as one that is slain: with thy strong arm didst thou scatter thy enemies. 
(89:12) Thine are the heavens, also thine is the earth: as for the world and what filleth it, thou hast founded them. 
(89:13) The north and the south—these hast thou created: Tabor and Chermon shall rejoice in thy name. 
(89:14) Thine is the powerful arm, with might: strong is thy hand, and exalted is thy right hand. 
(89:15) Righteousness and justice are the prop of thy throne: kindness and truth precede thy presence. 
(89:16) Happy is the people that know the cornet's sound: O Lord, in the light of thy countenance will they ever walk firmly. 
(89:17) In thy name will they be glad all the day, and in thy righteousness will they be exalted. 
(89:18) For thou art the glory of their strength; and through thy favor will our horn be exalted. 
(89:19) For of the Lord is our shield; and of the Holy One of Israel is our king. 
(89:20) Then spokest thou in a vision to thy pious servant, and saidst, “I have bestowed help to one that is mighty; I have exalted a youth out of the people; 
(89:21) I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him; 
(89:22) With whom my hand shall be firmly established; also my arm shall strengthen him; 
(89:23) The enemy shall not exact from him like a lender: and the son of injustice shall not afflict him: 
(89:24) And I will beat down before his face his assailants, and those that hate him will I plague. 
(89:25) But my faithfulness and my kindness shall be with him: and through my name shall his horn be exalted. 
(89:26) And I will place on the sea his hand, and on the rivers his right hand. 
(89:27) He will call unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 
(89:28) Also I will appoint my first-born, the highest among the kings of the earth. 
(89:29) For evermore will I keep for him my kindness, and my covenant shall stand faithfully with him. 
(89:30) And I appoint for ever his seed, and his throne as the days of heaven. 
(89:31) If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my ordinances; 
(89:32) If they profane my statutes, and keep not my commandments: 
(89:33) Then will I visit with the rod their transgressions, and with plagues their iniquity. 
(89:34) Nevertheless my kindness will I not make utterly void from him, and I will not act falsely against my faithfulness. 
(89:35) I will not profane my covenant, and what is gone out of my lips will I not alter. 
(89:36) One thing have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David. 
(89:37) His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne shall be like the sun before me. 
(89:38) Like the moon shall it be firmly established for ever, and as this faithful witness in the sky.” Selah. 
(89:39) And yet thou hast east off and despised, thou hast become wroth with thy anointed. 
(89:40) Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned, down to the ground, his crown. 
(89:41) Thou hast broken down all his fences: thou hast brought his strong-holds to terror. 
(89:42) All that pass by the way plunder him: he is become a reproach to his neighbors. 
(89:43) Thou hast raised up the right hand of his assailants: thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice. 
(89:44) Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not let him stand erect in the battle. 
(89:45) Thou hast made his brilliancy cease; and his throne hast thou thrown down to the ground. 
(89:46) Thou hast shortened the days of his youth: thou hast enshrouded him with shame. Selah. 
(89:47) How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself, continually? how long shall thy fury burn like fire? 
(89:48) Remember what I am, what my duration is here, for what nothingness thou hast created all sons of men! 
(89:49) What man is there that can live, and shall not see death? that can deliver his soul from the power of the nether word? Selah. 
(89:50) Where are thy former kindnesses, O Lord, which thou hast sworn unto David by thy truth? 
(89:51) Remember, Lord, the disgrace of thy servants; that I bear in my bosom the burden of all the many nations; 
(89:52) That thy enemies have defied, O Lord; that they have defied the footsteps of thy anointed. 
(89:53) Blessed be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
