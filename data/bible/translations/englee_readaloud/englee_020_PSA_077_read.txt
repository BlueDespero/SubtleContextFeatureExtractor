Psalms.
Chapter 77.
“To the chief musician on Jeduthun, by Assaph a psalm.” (77:2) I lift up my voice unto God, and I cry; I lilt up my voice unto God: do then give ear unto me. 
(77:3) On the day of my distress I sought the Lord; in the night my hand was stretched out, and did not cease: my soul refused to be comforted. 
(77:4) I think of God, and moan: I reflect, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah. 
(77:5) Thou holdest my eyes awake: I am troubled and I cannot speak. 
(77:6) I think over the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
(77:7) I call to remembrance my song in the night; with my own heart I reflect: and my spirit maketh diligent search. 
(77:8) Will the Lord cast me off for ever? and will he never more give his favor again? 
(77:9) Is his kindness spent for ever? is his promise come to an end for all generations? 
(77:10) Hath God forgotten to be gracious? or hath he shut up in anger his mercies? Selah. 
(77:11) And I said, This shall be my entreaty, for the years of the right hand of the Most High. 
(77:12) I will remember the deeds of the Lord; for I will remember out of ancient times thy wonders. 
(77:13) I will meditate also of all thy work, and on thy deeds will I reflect. 
(77:14) O God, in holiness is thy way: where is there a god so great as God? 
(77:15) Thou art the God that dost wonders: thou hast made known among the people thy strength. 
(77:16) Thou hast redeemed with a mighty arm thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
(77:17) The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they shook: also the depths trembled. 
(77:18) The clouds poured out water; the skies sent forth thunder: also thy arrows sped along. 
(77:19) The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; lightnings gave light to the world; the earth trembled and quaked, 
(77:20) Through the sea led thy way, and thy path was through mighty waters, and thy footsteps could not be known. 
(77:21) Thou didst lead like a flock thy people by means of Moses and Aaron.
