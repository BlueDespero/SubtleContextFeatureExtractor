Psalms.
Chapter 46.
“To the chief musician: by the sons of Korach, upon 'Alamoth, a song.” (46:2) God is our protection and strength, a help in distresses, very readily found. 
(46:3) Therefore will we not fear, even when the earth is transformed, and when mountains are moved into the heart of the seas; 
(46:4) When the waters thereof roar and foam, when mountains quake before his majesty. Selah. 
(46:5) There is a river, its rivulets cause to rejoice the city of God, the sanctuary of the dwellings of the Most High. 
(46:6) God is in her midst; she shall not be moved: God will ever help her, at the dawning of her morning. 
(46:7) Nations rage, kingdoms are moved: he letteth his voice be heard, the earth melteth away. 
(46:8) The Lord of hosts is with us; a defense unto us is the God of Jacob. Selah. 
(46:9) Come, look at the deeds of the Lord, who hath made desolations on the earth. 
(46:10) He causeth wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in pieces; he burneth wagons in the fire. 
(46:11) Leave off, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted on the earth. 
(46:12) The Lord of hosts is with us; a defence unto us is the God of Jacob. Selah.
