Psalms.
Chapter 25.
“Of David.” Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
O my God, in thee do I trust, let me not be ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me. 
Yea, none that wait on thee will be put to shame: let those be put to shame who deal treacherously without cause. 
Show me, O Lord, thy ways; teach me thy paths. 
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation: on thee do I wait all the day. 
Remember thy mercies, O Lord, and thy kindnesses; for they are from everlasting. 
The sins of my youth and my transgressions do not remember: according to thy kindness bear thou me in remembrance, for the sake of thy goodness, O Lord. 
Good and upright is the Lord: therefore he pointeth out to sinners the right way. 
He guideth the meek in justice, and he teacheth the meek his way. 
All the paths of the Lord are kindness and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
For the sake of thy name, O Lord, pardon my iniquity: although it is great. 
Who is that man that feareth the Lord? to him will he point out the way which he is to choose? 
His soul shall abide in happiness: and his seed shall inherit the land. 
The secret counsel of the Lord is for those that fear him, and his covenant—to make it known to them. 
My eyes are ever directed toward the Lord; for he will draw out of the net my feet. 
Turn unto me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted. 
The distresses of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my afflictions. 
Look on my misery and my trouble; and forgive all my sins. 
Look at my enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with the hatred of violence. 
Oh, guard my soul; and deliver me: let me not be put to shame; for I put my trust in thee. 
Let integrity and uprightness guard me; for I wait on thee. 
Redeem, O God, Israel out of all his distresses.
