Malachi.
Chapter 4.
(3:19) For, behold, the day is coming, which shall burn as an oven; and all the presumptuous, yea, and all who practise wickedness shall be stubble: and the day that is coming shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, who will not leave them root or bough. 
(3:20) But there shall rise unto you that fear my name the sun of righteousness with healing in his wings: and ye will go forth, and grow fat as calves of the stall. 
(3:21) And ye will tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day that I create, saith the Lord of hosts. 
(3:22) Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, whom I commanded on Horeb for all Israel, statutes and ordinances. 
(3:23) Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and the dreadful. 
(3:24) And he shall turn back the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers: lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
