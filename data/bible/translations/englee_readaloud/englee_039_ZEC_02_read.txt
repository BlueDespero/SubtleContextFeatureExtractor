Zechariah.
Chapter 2.
(2:5) And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measure-cord in his hand. 
(2:6) Then said I, Whither art thou going? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is her breadth, and what is her length. 
(2:7) And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him; 
(2:8) And he said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Without walls shall Jerusalem be inhabited because of the multitude of men and cattle in her midst. 
(2:9) But I—I will be unto her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and for glory will I be in the midst of her. 
(2:10) Up! up! and flee away from the land of the north saith the Lord; for as the four winds of the heaven have I spread you abroad, saith the Lord. 
(2:11) Up, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. 
(2:12) For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, For the sake of your glory hath he sent me unto the nations that have despoiled you; for whoever toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye. 
(2:13) For, behold, I will swing my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall acknowledge that the Lord of hosts hath sent me. 
(2:14) Sing, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I am coming, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. 
(2:15) And many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day, and they shall be unto me for a people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 
(2:16) And the Lord will take Judah as his inheritance upon the holy land; and he will again make choice of Jerusalem. 
(2:17) Be silent, all flesh! before the Lord; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
