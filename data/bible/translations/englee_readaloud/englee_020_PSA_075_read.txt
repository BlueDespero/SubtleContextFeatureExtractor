Psalms.
Chapter 75.
“To the chief musician, Al-tashcheth, a psalm or song of Asaph.” (75:2) We give thanks unto thee, O God, we give thanks, and nigh is thy name: men relate thy wondrous deeds. 
(75:3) “For I will take up a fixed time when I will judge uprightly. 
(75:4) The earth and all her inhabitants are melting away: I myself establish firmly her pillars.” Selah. 
(75:5) I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn. 
(75:6) Lift not up on high your horn, speak not with a stiffly erect neck. 
(75:7) For neither from the rising of the sun, nor from his setting, nor from the wilderness of mountains cometh this; 
(75:8) But God is the judge: he lowereth one, and lifteth up another, 
(75:9) For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foameth, it is full of mixture: and he poureth out of the same; but its lees they drain, they drink—all the wicked of the earth. 
(75:10) But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
(75:11) And all the horns of the wicked will I hew off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
