Psalms.
Chapter 82.
“A psalm of Assaph.” God standeth in the congregation of God, in the midst of judges doth he judge. 
How long will ye judge unjustly, and treat with favor the face of the wicked? Selah. 
Judge uprightly the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and indigent. 
Release the poor and needy: deliver them out of the power of the wicked. 
They know not, nor will they understand; in darkness do they walk on: all the foundations of the earth are moved. 
I have indeed said, Ye are gods; and children of the most High are all of you. 
But verily like men shall ye die, and like one of the princes shall ye fall. 
Arise, O God, judge the earth; for thou wilt possess all the nations.
