Psalms.
Chapter 98.
“A psalm.” Oh sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done wonderful things: his right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the victory. 
The Lord hath made known his salvation: before the eyes of the nations hath he revealed his righteousness. 
He hath remembered his kindness and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
Shout joyfully unto the Lord, all the lands: break forth, and rejoice, and sing praises. 
Sing praises unto the Lord with the harp,—with the harp, and the voice of psalmody. 
With trumpets and the sound of cornet shout joyfully before the King, the Lord. 
Let the sea roar, with all that filleth it; the world, with those that dwell therein. 
Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains be joyful together, 
Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and people with equity.
