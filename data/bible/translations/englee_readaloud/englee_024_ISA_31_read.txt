Isaiah.
Chapter 31.
Woe to those that go down to Egypt for help; and depend for support on horses, and trust on chariots, because they are many; and on horsemen, because they are very strong; but who turn not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek not the Lord! 
Yet he also is wise, and bringeth evil, and taketh not back his words; and riseth up against the house of evil-doers, and against the help of those that work injustice. 
But the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit; and the Lord will stretch out his hand, and there shall stumble the helper, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall perish together. 
For thus hath said the Lord unto me, Just as the lion or the young lion growleth over his prey, against whom is called forth the company of shepherds, of whose voice he is not afraid, and is not depressed because of their multitude: thus will the Lord come down, to fight on mount Zion and on its hill. 
As fluttering birds, so will the Lord of hosts shield Jerusalem; shielding and delivering; sparing and preserving. 
Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. 
For on that day shall every man despise his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. 
Then shall Asshur fall by the sword of one who is not a man; and the sword of one who is not a son of earth shall devour him; and he shall flee him from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary. 
And his stronghold shall pass away for fear, and his princes shall be terrified because of the ensign, saith the Lord, who hath a fire in Zion, and a furnace in Jerusalem.
