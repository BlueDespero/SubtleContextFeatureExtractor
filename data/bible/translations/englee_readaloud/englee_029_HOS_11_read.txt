Hosea.
Chapter 11.
When Israel was yet young, then I loved him, and out of Egypt did I call my son. 
The prophets called them; but the more they went from them: unto the Be'alim would they sacrifice, and to the graven images would they burn incense. 
Yet I myself appointed a leader for Ephraim, who took them up in his arms; but they would not acknowledge that I healed them. 
With human cords I ever drew them forward, with leading-strings of love: and I was to them as those that lift off the yoke from their jaws, and I held out unto them food. 
He should not return unto the land of Egypt: yet now is the Assyrian his king; because they refused to repent. 
And the sword shall fall on his cities, and shall make an end of his boughs, and consume them, because of their evil counsels. 
For my people are only bent on backsliding from me; and though upward they call them, they altogether will not elevate themselves. 
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I surrender thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I change thee as Zeboyim? turned is my heart within me, all my compassion is enkindled together. 
I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; for God am I, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee, and I will not come with an enemy's hatred. 
They shall follow after the Lord, when he will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall hasten together from the west; 
They shall hasten together as birds out of Egypt, and as doves out of the land of Assyria: and I will cause them to dwell in their houses, saith the Lord. 
(12:1) With lies hath Ephraim encompassed me about, and with deceit, the house of Israel; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful to the Holy One.
