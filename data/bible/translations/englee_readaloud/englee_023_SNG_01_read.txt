The Song of Solomon.
Chapter 1.
The song of songs, which is Solomon's. 
Oh that he might kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy caresses are more pleasant than wine. 
To the smell are thy fragrant oils pleasant, like precious oil poured forth is thy name famous afar: therefore do maidens love thee. 
Oh draw me, after thee will we run: the king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee; we will recall thy caresses, more pleasant than wine; without deceit all love thee.— 
Black am I, yet comely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 
Look not so at me, because I am somewhat black, because the sun hath looked fiercely at me: my mother's children were angry with me; they appointed me to be keeper of the vineyards; but my vineyard, which is my own, have I not kept.— 
Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest? where lettest thou thy flock rest at noon? for why should I appear like a veiled mourner by the flocks of thy companions?— 
If thou knowest this not, O thou fairest of women, go but forth in the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids around the shepherds' dwellings.— 
Unto the horse in Pharaoh's chariot do I compare thee, my beloved. 
Comely are thy cheeks between strings of pearls, thy neck with rows of jewels. 
Chains of gold will we make for thee with studs of silver.— 
While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth its pleasant smell. 
A bundle of myrrh is my friend unto me, that resteth on my bosom. 
A copher-cluster is my friend unto me in the vineyards of 'En-gedi.— 
Lo, thou art beautiful, my beloved: lo, thou art beautiful: thy eyes are those of a dove.— 
Lo, thou art beautiful, my friend, also pleasant: also our couch is made in the green wood. 
The beams of our houses are cedars and our wainscoting of cypress-trees.
