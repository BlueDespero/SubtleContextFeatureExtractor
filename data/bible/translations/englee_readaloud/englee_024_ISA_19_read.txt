Isaiah.
Chapter 19.
The doom of Egypt. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and is coming to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved because of his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its inward parts. 
And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his fellow; city against city, kingdom against kingdom. 
And the spirit of Egypt shall be emptied out in its inward parts, and its counsel will I frustrate; and they will inquire of the idols, and of the charmers, and of those that have familiar spirits, and of the wizards. 
And I will surrender the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a rigorous king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts. 
And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up. 
And the rivers shall become foul; and shallow and dried up shall become the deep streams: reeds and flags shall wither. 
The well-rooted plants by the stream, by the mouth of the stream, and every thing sown by the stream, shall dry up, be scattered by the wind, and be no more. 
The fishermen also shall lament, and all they that cast an angle into the stream shall mourn; and they that spread nets upon the face of the waters shall languish. 
And ashamed shall be they that work in fine flax, and they that weave white cloth. 
And its foundations shall be beaten down, all that build sluices shall be grieved in soul. 
Surely fools are the princes of Zo'an, !!the wise of the counsellors of Pharaoh impart silly counsel: how can ye say unto Pharaoh, I am a son of the wise, a son of the ancient kings? 
Where are they, these, thy wise men? that they may tell thee now, that they know what the Lord of hosts hath resolved on over Egypt. 
The princes of Zo'an are become fools, deceived are the princes of Noph; and Egypt is led astray by the chiefs of its tribes. 
The Lord hath poured out in the midst thereof a spirit of perverseness: and they have led Egypt astray in all its work, as a drunkard reeleth astray in his vomit. 
And there shall not be for Egypt successful work, which the head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do. 
On that day shall Egypt be like the women: and it shall tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he waveth over it. 
And the land of Judah shall become unto Egypt a terror, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be in dread, because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath resolved against it. 
On that day shall be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing by the Lord of hosts; “The city of destruction” shall one be called. 
On that day shall there be all altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the Lord. 
And it shall be for a sign and for a testimony unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he will send them a helper, and a chief, and he shall deliver them. 
And the Lord will be made known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord on that day, and will do service with sacrifice and oblation; yea, they will make vows unto the Lord and perform them. 
And the Lord will thus strike Egypt, striking and healing it: and they will return unto the Lord, and he will be entreated of them, and heal them. 
On that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians into Asshur, and the Egyptians shall serve with Asshur the Lord. 
On that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the earth. 
Whom the Lord of hosts will have blessed, saying, Blessed be my people Egypt, and Asshur the work of my hands, and my heritage Israel.
