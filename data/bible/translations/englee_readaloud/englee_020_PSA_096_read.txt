Psalms.
Chapter 96.
Oh sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the lands. 
Sing unto the Lord, bless his name: announce from day to day his salvation. 
Relate among the nations his honor, among all the people his wonders. 
For the Lord is great, and greatly praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 
For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord hath made the heavens. 
Glory and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye families of the people, ascribe unto the Lord honor and strength. 
Ascribe unto the Lord the honor due unto his name: bear hither a present, and come unto his courts. 
Bow down unto the Lord in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all ye lands. 
Say among the nations, “The Lord reigneth;” therefore also the world is ever firmly established that it shall hot be moved: he will judge the people in equity. 
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roar, with all that filleth it. 
Let the field exult, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy, 
Before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and people in his truth.
