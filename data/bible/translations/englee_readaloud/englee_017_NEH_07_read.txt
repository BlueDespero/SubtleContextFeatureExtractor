Nehemiah.
Chapter 7.
And it came to pass, when the wall was built, that I set up the doors; and then were appointed the gatekeepers and the singers and the other Levites to their office. 
And I gave my brother Chanani, and Chananyah the commander of the fortress, charge over Jerusalem; for he was esteemed a faithful man, and one that feared God these many days. 
And I said unto them, The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun be hot; and while ye stand by, let them shut the doors, and do ye bar them; and station watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one opposite to his house. 
But the city was roomy in space and large: while the people therein were few, and the houses were not yet built. 
Then did my God put it into my heart, and I assembled together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might give in their genealogy; and I found a register of the genealogy of those who were come up at the first, and I found written therein: 
These arc the children of the province, that came up out of the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his own city; 
Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua', Nehemiah, 'Azaryah, Ra'amyah, Nachamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Misspereth, Bigvai, Nechum, Ba'anah. The number of the men of the people of Israel was:

The temple-servants: The children of Zicha, the children of Chassupha, the children of Tabba'oth, 
The children of Keross, the children of Si'a, the children of Padon, 
The children of Lebana, the children of Chagaba, the children of Salmai, 
The children of Chanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gachar, 
The children of Reayah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda. 
The children of Gazzam, the children of 'Uzza, the children of Passeach.

The children of Ya'ala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 
The children of Shephatyah, the children of Chattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebayim, the children of Amon. 
All the temple-servants, and the children of Solomon' servants, were three hundred ninety and two. 
And these were they who came up from Thel-melach, Thelcharsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not tell their family division and their descent, whether they were of Israel. 
The children of Delayah, the children of Tobiyah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. 
And of the priests: The children of Chobayah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gil'adite, and was called after their name. 
These sought for their family register, but it was not found: wherefore they were excluded, as unfit, from the priesthood. 
And the Thirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand up a priest with the Urim and Thummim. 
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and sixty: 
Besides these were their man-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred and forty and five singing men and singing women. 
Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 
Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 
And a portion of the chiefs of the divisions gave unto the work. The Thirshatha gave to the treasure, of gold one thousand drachms, fifty bowls, five hundred and thirty coats for the priests. 
And some of the chiefs of the divisions gave to the treasury of the work, of gold twenty thousand drachms, and of silver two thousand and two hundred manehs. 
And what the rest of the people gave was, of gold twenty thousand drachms, and of silver two thousand manehs, and priests coats sixty and seven. 
So the priests, and the Levites, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and some of the people, and the temple-servants, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities: and so came round the seventh month, while the children of Israel were in their cities.
