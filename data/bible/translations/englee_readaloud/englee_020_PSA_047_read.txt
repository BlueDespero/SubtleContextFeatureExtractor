Psalms.
Chapter 47.
“To the chief musician, a psalm for the sons of Korach.” (47:2) All ye people, clap your hands; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
(47:3) For the Lord is most high, fear-inspiring; he is a great king over all the earth. 
(47:4) He will subdue people under us, and nations under our feet. 
(47:5) He will choose for us our inheritance, the excellency of Jacob which he loveth. Selah. 
(47:6) God ascendeth amid a triumphal shout, the Lord, amid the sound of the cornet. 
(47:7) Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
(47:8) For God is King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 
(47:9) God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne. 
(47:10) The nobles of the people are gathered together, to be with the people of the God of Abraham; for unto God belong the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.
