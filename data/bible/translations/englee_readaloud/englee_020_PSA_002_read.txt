Psalms.
Chapter 2.
Wherefore do nations rage, and people meditate a vain thing? 
The kings of the earth raise themselves up, and rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed: 
“Let us break asunder their bands, and cast away from us their cords.” 
He who dwelleth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord will hold them in derision. 
Then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his displeasure will he terrify them. 
Saying, Yet have I appointed my king upon Zion my holy mount. 
I will announce the decree, the Lord hath said unto me, “My son art thou: I have indeed this day begotten thee. 
Ask it of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the uttermost ends of the earth. 
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; like a potter's vessel shalt thou dash them in pieces.” 
And now, O ye kings, be wise: take warning, ye judges of the earth. 
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
Do homage to the son, lest he be angry, and ye be lost on the way; for his wrath is so speedily kindled. Happy are all they that put their trust in him.
