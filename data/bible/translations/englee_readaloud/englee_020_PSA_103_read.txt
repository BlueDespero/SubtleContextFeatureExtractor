Psalms.
Chapter 103.
“Of David.” Bless, O my soul, the Lord, and all that is within me, his holy name. 
Bless, O my soul, the Lord, and forget not all his benefits: 
Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
Who redeemeth from the pit thy life; who crowneth thee with kindness and mercies; 
Who satisfieth with happiness thy spirit, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's plumage. 
The Lord executeth righteousness, and justice for all that are oppressed. 
He made known his ways unto Moses, unto the children of Israel his acts. 
Merciful and gracious is the Lord, long-suffering and abundant in kindness. 
Not for all eternity will he contend; nor will he for ever retain his anger. 
Not in accordance with our sins hath he dealt with us; nor according to our iniquities hath he requited us. 
For as high as heaven is above the earth, so mighty is his kindness toward those that fear him. 
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed from us our transgressions. 
As a father hath mercy on his children, so hath the Lord mercy on those that fear him. 
For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 
As for man, like the grass are his days: as the blossom of the field, so doth he bloom. 
When a wind but passeth over it, it is gone, and its place will recognize it no more. 
But the kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting over those that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children, 
To such as keep his covenant, and to those who remember his precepts to execute them. 
The Lord hath established in the heavens his throne; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 
Bless the Lord, ye his angels, mighty in strength, that execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
Bless ye the Lord, all his hosts, ye his ministers, that execute his will. 
Bless the Lord, all his works, in all the places of his dominion; bless, O my soul, the Lord.
