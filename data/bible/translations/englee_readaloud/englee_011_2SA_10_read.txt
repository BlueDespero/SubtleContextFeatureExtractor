2 Samuel.
Chapter 10.
And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of 'Ammon died, and Chanun his son reigned in his stead. 
Then said David, I will show kindness unto Chanun the son of Nachash, as his father showed me kindness. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came unto the land of the children of 'Ammon. 
And the princes of the children of 'Ammon said unto Chanun their Lord, Doth David honor thy father in thy eyes, that he hath sent comforters unto thee! hath David not sent his servants unto thee, in order to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? 
Chanun thereupon took David's servants, and shaved off the one-half of their beard, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 
When they told it unto David, he sent persons to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed; and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beard be grown, and then return. 
And when the children of 'Ammon saw that they were become in bad odor with David, the children of 'Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rechob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand men on foot, and the king of Ma'achah with a thousand men, and of the people of Tob twelve thousand men. 
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army, and the mighty men. 
And the children of 'Ammon came out, and put themselves in battle-array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rechob, and the people of Tob and Ma'achah, were by themselves in the field. 
When now Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he selected from all the chosen men of Israel, and arrayed himself against the Syrians: 
And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, who arrayed himself against the children of 'Ammon. 
And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then shalt thou bring me help; but if the children of 'Ammon be too strong for thee, then will I go to help thee. 
Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves in behalf of our people, and in behalf of the cities of our God: and may the Lord do that which seemeth good in his eyes. 
And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians; and they fled from before him. 
And when the children of 'Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then did they also fly before Abishai, and entered into the city. Joab then returned from the children of 'Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. 
And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves altogether. 
And Hadar'ezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river, and they came to Chelam; and Shobach the captain of the army of Hadar'ezer went before them. 
And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Chelam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle-array against David, and fought with him. 
And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen; and Shobach also the captain of their army he smote, and he died there. 
And when all the kings, the vassals to Hadar'ezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them: and the Syrians feared to help the children of 'Ammon any more.
