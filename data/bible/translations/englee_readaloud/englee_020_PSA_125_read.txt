Psalms.
Chapter 125.
“A song of the degrees.” Those who trust in the Lord are like mount Zion, which will not he moved, which endureth for ever. 
Jerusalem hath mountains round about her: and so is the Lord round about his people, from this time forth and for evermore. 
For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous: in order that the righteous may not stretch forth their hands unto wrong-doing. 
Do good, O Lord, unto the good, and to those that are upright in their hearts. 
But as for those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, them will the Lord drive away with the workers of wickedness; but peace shall be upon Israel.
