Psalms.
Chapter 86.
“A prayer of David.” Incline, O Lord, thy ear, answer me; for poor and needy am I. 
Preserve my soul; for I am pious: help thy servant, O thou my God, that trusteth in thee. 
Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto thee I call all the time. 
Cause to rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift my soul. 
For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abundant in kindness unto all that call on thee. 
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
On the day of my distress will I call on thee; for thou wilt answer me. 
There is none like unto thee among the Gods, O Lord; and there is nothing like thy works. 
All the nations whom thou hast made shall come and bow themselves down before thee, O Lord; and they shall ascribe honor unto thy name. 
For great art thou, and doing wondrous things: thou art God by thyself alone. 
Teach me, O Lord, thy way; I will walk firmly in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will honor thy name for evermore. 
For thy kindness is great toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the grave of the lower world. 
O God, the presumptuous are risen up against me, and the assembly of the powerful wicked have sought after my life, and have not set thee before them. 
But thou, O Lord, art God, full of mercy, and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in kindness and truth. 
Oh turn unto me, and be gracious unto me: give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid. 
Display on me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it, and be ashamed; because thou, Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.
