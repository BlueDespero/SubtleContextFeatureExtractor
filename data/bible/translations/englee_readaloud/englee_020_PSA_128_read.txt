Psalms.
Chapter 128.
“A song of the degrees.” Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. 
When thou eatest the labor of thy hands: then wilt thou be happy, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife is then as a fruitful vine in the recesses of thy house: thy children, like olive-plants round about thy table. 
Behold, truly thus shall be blessed the man that feareth the Lord. 
May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: and see thou the happiness of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
And see thou thy children's children: may there be peace upon Israel.
