Psalms.
Chapter 5.
“To the chief musician upon Nechiloth, a psalm of David.” (5:2) To my words give ear, O Lord, have regard to my mediation. 
(5:3) Listen unto the voice of my loud cry, my King, and my God, when unto thee I pray. 
(5:4) O Lord! in the morning do thou hear my voice: in the morning will I set in order my prayer before thee, and 1ook up with hope. 
(5:5) For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: evil cannot abide with thee. 
(5:6) The arrogant cannot stand up before thy eyes: thou hatest all workers of wickedness. 
(5:7) Thou wilt destroy those that speak lies: the man of blood and deceit the Lord abhorreth. 
(5:8) But as for me—in the abundance of thy kindness will I enter thy house: I will bow myself down before thy holy temple in the fear of thee. 
(5:9) O Lord, lead me in thy righteousness because of those that regard me enviously; make straight before me thy way. 
(5:10) For there is not in their mouth any sincerity; their inward part is full of deception; an open sepulchre is their throat: they flatter with their tongue. 
(5:11) Condemn them, O God: let them fall through their own counsels; for the multitude of their transgressions cast them down; for they have rebelled against thee. 
(5:12) Then will rejoice all those that put their trust in thee; for ever will they shout for joy, when thou protectest them: and then will exult in thee those that love thy name. 
(5:13) For thou wilt bless the righteous, O Lord; as with a shield wilt thou encompass him with favor.
