Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 5.
(4:17) Watch thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be near to hearken to his will, more than to give the sacrifice of fools; for they consider not that they do evil to themselves. 
(5:1) Suffer not thy mouth to be rash, and let thy heart not be hasty to utter any word before God; for God is in the heavens, and thou art upon the earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
(5:2) For a dream cometh through being much employed with something, and the voice of a fool cometh with a multitude of words. 
(5:3) When thou makest a vow unto God, do not delay to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in such fools: that which thou hast vowed must thou pay. 
(5:4) It is better that thou shouldst not vow, than that thou shouldst vow and not pay. 
(5:5) Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy body to sin; and say thou not before the messenger, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry because of thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? 
(5:6) For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are also many words; but rather fear thou God. 
(5:7) If thou see the oppression of the poor, and violence done to justice and righteousness in a province, do not feel astounded at the matter; for one that is high watcheth over the high; and over them, the highest Power. 
(5:8) But the advantage of a land in all things is, a king who is subject to the country. 
(5:9) He that loveth money will never be satisfied with money; nor he that loveth abundance, with any increase. Also this is vanity. 
(5:10) When prosperity increaseth, those that consume it likewise increase: and what advantage is there to its owner, saving to see it with his eyes? 
(5:11) Sweet is the sleep of the laboring man, whether he eat little or much; but the overabundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 
(5:12) There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches reserved for their owner to his own hurt. 
(5:13) And these riches are lost through an unfortunate event; and he begetteth a son, and hath not the least in his hand: 
(5:14) As he came forth out of his mother's womb, naked will he return to go as he came; and not the least will he carry off for his toil, which he might take away with him. 
(5:15) And also this is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so must he go: and what profit hath he that hath toiled for the wind? 
(5:16) All his days also had he to eat in darkness, and hath had much vexation and wrath with his sickness. 
(5:17) Behold, what I have truly seen as a good thing, that it is fitting to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all one's toil that he taketh under the sun the number of the days of his life, which God hath given him; for this is his portion. 
(5:18) Also every man to whom God hath given riches and property, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his toil— this is the gift of God. 
(5:19) Let him then remember, that the days of his life are not many, that God hath answered him with the joy of his heart.
