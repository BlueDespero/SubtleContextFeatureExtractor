Numbers.
Chapter 7.
And it came to pass on the day that Moses had finally set up the tabernacle, and had anointed, and sanctified it, and all its vessels, as also the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed them, and sanctified them: 
That the princes of Israel, the heads of their family divisions, who were the princes of the tribes, the same who had superintended the numbering, offered. 
And they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two princes, and an ox for each one: and they presented them before the tabernacle. 
And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, 
Take it from them, that they may be used to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 
And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
Two of the wagons and four of the oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
And four of the wagons and eight of the oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the supervision of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 
But unto the sons of Kehath he gave none; because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them, they were to bear upon their shoulders. 
The princes also offered for the dedicating of the altar on the day that it was anointed; and the princes presented their offering before the altar. 
And the Lord said unto Moses, One prince each on a given day, shall they offer their offering, for the dedication of the altar.
