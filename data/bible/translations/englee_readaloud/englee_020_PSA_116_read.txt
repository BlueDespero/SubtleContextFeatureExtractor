Psalms.
Chapter 116.
It is lovely to me that the Lord heareth my voice, my supplications. 
For he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore throughout all my days will I call on him. 
The bands of death had compassed me, and the pangs of the nether world had overtaken me; I had met with distress and sorrow: 
I then called on the name of the Lord, I beseech thee, O Lord, release my soul. 
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; and our God is merciful. 
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me. 
Return, O my soul, unto thy rest; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling. 
I will walk before the Lord in the land of life. 
I believe, therefore will I speak: I was greatly afflicted; 
I indeed said in my despondency, Every man is a liar. 
What shall I give in return unto the Lord for all his bounties toward me? 
The cup of salvation will I lift up, and on the name of the Lord will I call. 
My vows will I pay unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people. 
Grievous in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his pious ones. 
O Lord, truly am I thy servant, I am thy servant,—the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosened my fetters. 
Unto thee will I offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of the Lord will I call. 
My vows will I pay unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people, 
In the courts of the house of the Lord, in thy midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
