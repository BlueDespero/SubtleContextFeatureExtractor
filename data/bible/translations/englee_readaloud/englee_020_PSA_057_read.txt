Psalms.
Chapter 57.
“To the chief musician, Al-tashcheth, by David, a Michtham, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.” (57:2) Be gracious unto me, O God, be gracious unto me; for in thee my soul seeketh protection, and under the shadow of thy wings will I seek protection, until the mischief be passed away. 
(57:3) I will call unto God, the Most High; unto God that accomplisheth his kindness on me. 
(57:4) He will send from heaven, and save me, though he that longeth to swallow me up utter reproach. Selah. God will send forth his kindness and his truth. 
(57:5) My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down in the midst of those that send out flames, those sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and whose tongue is a sharpened sword. 
(57:6) Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God: above all the earth let thy glory be. 
(57:7) A net have they prepared for my steps; my soul hath been bent down; they have dug before me a pit; they are fallen into the midst thereof. Selah. 
(57:8) Firm is my heart, O God, firm is my heart: I will sing and play. 
(57:9) Awake, my spirit; awake, psaltery and harp: I will wake up the morning-dawn. 
(57:10) I will thank thee among the people, O Lord: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 
(57:11) For great, even unto the heavens, is thy kindness, and even unto the skies extendeth thy truth. 
(57:12) Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God: above all the earth let thy glory be.
