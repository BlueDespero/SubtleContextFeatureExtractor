Ezekiel.
Chapter 32.
And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou didst deem thyself like a young lion among the nations: while thou art as a crocodile in the seas; and thou issuedst forth with thy rivers, and madest turbid the waters with thy feet, and didst stir up their rivers. 
Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will therefore spread out my net over thee through the assemblage of many people, and they shall draw thee up in my net. 
Then will I cast thee upon the land, upon the open field will I hurl thee, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to dwell upon thee, and I will satisfy off thee the beasts of all the earth. 
And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy carcass. 
I will also saturate the land wherein thou swimmest with thy blood, even to the mountains; and the ravines shall be full of thee. 
And I will cover up the heavens, when thou art quenched, and make their stars obscure: the sun will I cover up with a cloud, and the moon shall not let shine her light. 
All the light-dispensing lights of the heavens—these will I make obscure because of thee, and I will lay darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And I will aggrieve the heart of many people, when I bring those who are broken off from thee among the nations, into countries which thou hast not known. 
Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and on their kings the hair shall stand on end because of thee, when I brandish my sword before their faces: and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of thy downfall. 
For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The sword of the king of Babylon shall come over thee. 
By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the fiercest of nations are all of them: and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her multitude shall be annihilated. 
And I will cause to vanish all her beasts from beside the great waters; and the foot of man shall not make them turbid any more, nor shall the hoofs of beasts make them turbid. 
Then will I make clear their waters, and cause their rivers to flow like oil, saith the Lord Eternal; 
When I render the land of Egypt desolate and wasted, the country bereft of what now filleth it, when I smite all those that dwell therein: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 
This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament for her; the daughters of the nations shall lament for her: for Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament with it, saith the Lord Eternal. 
And it came to pass in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, moan for the multitude of Egypt, and say that it shall go down, yea, she, and the daughters of powerful nations, unto the land of the nether world, with those that go down to the pit. 
Whom dost thou surpass in loveliness? go down then, and be thou laid with the other uncircumcised. 
In the midst of those that are slain by the sword shall they fall: to the sword is she given up; drag her away and all her multitudes. 
Then will speak of him the strongest among the mighty out of the midst of the nether world with those that once helped him, They are gone down, there lie the uncircumcised,—slain by the sword. 
There is Asshur and all his assemblage; round about him are his graves; all of them the slain that are fallen by the sword; 
Whose graves are placed in the lowest depth of the pit, and his assemblage is round about his grave; all of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who once spread terror in the land of the living. 
There is 'Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them the slain, that are fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the land of the nether world, who once spread their terror in the land of the living; and they have borne their confusion with those that go down to the pit. 
In the midst of the slain have they set a couch for her with all her multitude; all round about are her graves; all of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because their terror was once spread in the land of the living; and they have borne their confusion with those that go down to the pit: in the midst of the slain was she placed. 
There is Meshech, Thubal, and all her multitude; all round about her are her graves: all of them are the uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because they once spread their terror in the land of the living. 
And those who are fallen of the uncircumcised shall not lie with the mighty, who are gone down to the nether world with their weapons of war, while men laid their swords under their heads, and the instruments of their iniquities were upon their bones; for the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living. 
But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with those that are slain by the sword. 
There are Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who are laid despite their prowess by those that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those that go down to the pit. 
There are the chieftains of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain: despite the terror they excited through their prowess are they made ashamed; and they lie uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword, and bear their confusion with those that go down to the pit. 
These shall Pharaoh see, and he shall be comforted over all his multitude: slain by the sword are Pharaoh and all his army, saith the Lord Eternal. 
For I spread my terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword,—yea, Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Eternal.
