Psalms.
Chapter 56.
“To the chief musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, by David, a Michtham, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.” (56:2) Be gracious unto me, O God; for man longeth to swallow me up; all the time he oppresseth me fighting. 
(56:3) Those that regard me with envy long to swallow me up all the time; for many are they that fight against me, O thou Most High. 
(56:4) The day when I am afraid, I will still trust in thee. 
(56:5) In God will I praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid: what can flesh do unto me? 
(56:6) All the day they wrest my words: against me are all their thoughts for evil. 
(56:7) They come together in troops, they hide themselves, they are those that watch my heels, as though they hoped to take my soul. 
(56:8) Because of their wrong-doing let me escape from them: in anger cast down the people, O God. 
(56:9) My wanderings hast thou well numbered: put thou my tears into thy bottle; behold, they are numbered by thee. 
(56:10) Then shall my enemies retire backward on the day when I call on thee: this I know—that God is for me. 
(56:11) In God will I praise the word: in the Lord will I praise the word. 
(56:12) In God have I put my trust; I will not be afraid: what can man do unto me? 
(56:13) Upon me, O God, rest thy vows: I will pay thanksgiving offerings unto thee. 
(56:14) For thou hast delivered my soul from death—yea, behold, my feet from slipping, that I may walk before God in the light of the life.
