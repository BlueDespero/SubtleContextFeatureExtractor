Genesis.
Chapter 4.
And the man knew Eve his wife: and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. 
And she bore again, his brother, Abel; and Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
And it came to pass in process of time, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord. 
And Abel—he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fattest thereof; and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering; 
But unto Cain and to his offering he had no respect; and it was very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance fell. 
And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou canst rule over it. 
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 
And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel they brother? and he said, I know not; am I my brother's keeper? 
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 
And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand: 
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield its strength unto thee; fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be on the earth. 
And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and if I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me. 
And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the Lord set a sign unto Cain, that any one finding him should not kill him. 
And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 
And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. 
And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begat Mechujael: and Mechujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lemech. 
And Lemech took unto himself two wives, the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle. 
And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as play on the harp and guitar. 
And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, an artificer in every article of copper and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 
And Lemech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lemech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man to my own wounding, and a young-man to my hurt. 
If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lemech seventy and seven-fold. 
And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Sheth Seth; for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 
And to Sheth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.
