Psalms.
Chapter 55.
“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a Maskil of David.” (55:2) Give ear, O God, to my prayer, and hide not thyself from my supplication. 
(55:3) Listen unto me, and answer me: I mourn in my grief, and moan; 
(55:4) Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast wrong upon me, and in wrath they attack me. 
(55:5) My heart is sorely pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. 
(55:6) Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and shuddering hath covered me. 
(55:7) And I said, Oh that some one would give me wings like a dove! I would fly away and dwell quietly. 
(55:8) Lo, I would flee far away, I would spend my night in the wilderness. Selah. 
(55:9) I would prepare hastily a refuge for me from the sweeping wind and from storm. 
(55:10) Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongue; for I have seen violence and strife in the city; 
(55:11) Day and night do these encompass it upon her walls: and wrong and trouble are in her midst. 
(55:12) Mischief is in her midst: guile and deceit depart not from her streets. 
(55:13) For it is not an enemy that reproached me; then I could bear it: not he that hateth me hath magnified himself against me; then I would have hidden myself from him; 
(55:14) But it is thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance; 
(55:15) So that we took sweet secret counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in tumultuous company. 
(55:16) Let him dispense death over them; let them go down alive into the nether world; for evil is in their dwelling, in the midst of them. 
(55:17) I, however, will call on God: and the Lord will save me. 
(55:18) At evening and morning and noon will I make my complaint and moan: and he heareth my voice.— 
(55:19) He delivereth my soul in peace from the battle against me; for in multitudes are they contending with me. 
(55:20) God will hear, and humble them—yea, he that sitteth enthroned from the oldest time Selah—those who dread no changes, and fear not God. 
(55:21) He stretcheth out his hands against those at peace with him: he violateth his covenant. 
(55:22) The creamy words of his mouth are smooth, yet there is war in his heart; his words are softer than oil, yet are they drawn swords. 
(55:23) Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
(55:24) But thou, O God, thou wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: let not the men of blood and deceit live out half their days; but I will indeed trust in thee.
