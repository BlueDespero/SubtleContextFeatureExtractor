1 Chronicles.
Chapter 23.
And when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
And then were numbered the Levites from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, of men, was thirty and eight thousand. 
Of these were twenty and four thousand to superintend the work of the house of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges; 
And four thousand were gatekeepers: and four thousand those who praised the Lord with the instruments which I have made, to praise therewith. 
And David divided them into divisions after the sons of Levi, after Gershon, Kehath, and Merari. 
Of the Gershunites: La'dan, and Shim'i. 
The sons of La'dan: The chief was Jechiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
The sons of Shim'i: Shelomith, and Chaziel, and Haran, three. These were the chiefs of the families of La'dan. 
And the sons of Shim'i were, Jachath, Zina, and Je'ush, and Beri'ah. These four were the sons of Shim'i. 
And Jachath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Je'ush and Beri'ah had not many sons: therefore were they accounted as one family division in the numbering. 
The sons of Kehath: 'Amram, Yizhar, Hebron, and 'Uzziel, four. 
The sons of 'Amram, Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was set apart, to sanctify him as most holy, he with his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. 
But as regardeth Moses the man of God, his sons were named after the tribe of Levi. 
The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eli'ezer. 
Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. 
And the sons of Eli'ezer were, Rechahyah the chief. And Eli'ezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rechahyah became exceedingly numerous. 
Of the sons of Yizhar, was Shelomith the chief. 
The sons of Hebron: Jeriyahu the chief, Amaryah the second, Jachaziel the third, and Jekam'am the fourth. 
The sons of 'Uzziel: Michah the chief, and Yishiyah the second. 
The sons of Merari: Machli, and Mushi. The sons of Machli: El'azar, and Kish. 
And El'azar died, and had no sons, but daughters; and the sons of Kish, their brethren, took them for wives. 
The sons of Mushi: Machli, and 'Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
These were the sons of Levi after their family divisions, even the chiefs of the families, as they were counted by numbering the names after their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward. 
For David said, The Lord the God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for evermore. 
And also the Levites are no more bound to carry the tabernacle, and all its vessels for the service thereof. 
Therefore by the last words of David were there numbered of the Levites those who were from twenty years old and above; 
Because their station was to be at the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and by the purification of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 
And for the shew-bread, which was put in rows, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is sodden, and for all manner of dry and wet measure; 
And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and so also at evening, 
And at all the offering of burnt-offerings unto the Lord on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts, according to the number, and after the manner prescribed for them, continually before the Lord; 
And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord.
