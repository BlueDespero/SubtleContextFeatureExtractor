Psalms.
Chapter 127.
“A song of the degrees for Solomon.” Unless the Lord do build the house, in vain labor they that build on it: unless the Lord guard the city, in vain is the watchman wakeful. 
It is in vain for you to be early in rising, to be late in sitting up, eating the bread of painful toils; for so doth he give unto his beloved during sleep. 
Lo, children are an inheritance from the Lord: a reward is the fruit of the body. 
Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 
Happy is the man that hath his quiver filled with them: they shall not be put to shame, when they do speak with the enemies in the gate.
