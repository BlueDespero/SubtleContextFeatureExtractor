Proverbs.
Chapter 2.
My son, if thou wouldst but accept my words, and treasure up my commandments with thee; 
To let thy ear listen unto wisdom: if thou wouldst incline thy heart to understanding. 
For if thou wilt call after intelligence; if after understanding thou wilt lift up thy voice; 
If thou wilt seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures: 
Then wilt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of God wilt thou find. 
For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 
He treasureth up sound wisdom for the righteous, as a shield to those that walk in integrity: 
That men may keep the paths of justice; and the way of his pious servants doth he guard. 
Then wilt thou understand righteousness, and justice, and equity: yea, every track of goodness. 
For wisdom will enter thy heart, and knowledge will be pleasant unto thy soul; 
Discretion will watch over thee, understanding will keep thee; 
To deliver thee from the way of the bad, from the man that speaketh perverse things; 
From those who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 
Who rejoice to do evil, who are delighted in the perverseness of the bad; 
Who as regardeth their paths are crooked, and froward in their tracks. 
To deliver thee from the adulteress, from the alien woman that useth flattering speeches; 
That forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 
For she sinketh unto death—her house, and unto the departed lead her tracks. 
All that come unto her return not again, and they will not reach the paths of life. 
In order that thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and observe the paths of the righteous. 
For the upright will dwell on the earth, and the perfect will be left remaining on it. 
But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous shall be plucked up therefrom.
