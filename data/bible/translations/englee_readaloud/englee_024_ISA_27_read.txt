Isaiah.
Chapter 27.
On that day will the Lord punish with his heavy and great and strong sword leviathan the flying serpent, and leviathan the crooked servant; and he will slay the crocodile that is in the sea. 
On that day sing ye a song of the vineyard of excellent wine. 
“I the Lord do keep it; every moment will I water it: that no one shall hurt it, night and day will I keep it. 
Wrath have I not: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would pass through them, and I would burn them altogether. 
If he but take hold of my strength, make peace with me; make peace with me.” 
In the future shall Jacob yet take root; Israel shall bud and blossom, and shall fill the face of the world with fruit. 
Hath he smitten him, as he smote the one that smote him? or was he slain with the same slaughter as those of him that were slain? 
In measure, by driving him forth, thou strivest with him: he removed him with his violent storm on the day of the east wind. 
Therefore by this only shall the iniquity of Jacob be atoned; and this shall be all the fruit of the taking away of his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as limestones that are beaten in pieces, when there shall not arise again any groves and sun-images. 
For by this the fortified city shall be desolate, the habitation be forsaken, and left like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall it lie down, and consume its branches. 
When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; women will come and set them on fire; for it is not a people of understanding; therefore he that made it will not have mercy on it, and he that formed it will show it no favor. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will beat off the fruit from the channel of the River up to the brook of Egypt; but ye shall be gathered up one by one, ye children of Israel. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, that the great cornet shall be blown, and then shall come those who are lost in the land of Asshur, and those who are outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall prostrate themselves before the Lord on the holy mount at Jerusalem.
