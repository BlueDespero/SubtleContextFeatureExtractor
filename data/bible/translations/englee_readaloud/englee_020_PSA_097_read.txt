Psalms.
Chapter 97.
The Lord reigneth: let the earth be glad; let the multitude of isles rejoice. 
Clouds and thick darkness are round about him: righteousness and justice are the support of his throne. 
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up round about his adversaries. 
His lightnings give light to the world: the earth seeth it, and trembleth. 
The mountains melt away like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth. 
The heavens tell of his righteousness, and all the people his glory. 
Made ashamed shall be all that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: unto him bow down all the gods. 
Zion heareth it, and rejoiceth; and glad are the daughters of Judah, because of thy decrees, O Lord. 
For thou, O Lord, art the most high above all the earth: thou art greatly exalted above all gods. 
Ye that love the Lord, hate ye the evil: he preserveth the souls of his pious ones; out of the hand of the wicked he ever delivereth them. 
Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. 
Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord, and give thanks to his holy memorial.
