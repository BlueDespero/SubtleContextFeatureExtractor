Zechariah.
Chapter 14.
Behold, a day is coming unto the Lord, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. 
And I will assemble all the nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into exile, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
Then will the Lord go forth, and fight against these nations, as on the day when he fought on the day of battle. 
And his feet will stand on that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall be split in twain in its middle eastward and westward, making a very great valley; and half of the mount shall remove northward, and half of it southward. 
And ye shall flee from the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal; and ye shall flee, just as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of 'Uzziyah the king of Judah: and then will come the Lord my God, and all the saints with thee. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, that there shall be no light, but fleeting light and thick darkness; 
But it shall be one particular day which shall indeed be known as the Lord's, neither day nor night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening-time there shall be light. 
And it shall happen on that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, the half of them toward the eastern sea, and the other half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be so. 
And the Lord will be king over all the earth: on that day shall the Lord be acknowledged one, and his name be one. 
All the land shall be changed as it were into a plain from Geba' to Rimmon to the south of Jerusalem; and she herself shall be elevated, and be inhabited on her former site, from the gate of Benjamin unto the place of the first gate, up to the corner gate, and from the tower of Chananel unto the king's wine-presses. 
And men shall dwell in it, and no destruction shall any more take place; but Jerusalem shall be inhabited in safety. 
And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will afflict all the people that shall have come to battle against Jerusalem: The flesh of every one shall consume away while he standeth upon his feet, and his eyes shall consume away in their holes, and the tongue of every one shall consume away in his mouth. 
And it shall come to pass on that day, that a great confusion from the Lord shall be among them: and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor. 
And also Judah will have to fight against Jerusalem: and there shall be gathered together the wealth of all the nations round about, gold, and silver, and garments, in great abundance. 
And thus shall be the plague of the horses, of the mules, of the camels, and of the asses, and of all the beasts that will be in these camps, just like this plague. 
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left out of all the nations who will have come against Jerusalem, yea, these shall go up year by year to bow down before the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles. 
And it shall happen, that whoso will not come up out of the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to bow down before the King, the Lord of hosts,—even upon these there shall be no rain. 
And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, then shall not any rain fall upon them also: this shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will afflict the nations that will not come up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles. 
This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that will not come up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles. 
On that day shall every thing, even to the bells of the horses, be holy unto the Lord; and the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar. 
And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto the Lord of hosts; and all those that sacrifice will come and take some of them, and seethe therein: and on that day there shall be no more any trader in the house of the Lord of host.
