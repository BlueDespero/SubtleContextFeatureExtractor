Daniel.
Chapter 6.
(6:2) Darius deemed it proper, and he set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty lieutenants, who should be over all the kingdom; 
(6:3) And over these, three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these lieutenants should give accounts unto them, so that the king might suffer no damage. 
(6:4) Then did this Daniel excel all the presidents and lieutenants, because a superior spirit was in him: and the king thought to appoint him over the whole kingdom. 
(6:5) Then sought the presidents and lieutenants to find a pretext against Daniel on account of the management of the kingdom; but they were not able to find any pretext or fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, and no kind of error or fault was to be found on him. 
(6:6) Then said these men, We shall not find any pretext against this Daniel, except we find it against him in the law of his God. 
(6:7) Then came these presidents and lieutenants tumultuously to the king, and thus said they unto him, King Darius, live for ever. 
(6:8) All the presidents of the kingdom, the superintendents, and the lieutenants, the counsellors, and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm prohibition, that whosoever will ask any thing by prayer of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. 
(6:9) Now, O king, establish the prohibition, and sign the writing, that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which is not to be repealed. 
(6:10) In view of this king Darius signed the writing and the prohibition. 
(6:11) Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went up unto his house, where he had open windows in his upper chamber in the direction of Jerusalem; and three times every day he kneeled upon his knees, and prayed, and offered thanks before his God, as he had been doing before that time. 
(6:12) Then came in these men tumultuously, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. 
(6:13) Then came they near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's prohibition, Hast thou not signed a prohibition, that every man that will pray for aught of any God or man, within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is certainly so, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot he repealed. 
(6:14) Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the exiles of Judah, hath paid no regard to thee, O king, nor to the prohibition which thou hast signed; but three times every day he offereth up his prayer. 
(6:15) Then the king, when he heard this matter, felt very much distressed within himself, and on account of Daniel he sought an excuse to deliver him; and till the going down of the sun he strove hard to rescue him. 
(6:16) Then came these men tumultuously unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians. That every prohibition and statute which the king hath established is not to be changed. 
(6:17) Then gave the king the order, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king commenced and said unto Daniel, May thy God whom thou worshippest continually, truly deliver thee. 
(6:18) And a stone was brought, and placed upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet-ring, and with the signet-ring of his lords, that nothing should be changed in the purpose concerning Daniel. 
(6:19) Then went the king to his palace, and passed the night fasting: and no food was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him. 
(6:20) Then arose the king by the morning-dawn, as soon as it was light, and went in great haste unto the den of lions. 
(6:21) And when he came near to the den, he cried with a mournful voice unto Daniel: the king commenced and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou worshippest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions! 
(6:22) Then spoke Daniel with the king, O king, live for ever. 
(6:23) My God sent his angel, and locked up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, had I done nothing injurious. 
(6:24) Then was the king exceedingly glad within himself, and concerning Daniel he ordered to bring him up out of the den. So was Daniel brought up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God. 
(6:25) And the king gave the order, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel treacherously, and they cast into the den of lions them, their children, and their wives; and they had not yet touched the bottom of the den when the lions had the mastery over them, and ground up all their bones. 
(6:26) Then wrote king Darius unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell on all the earth, May your welfare increase. 
(6:27) From me is it decreed, That in all the dominion of my kingdom men shall tremble and have fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and endureth for ever, and it is his kingdom which will not be destroyed, and his dominion will be unto the end of things. 
(6:28) He delivereth and rescueth, and he displayeth sings and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 
(6:29) So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
