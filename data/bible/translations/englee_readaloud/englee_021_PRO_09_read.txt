Proverbs.
Chapter 9.
Wisdom hath built her house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars; 
She hath killed her cattle; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also set in order her table. 
She hath sent forth her maidens: she inviteth her guests upon the top of the highest places of the town. 
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that is void of sense, she saith to him, 
“Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. 
Forsake simplicity, and live; and go onward on the way of understanding. 
He that correcteth a scorner acquireth for himself abuse; and he that reproveth the wicked getteth himself a blemish. 
Do not correct a scorner, lest he hate thee: reprove a wise man, and he will love thee. 
Give to the wise instruction, and he will become yet wiser: impart knowledge to the righteous, and he will increase his information. 
The commencement of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; and the knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding. 
For through me shall thy days be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased unto thee. 
If thou art become wise, thou art wise for thyself; but if thou art a scorner, thou alone wilt have to bear it.” 
The woman of folly is noisy: she is simple, and knoweth not what to do. 
And she sitteth at the door of her house, upon a chair in the high places of the town. 
To call the wayfarers who go straight forward on their paths. 
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; and as for him that is void of sense, she saith to him, 
“Stolen waters are sweet, and bread of secrecy is pleasant.” 
But he knoweth not that the departed are there; that in the depths of the nether world are her guests.
