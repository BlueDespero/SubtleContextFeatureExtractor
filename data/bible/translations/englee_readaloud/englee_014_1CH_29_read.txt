1 Chronicles.
Chapter 29.
And king David said unto all the assembly, Solomon, the only son of mine whom God hath made choice of, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; because not for man is the palace to be, but for the Lord God. 
But with all my might have I made ready for the house of my God, the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the copper for the things of copper, the iron for the things of iron, and the wood for the things of wood, onyx stones, and stones to be set, bright stones, and stones of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, have I acquired as my own property gold and silver; and this have I given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house: 
Three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; 
All that is needed of gold and of silver, and for every manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who now is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto the Lord? 
Thereupon offered voluntarily the chiefs of the family divisions and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, with the supervisors of the king's work; 
And they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drachms, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of copper eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents. 
And those with whom stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, under the supervision of Jechiel the Gershunite. 
Then did the people rejoice, because they had voluntarily offered: for with an undivided heart did they offer to the Lord: and also king David rejoiced with great joy. 
And David blessed the Lord before the eyes of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Lord the God of Israel our father, from everlasting even unto everlasting. 
Thine, O Lord, are the greatness, and the might, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, yea, all that is in the heavens and on the earth: thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and thou art exalted as the head above all. 
And riches and honor come from thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand are power and might; and it is in thy hand to make great, and to give strength unto all. 
And now, O our God, we give thanks unto thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
For who am I, and what is my people, that we should possess the power to offer voluntarily after this sort? for from thee is every thing, and out of thy own have we given unto thee. 
For strangers are we before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: like a shadow are our days on the earth, and there is no hope of abiding. 
O Lord our God! all this abundant store which we have prepared to build for thee a house for thy holy name, is out of thy own hand, and thine is all. 
And I know, my God, that thou probest the heart, and uprightness thou receivest in favor. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart have I voluntarily offered all these things; and now thy people, that are present here, do I see with joy offering voluntarily unto thee. 
O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our father, preserve this for ever as the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart firmly unto thee. 
And unto Solomon my son do thou give an undivided heart to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all, and to build the palace, for which I have made preparation. 
And David said to all the assembly. Bless now the Lord your God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers, and bent down their heads, and prostrated themselves to the Lord, and to the king. 
And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and they offered burnt-offerings unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, one thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand sheep, with their drink-offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel; 
And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great joy. And they declared the second time Solomon the son of David to be king, and they anointed him unto the Lord as chief ruler, and Zadok as priest. 
Then sat Solomon on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he was prosperous; and all Israel obeyed him. 
And all the princes, and the mighty men, and also all the sons of king David, submitted themselves unto king Solomon. 
And the Lord made Solomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all Israel; and he bestowed upon him a royal majesty such as had not been on any king over Israel before him. 
Thus did David the son of Jesse reign over all Israel. 
And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years. 
And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son became king in his stead. 
And the acts of king David, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 
Together with all his reign and his mighty deeds, and the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the various countries.
