Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 113.
Halleluyah ·praise Yah·! Praise, you servants of Adonai , praise Adonai ’s name. 
Blessed be Adonai ’s name, from this time forward and forever more. 
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, Adonai ’s name is to be praised. 
Adonai is high above all nations, his kavod ·weighty glory· above the heavens. 
Who is like Adonai , our God, who has his seat on high, 
Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth? 
He raises up the poor out of the dust. Lifts up the needy from the ash heap; 
that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 
He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother of children. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
