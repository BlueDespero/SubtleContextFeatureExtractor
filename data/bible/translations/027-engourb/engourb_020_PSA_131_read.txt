Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 131.
Adonai , my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me. 
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 
Israel God prevails, hope in Adonai , from this time forward and forever more.
