Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 114.
When Israel God prevails went out of Egypt Abode of slavery, the house of Jacob Supplanter from a people of foreign language; 
Judah Praised became his sanctuary, Israel God prevails his dominion. 
The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan Descender was driven back. 
The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. 
What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan Descender, that you turned back? 
You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills, like lambs? 
Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob Supplanter, 
who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
