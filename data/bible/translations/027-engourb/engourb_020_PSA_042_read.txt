Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 42.
As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God. 
My soul thirsts for God, for the Elohim Chayim Living God. When shall I come and appear before God? 
My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” 
These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day. 
Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him for the yishu'ah ·salvation· of his presence. 
My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan Descender, the heights of Hermon Devoted to destruction, from the hill Mizar. 
Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me. 
Adonai will enjoin his cheshed ·loving-kindness· in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life. 
I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” 
As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” 
Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to him, the yishu'ah ·salvation· of my countenance, and my God.
