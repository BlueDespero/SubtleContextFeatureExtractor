Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 34.
I will bless Adonai at all times. His tehilah ·praise song· will always be in my mouth. 
My soul shall boast in Adonai . The humble shall sh'ma ·hear obey· it, and be glad. 
Oh magnify Adonai with me. Let us exalt his name together. 
I sought Adonai , and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 
They looked to him, and were radiant. Their faces shall never be covered with shame. 
This poor man cried, and Adonai sh'ma ·heard obeyed· him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 
Ha mal'ak Yahweh The Angel of He sustains breathing encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. 
Oh taste and see that Adonai is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. 
Oh fear Adonai , you his saints, for there is no lack with those who fear him. 
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek Adonai shall not lack any good thing. 
Come, you children, sh'ma ·hear obey· unto me. I will teach you the fear of Adonai . 
Who of you takes pleasure in living? Who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· a long life to see good things? 
If you do, keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from deceiving talk; 
turn from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and fervently pursue it! 
For Adonai ’s eyes are toward the upright. His ears listen to their prayers. 
But Adonai ’s face is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth. 
The upright cry, and Adonai sh'ma ·hears obeys·, and delivers them out of all their troubles. 
Adonai is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit. 
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Adonai delivers him out of them all. 
He protects all of his bones. Not one of them is broken. 
Evil shall kill the wicked. Those who hate the upright shall be condemned. 
Adonai redeems the soul of his servants. None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.
