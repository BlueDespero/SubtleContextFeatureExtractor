Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 48.
Great is Adonai , and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, on the north sides, the city of the great King. 
In its citadels God has revealed himself as a strong defense. 
For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together. 
They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed. They hurried away. 
Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail. 
With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish. 
As we have sh'ma ·heard obeyed·, so we have seen, in the city of Adonai Tzva'ot Yahweh Commander of heaven’s armies, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
We have thought about your cheshed ·loving-kindness·, God, in the middle of your temple. 
As is your name, God, so is your tehilah ·praise song· to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness. 
Let Mount Zion Mountain ridge, Marking be glad! Let the daughters of Judah Praised rejoice, Because of your judgments. 
Walk about Zion Mountain ridge, Marking, and go around her. Number its towers. 
Mark well her bulwarks. Consider her palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation. 
For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.
