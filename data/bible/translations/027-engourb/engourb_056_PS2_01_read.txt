Psalms 151 [Praises].
Chapter 1.
I was small among my brothers, and youngest in my father’s house. I tended my father’s sheep. 
My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a lute. 
Who shall tell adonai ·my Lord·? Adonai himself, he himself hears. 
He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep, and he anointed me with his anointing oil. 
My brothers were handsome and tall; but Adonai did not take pleasure in them. 
I went out to meet the Philistine To roll in dust (As an insult), and he cursed me by his idols. 
But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel God prevails.
