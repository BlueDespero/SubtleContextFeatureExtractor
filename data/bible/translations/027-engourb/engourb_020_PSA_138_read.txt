Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 138.
I will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to with my whole heart. Before the deities, I will sing zahmar ·musical praise· to you. 
I will bow down toward your holy temple, and yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your Name for your cheshed ·loving-kindness· and for your truth; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all. 
In the day that I called, you answered me. You encouraged me with strength in my soul. 
All the kings of the earth will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai , for they have sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the words of your mouth. 
Yes, they will sing of the ways of Adonai ; for great is the kavod Yahweh ·weighty glory of He sustains breathing·. 
For though Adonai is high, yet he looks after the lowly; but the proud, he knows from afar. 
Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me. You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will save me. 
Adonai will fulfill that which concerns me; your cheshed ·loving-kindness·, Adonai , endures forever. Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.
