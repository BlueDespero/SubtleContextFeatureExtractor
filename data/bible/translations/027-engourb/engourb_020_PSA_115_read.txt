Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 115.
Not to us, Adonai , not to us, but to your name give kavod ·weighty glory·, for your cheshed ·loving-kindness·, and for your truth’s sake. 
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God, now?” 
But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases. 
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. 
They have mouths, but they don’t speak. They have eyes, but they don’t see. 
They have ears, but they don’t sh'ma ·hear obey·. They have noses, but they don’t smell. 
They have hands, but they don’t feel. They have feet, but they don’t walk, neither do they speak through their throat. 
Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them. 
Israel God prevails, trust in Adonai ! He is their help and their shield. 
House of Aaron Light-bringer, trust in Adonai ! He is their help and their shield. 
You who fear Adonai , trust in Adonai ! He is their help and their shield. 
Adonai remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel God prevails. He will bless the house of Aaron Light-bringer. 
He will bless those who fear Adonai , both small and great. 
May Adonai increase you more and more, you and your children. 
Blessed are you by Adonai , who made heaven and earth. 
The heavens are the heavens of Adonai ; but the earth has he given to the children of men. 
The dead don’t Halleluyah ·praise Yah·, neither any who go down into silence; 
But we will bless Yah, from this time forward and forever more. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
