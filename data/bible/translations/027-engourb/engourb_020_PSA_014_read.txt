Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 14.
The fool has said in his heart, “There is no Elohim ·Deity, Judge· .” They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good. 
Adonai looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God. 
All have gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is no one who does good, no, not one. 
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don’t call on Adonai ? 
There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the upright. 
You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Adonai is his refuge. 
Oh that the yishu'ah ·salvation· of Israel God prevails would come out of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking! When Adonai restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob Supplanter shall rejoice, and Israel God prevails shall be glad.
