Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 13.
How long, Adonai ? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me? 
Behold, and answer me, Adonai , my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall. 
But I trust in your cheshed ·loving-kindness·. My heart rejoices in your yishu'ah ·salvation·. 
I will sing to Adonai , because he has been good to me.
