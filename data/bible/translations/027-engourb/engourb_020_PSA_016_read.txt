Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 16.
Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge. 
My soul, you have said to Adonai , “You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing.” 
As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight. 
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another deity. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips. 
Adonai assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure. 
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance. 
I will bless Adonai , who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons. 
I always set Adonai before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
Therefore my heart is glad, and my kavod ·weighty glory· rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety. 
For you will not leave my soul in Sheol ·Place of the dead·, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption. 
You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.
