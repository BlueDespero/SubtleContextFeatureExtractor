Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 149.
Praise Adonai ! Sing to Adonai a new song, his tehilah ·praise song· in the assembly of the saints. 
Let Israel God prevails rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion Mountain ridge, Marking be joyful in their King. 
Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing zahmar ·musical praise· to him with tambourine and harp! 
For Adonai takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with yishu'ah ·salvation·. 
Let the saints rejoice in kavod ·weighty glory·. Let them sing for joy on their beds. 
May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples; 
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
to execute on them the written judgment. All his saints have this honor. Halleluyah ·praise Yah·!
