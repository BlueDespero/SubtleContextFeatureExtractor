Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 67.
May God be merciful to us, bless us, and cause his face to shine on us. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
That your way may be known on earth, and your yishu'ah ·salvation· among all nations, 
let the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, God. Let all the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you. 
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Let the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you, God. Let all the peoples yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you. 
The earth has yielded its increase. God, even our own God, will bless us. 
God will bless us. All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
