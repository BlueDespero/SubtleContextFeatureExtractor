Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 140.
Deliver me, Adonai , from the evil man. Preserve me from the violent man; 
those who devise mischief in their hearts. They continually gather themselves together for war. 
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. Viper’s poison is under their lips. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
Adonai , keep me from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet. 
The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for me. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
I said to Adonai , “You are my God.” Listen to the cry of my petitions, Adonai . 
Adonai , the Lord, the strength of my yishu'ah ·salvation·, you have covered my head in the day of battle. 
Adonai , don’t grant the desires of the wicked. Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah ·contemplation with musical interlude·. 
As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise. 
An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 
I know that Adonai will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and mishpat ·justice· for the needy. 
Surely the upright will yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence.
