Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 97.
Adonai reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of islands be glad! 
Clouds and darkness are around him. Righteousness and mishpat ·justice· are the foundation of his throne. 
A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side. 
His lightning lights up the world. The earth sees, and trembles. 
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Adonai , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
The heavens declare his righteousness. All the peoples have seen his kavod ·weighty glory·. 
Let all them be shamed who abad ·serve· engraved images, who boast in their idols. Hawa ·Bow low, prostrate· to worship him, all you angels! 
Zion Mountain ridge, Marking sh'ma ·heard obeyed· and was glad. The daughters of Judah Praised rejoiced, because of your judgments, Adonai . 
For you, Adonai , are most high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all deities. 
You who 'ahav ·affectionately love· Adonai , hate evil. He preserves the souls of his saints. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. 
Light is sown for the upright, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
Be glad in Adonai , you upright people! Yadah ·Extend hands in thankful praise· to his holy Name.
