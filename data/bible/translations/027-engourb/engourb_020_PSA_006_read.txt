Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 6.
Adonai , don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath. 
Have mercy on me, Adonai , for I am faint. Adonai , heal me, for my bones are troubled. 
My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Adonai, how long? 
Teshuvah ·Completely return·, Adonai . Deliver my soul, and save me for your cheshed ·loving-kindness’· sake. 
For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol ·Place of the dead·, who shall yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to you? 
I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears. 
My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries. 
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Adonai has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· the voice of my weeping. 
Adonai has sh'ma ·heard obeyed· my supplication. Adonai accepts my prayer. 
May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
