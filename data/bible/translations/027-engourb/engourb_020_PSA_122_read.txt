Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 122.
I was glad when they said to me, “Let’s go to Adonai ’s house!” 
Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem City of peace; 
Jerusalem City of peace, that is built as a city that is compact together; 
where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes, according to a testimony for Israel God prevails, yadah ·extend hands in thankful praise· to Adonai ’s name. 
For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of David Beloved’s house. 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem City of peace. Those who 'ahav ·affectionately love· you will prosper. 
Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces. 
For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes, I will now say, “Peace be within you.” 
For the sake of the house of Yahweh Eloheikhem Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
