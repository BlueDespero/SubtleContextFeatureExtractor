Psalms [Praises].
Chapter 11.
In Adonai , I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!” 
For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the upright do? 
Adonai is in his holy temple. Adonai is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men. 
Adonai examines the upright, but the wicked and him who 'ahav ·affectionately loves· violence his soul hates. 
On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 
For Adonai is righteous. He 'ahav ·affectionately loves· righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
