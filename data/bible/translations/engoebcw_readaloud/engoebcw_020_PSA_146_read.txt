Psalms.
Chapter 146.
My soul, praise the Lord. 
I will praise the Lord, while I live; I will sing to my God, while I am. 
Put not your trust in princes mortals, in whom is no help. 
When their breath goes out, they go back to the dust: on that very day their purposes perish. 
Happy those whose help is the God of Jacob: whose hope is set on the Lord their God, 
the Creator of heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them. He remains eternally loyal. 
For the wronged he executes justice; he gives bread to the hungry; the Lord releases the prisoners. 
The Lord gives sight to the blind: the Lord raises those who are bowed. The Lord loves the righteous. 
The Lord preserves the stranger, upholds the widow and orphan, but the wicked he leads to disaster. 
The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Hallelujah.
