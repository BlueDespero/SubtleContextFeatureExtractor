Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A song of ascents. Happy all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways. 
You will eat what your hands have toiled for, and be happy and prosperous! 
Like a fruitful vine shall your wife be in the innermost room of your house: your children, like olive shoots, round about your table. 
See! This is the blessing of the man who fears the Lord. 
The Lord shall bless you from Zion. You will see Jerusalem nourish all the days of your life. 
You will see your children's children. Peace upon Israel.
