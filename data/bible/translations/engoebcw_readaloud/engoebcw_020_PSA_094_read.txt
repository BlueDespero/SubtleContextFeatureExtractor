Psalms.
Chapter 94.
Lord, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, shine forth. 
Rise up, judge of the earth, pay back the proud what they deserve. 
Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult, 
with their blustering arrogant words, their braggart and wicked speech, 
crushing your people, Lord, and afflicting your heritage, 
murdering widows and strangers, slaying the fatherless? 
They think that the Lord does not see, nor the God of Jacob regard it. 
Take heed, you dullest of people; when will you be wise, you fools? 
Is he deaf, who shaped the ear? Is he blind, who fashioned the eye? 
Can he who trains nations not punish them he who teaches knowledge to people? 
The Lord knows the thoughts of people, that only a breath are they. 
Happy are those whom you chasten, and teach out of your law, 
keeping them calm in the day of misfortune, till a pit be dug for the wicked. 
For the Lord will not leave his people, he will not forsake his inheritance. 
For the righteous shall come to their rights, and all true-hearted people shall follow them. 
Who will rise up for me against those who do evil? Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong? 
Were it not for the help of the Lord, I would soon have gone to the silent grave. 
When I thought that my foot was slipping, your kindness, Lord, held me up. 
When with cares my heart was crowded, your comforts make me glad. 
Can corrupt justice be your ally, framing mischief by statute? 
They assail the life of the righteous, and innocent blood condemn. 
But the Lord is my sure retreat, my God is the rock of my refuge. 
He will bring back their sin upon them, for their wickedness he will destroy them; the Lord our God will destroy them.
