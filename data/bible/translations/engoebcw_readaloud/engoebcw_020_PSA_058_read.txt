Psalms.
Chapter 58.
For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam. Do you speak what is right, you gods? With equity judge you your people? 
In the land you practise iniquity — all of you; violence do you dispense with your hands. 
The wicked go astray from the womb liars take the wrong path from their birth. 
Venom have they like the venom of snakes, they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears, 
and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer, or binder of spells, no matter how cunning. 
O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth, tear out the great teeth of the young lions, Lord. 
May they melt away like running water! Like tender grass, cut down may they be! 
Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path, like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight. 
Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots, he will come with his tempest and sweep them away. 
The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous; their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked. 
People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded: yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.”
