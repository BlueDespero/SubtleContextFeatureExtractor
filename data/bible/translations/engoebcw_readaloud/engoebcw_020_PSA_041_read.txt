Psalms.
Chapter 41.
For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David. Happy are those who consider the weak; in the day of misfortune the Lord will deliver them. 
He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land, and not give them up to the rage of their foes. 
The Lord will sustain them on bed of languishing; tending their sickness, as long as they lie. 
For this cause I say, “Lord, show me your favour; heal me, because I have sinned against you.” 
My enemies speak of me nothing but evil, “When will he die, and his name pass away?” 
When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow; their heart keeps gathering mischief the while; and when they go out, they give it speech. 
In secret they whisper together against me, all those who hate me plot evil against me. 
“Some fatal disease has fastened upon him; and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.” 
My most trusted friend, on whom I relied, who ate of my bread, has turned against me. 
But do you, Lord, graciously raise me up, that I may pay them their due reward. 
By this will I know you delight in me: if my foes may not shout over me in triumph. 
For my innocence you uphold me, and set me forever before your face. 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting, Amen and Amen.
