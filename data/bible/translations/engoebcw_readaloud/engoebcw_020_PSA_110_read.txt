Psalms.
Chapter 110.
Of David, a psalm. This said the Lord concerning my lord, “Sit at my right hand, till I set your foot on the neck of your foes.” 
On Zion the Lord is wielding your sceptre of might, and charges you to rule over the foes that surround you. 
The day that you march to battle your people will follow you gladly young warriors in holy array, like dew-drops, born of the morning. 
The Lord has sworn and will not repent, “As for you, you are priest for ever as Melchizedek was.” 
By your side will the Lord shatter kings on the day of his wrath. 
He will execute judgement filling the valleys with dead, the broad fields with shattered heads. 
He will drink of the brook by the way, and march onward with uplifted head.
