Psalms.
Chapter 32.
Of David. A maskil. Happy those whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered. 
Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit, to whom the Lord reckons no debt of guilt. 
When I held my peace, my bones wore away with my endless groaning; 
for day and night did your hand lie heavy upon me. The sap of my life was dried up as with fierce summer-heat. Selah 
I began to acknowledge my sin, not concealing my guilt; and the moment I vowed to confess to the Lord my transgression, then you yourself did pardon the guilt of my sin. Selah 
For this cause let all who are faithful pray to you in the time of distress; then, when the great waters rush, they will not reach to him. 
For you are my shelter, you protect me from trouble, and surround me with deliverance. Selah 
“With my eye steadfastly upon you, I will instruct and teach you The way you should go. 
Do not be like the horse or the mule, that have no understanding, but need bridle and halter to curb them, else they will not come near to you.” 
The godless have many sorrows, but those who trust in the Lord will be compassed about by his kindness. 
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you righteous; and ring out your joy, all you upright in heart.
