Malachi.
Chapter 4.
“The day is coming that will burn like a furnace, and all the proud and all evildoers will be stubble, and the day that is coming will burn them up,” says the Lord of hosts, “leaving neither root nor branch. 
But to you who revere my name there will arise the sun of righteousness with healing in its wings, and you will run free like calves let out from their stall. 
In the day when I act you will tread down the wicked, they will be as ashes under the soles of your feet,” says the Lord of hosts. 
“Remember the law of Moses my servant, statutes and judgements which I gave him at Horeb for all Israel. 
I am about to send to you Elijah the prophet, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. 
He will turn fathers' hearts to their sons and sons' hearts to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgement.”
