Psalms.
Chapter 95.
O come, let us sing to the LORD; Let us raise a voice of joy to the rock of our salvation! 
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving, And sing joyfully to him with psalms! 
For Jehovah is a great God; Yea, a great king over all gods. 
In his hands are the depths of the earth; His also are the heights of the mountains. 
The sea is his, and he made it; The dry land also his hands formed. 
O come, let us worship and bow down! Let us kneel before the LORD, our maker! 
For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture and the flock of his hand. O that ye would now hear his voice! 
“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah the strife, As in the day of temptation Massah in the wilderness, 
Where your fathers tempted me And tried me, although they had seen my works. 
Forty years was I offended with that generation: And I said, 'They are a people of a perverse heart, And who have no regard to my ways.' 
Therefore I sware, in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.”
