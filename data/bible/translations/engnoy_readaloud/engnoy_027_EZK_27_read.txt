Ezekiel.
Chapter 27.
The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying: 
Son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre, 
and say to Tyre, O thou that didst dwell at the entrance of the sea, the merchant of the nations to many coasts! thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, thou hast said, “I am perfect in beauty.” 
Thy borders are in the midst of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty. 
They made all thy ship-boards of cypresses of Senir; they took cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 
Of oaks of Bashan they made thine oars; thy benches they made of ivory inlaid in cedar from the coasts of the Chittaeans. 
Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou didst spread forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the coasts of Elisha were thy covering. 
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, were thy pilots. 
The ancients of Gebal and the skilful men thereof were in thee, thy calkers; all the ships of the sea, with their mariners, were in thee, to traffic in thy merchandise. 
Persians, and Lydians, and Lybians were in thine army, thy men of war; they hung up the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy glory. 
The men of Arvad and thine own army were upon thy walls round about, and brave warriors were in thy towers; they hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they made thy beauty perfect. 
Tarshish trafficked with thee on account of the abundance of all kinds of goods; with silver, iron, tin, and lead they traded in thy fairs. 
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech trafficked with thee; the persons of men and vessels of brass they sold in thy market. 
They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 
The men of Dedan trafficked with thee; many islands were at hand to thee for trade; they brought thee, for payment, horns of ivory, and ebony-wood. 
Syria trafficked with thee by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making; with carbuncles, purple and embroidered work, and fine linen, and corals, and rubies, they traded in thy fairs. 
Judah and the land of Israel trafficked with thee; with wheat of Minnith, and pastry, and syrup, and oil, and balm they traded in thy market. 
Damascus trafficked with thee on account of the multitude of the wares of thy making, on account of the abundance of all kinds of goods, in the wine of Helbon, and in white wool. 
Vedan and Javan brought thread to thy market; wrought iron, cassia, and sweet reed were in thy fairs. 
Dedan brought cloth for riding, in traffic with thee. 
Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were at hand to traffic with thee; they traded with thee in lambs and rams and goats. 
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah trafficked with thee with all kinds of precious spices, and with all kinds of precious stones, and gold. 
Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assyria, and Chilmad, 
trafficked with thee in splendid apparel, in mantles of blue and embroidered work, in chests of damask bound with cords and made of cedar, in thy market. 
The ships of Tarshish were the caravans for thy traffic; and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. 
Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas. 
Thy riches, and thy fairs, and thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the traders in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war within thee, and all thy multitude that is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. 
At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the pastures around thee shall shake. 
And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land, 
and shall cause their voice to be heard for thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast dust upon their heads, and roll themselves in ashes. 
And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth; and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing. 
And in their wailing they shall take up for thee a lamentation, and shall lament over thee, saying: “What city is like Tyre, like the Destroyed in the midst of the sea? 
When thy wares went forth from the seas, thou didst satisfy many nations; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the abundance of thy riches and thy merchandise. 
Now thou art broken by the seas in the depth of the waters, and thy merchandise and all thy multitude in the midst of thee are fallen. 
All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings shudder; they are troubled in their countenance. 
The merchants among the nations hiss at thee. Thou art a desolation, and shalt exist no more forever.”
