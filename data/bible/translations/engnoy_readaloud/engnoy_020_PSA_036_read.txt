Psalms.
Chapter 36.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.” To speak of the ungodliness of the wicked is in my heart. He hath no fear of God before his eyes. 
For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, Till his iniquity is found out and hated. 
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; He neglecteth to be wise and to do good. 
He deviseth mischief upon his bed; He persevereth in an evil way; He abhorreth not sin. 
Thy goodness, O LORD! reacheth to the heavens, And thy faithfulness to the clouds; 
Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; Thy judgments are a great deep; Thou, O LORD! preservest man and beast! 
How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! Yea, the sons of men seek refuge under the shadow of thy wings. 
They are satisfied with the abundance of thy house, And thou causest them to drink of the full stream of thy pleasures. 
For with thee is the fountain of life; Through thy light we see light. 
O continue thy loving-kindness to them that know thee, And thy favor to the upright in heart! 
Let not the foot of the proud come upon me, Nor the hand of the wicked remove me! 
Lo! already are the workers of iniquity fallen; They are cast down; they are unable to rise!
