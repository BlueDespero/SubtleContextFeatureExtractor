Proverbs.
Chapter 17.
Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of flesh-banquets with strife. 
A prudent servant shall rule over a son who causeth shame; Yea, with brothers he shall share the inheritance. 
The refining-pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But the LORD trieth hearts. 
An evil-doer listeneth to mischievous lips; And a liar giveth ear to a destructive tongue. 
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; He that is glad at calamities shall not go unpunished. 
Children's children are the crown of the aged, And their fathers the glory of sons. 
Excellent speech becometh not the base; How much less lying lips the noble! 
A gift is a precious stone in the eyes of him who taketh it; Whithersoever it turneth it hath success. 
He who covereth an offence seeketh love; But he who recurreth to a matter removeth a friend. 
A reproof will penetrate deeper into a wise man Than a hundred stripes into a fool. 
An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore shall a cruel messenger be sent against him. 
Let a man meet a bear robbed of her whelps, Rather than a fool in his folly. 
Whoso returneth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house. 
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water; Therefore leave off contention before it rolleth onward. 
He that justifieth the wicked, And he that condemneth the just, Both alike are an abomination to the LORD. 
Why should a price be in the hand of a fool To get wisdom, seeing he hath no sense? 
A friend loveth at all times; But in adversity he is born a brother. 
A man who lacketh understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 
He who loveth strife loveth transgression; He who raiseth high his gate seeketh ruin. 
He that is of a deceitful heart shall find no good; And he that turneth about with his tongue shall fall into mischief. 
Whoso begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; Yea, the father of the fool hath no joy. 
A merry heart doeth good to the body; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones. 
The wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of judgment. 
Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 
A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bore him. 
Moreover, to punish the righteous is not good, Nor to smite the noble for their equity. 
He that spareth his words is imbued with knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 
Even a fool, when he is silent, is accounted wise; He that shutteth his lips is a man of understanding.
