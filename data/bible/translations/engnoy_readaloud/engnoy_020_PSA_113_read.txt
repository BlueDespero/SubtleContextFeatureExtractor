Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Praise ye the LORD! Praise, O ye servants of the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD! 
Blessed be the name of the LORD From this time forth, even for ever! 
From the rising of the sun to its going down, May the LORD'S name be praised! 
The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens. 
Who is like the LORD, our God, That dwelleth on high, 
That looketh down low Upon the heavens and the earth? 
He raiseth the poor from the dust, And exalteth the needy from the dunghill, 
To set him among princes, Even among the princes of his people. 
He causeth the barren woman to dwell in a house, A joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD!
