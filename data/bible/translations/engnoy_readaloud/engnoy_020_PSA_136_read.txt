O give thanks to the LORD! for he is kind; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
O give thanks to the God of gods; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
O give thanks to the Lord of lords; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him that alone doeth great wonders; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him that made the heavens with wisdom; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him that spread out the earth upon the waters; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him that made the great lights; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
The sun to rule the day; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
The moon and stars to rule the night; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him that smote in Egypt their first-born; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And brought Israel from the midst of them; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
With a strong hand and an outstretched arm; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him who divided the Red sea into parts; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him who led his people through the wilderness; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
To him who smote great kings; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And slew mighty kings; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
Sihon, the king of the Amorites; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And Og, the king of Bashan; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And gave their land for an inheritance; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
For an inheritance to Israel his servant; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
Who remembered us in our low estate; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
And redeemed us from our enemies; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
Who giveth food unto all; For his goodness endureth for ever! 
O give thanks to the God of heaven; For his goodness endureth for ever!
