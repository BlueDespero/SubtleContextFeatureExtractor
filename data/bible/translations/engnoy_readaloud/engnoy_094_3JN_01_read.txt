THE THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN.
Chapter 1.
The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth. 
Beloved, in all things I pray that thou mayst prosper and be in health, as thy soul prospereth. 
For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bore witness to thy truth, as thou walkest in truth. 
I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children walk in the truth. 
Beloved, thou doest a faithful thing whatever thou doest to the brethren, and that to strangers, 
who bore witness of thy love before the church; whom if thou send forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, thou wilt do well. 
For in behalf of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the gentiles. 
We therefore ought to sustain such persons, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth. 
I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. 
Wherefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, he himself doth not receive the brethren, and those that would he forbiddeth, and casteth them out of the church. 
Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God; he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 
To Demetrius testimony hath been borne by all, and by the truth itself; yea, we also bear witness, and ye know that our witness is true. 
I had many things to write to thee, but I do not wish to write to thee with ink and pen; 
but I hope to see thee immediately, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
