Romans.
Chapter 14.
Him that is weak in his faith receive with kindness, and not to pass judgment on his thoughts. 
One man hath faith to eat every kind of food; another, who is weak, eateth herbs only. 
Let not him who eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him who eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him. 
Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? To his own lord he standeth or falleth; and he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand. 
One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike: let each one be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord; 
and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth thanks to God; and he that doth not eat, to the Lord he doth not eat, and giveth thanks to God. 
For none of us liveth to himself, and no one dieth to himself. 
For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Whether then we live or die, we are the Lord's. 
For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living. 
But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? And thou, too, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God. 
For it is written, “As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall give praise to God.” 
So then every one of us will give account of himself to God. 
Let us then no longer judge one another; but let this rather be your judgment, not to put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall, in a brother's way. 
I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him that accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 
For if on account of food thy brother is made to mourn, thou art no longer walking according to love. Do not with thy food destroy him for whom Christ died. 
Let not then the blessing which ye enjoy be evil spoken of. 
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit; 
for he who in this matter serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved by men. 
Let us then strive to promote peace, and the edification of each other. 
Do not for the sake of food undo the work of God. All things indeed are clean; but that which is pure is evil for that man who eateth so as to be an occasion of sin. 
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is put in danger of falling, or is made weak. 
Thou hast faith; have it to thyself before God. Happy is he who doth not condemn himself in that which he alloweth. 
But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he doeth it not from faith; but every thing which is not from faith is sin.
