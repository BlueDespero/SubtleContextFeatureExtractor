1 Corinthians.
Chapter 11.
Follow my example, as I do that of Christ. 
Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember me, and hold fast the instructions, as I delivered them to you. 
But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 
Every man that prayeth or prophesieth having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. 
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if her head were shaved. 
For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn; but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. 
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man; 
for the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man; 
and the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man. 
For this cause the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 
But neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. 
For as the woman is from the man, so also is the man by the woman; but all things from God. 
Judge in your own selves; is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered? 
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him, 
but that if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her? for her hair is given for a covering. 
But if any one seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God. 
But I give you this charge, not praising you, because ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. 
For in the first place, when ye come together in assembly of the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it; 
for there must be also parties among you, that they who are approved may also become manifest among you. 
When ye come together then in the same place, there is no eating of the Lord's supper. 
For, when ye eat, every one taketh before any distribution his own supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 
What! have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God, and shame those who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you. 
For I received of the Lord, what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took a loaf, 
and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you; this do in remembrance of me. 
In like manner also the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant, in my blood; this do, as oft as ye drink, in remembrance of me. 
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye show forth the Lord's death, till he come. 
So that whoever eateth the bread or drinketh the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty with respect to the body and the blood of the Lord. 
But let a man examine himself, and thus let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup; 
for he that eateth and drinketh eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, if he do not discern the body. 
For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and some are falling asleep. 
But if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged; 
but when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. 
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another. 
If any one hunger, let him eat at home; that ye may not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
