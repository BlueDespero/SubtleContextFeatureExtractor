Hosea.
Chapter 10.
Israel is a luxuriant vine, That bringeth forth fruit; But according to the abundance of his fruit hath he abounded in altars; According to the goodness of his land hath he made goodly images. 
Their heart is divided; now shall they suffer for it; He will break down their altars, And destroy their images. 
For soon shall they say, We have no king, Because we fear not Jehovah; What can a king do for us? 
They utter empty words, Swearing falsely, making covenants, And now judgment springeth up, as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
For the calf of Bethaven shall the inhabitants of Samaria be in fear; Yea, its people shall grieve for it, And its priests shall tremble for it, Because its glory has departed from it. 
It shall be carried to Assyria, As a present to the hostile king. Ephraim shall be covered with confusion, And Israel shall be ashamed of his doings, 
Samaria shall be brought to destruction; Her king shall be as a twig upon the waters. 
The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed; The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us! And to the hills, Fall on us! 
More than in the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel! There they stood; The battle in Gibeah against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them. 
Now will I chastise them according to my pleasure, And the nations shall be gathered together against them, When I shall bind them for their two iniquities. 
Ephraim is a trained heifer, that loveth to tread out the corn; But I will lay the yoke upon her fair neck; I will cause Ephraim to draw, Judah shall plough, Jacob shall harrow. 
Sow for yourselves to righteousness, and ye shall reap according to your piety; Break up your fallow ground; For it is a time to seek Jehovah, Till he come and rain righteousness upon you. 
Ye plough wickedness, ye shall reap injustice; Ye shall eat the fruit of falsehood. Because thou trustest in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men, 
There shall arise a tumult among thy people, And all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Betharbel in the day of battle, When the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. 
Such things shall Bethel bring upon you Because of your great wickedness. In the morning shall the king of Israel be destroyed.
