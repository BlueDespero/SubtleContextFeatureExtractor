Psalms.
Chapter 47.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of the sons of Korah.” O clap your hands, all ye nations! Shout unto God with the voice of triumph! 
For terrible is Jehovah, the Most High, The great king over all the earth. 
He hath subdued nations under us, And kingdoms under our feet; 
He hath chosen for us an inheritance, The glory of Jacob, whom he loved. Pause. 
God goeth up with a shout; Jehovah with the sound of the trumpet. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our king, sing praises! 
For God is king of all the earth; Sing to him hymns of praise! 
God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne. 
The princes of the nations gather themselves together To the people of the God of Abraham; For the mighty of the earth belong to God; He is supremely exalted.
