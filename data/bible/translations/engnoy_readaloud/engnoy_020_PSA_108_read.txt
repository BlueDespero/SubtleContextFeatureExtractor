Psalms.
Chapter 108.
“A psalm of David.” O God! my heart is strengthened! I will sing and give thanks. 
Awake, my soul! awake, my psaltery and harp! I will wake with the early dawn. 
I will praise thee, O LORD! among the nations; I will sing to thee among the peoples! 
For thy mercy reacheth to the heavens, And thy truth above the clouds. 
Exalt thyself, O God! above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth! 
That thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer me! 
God promiseth in his holiness; I will rejoice; I shall yet divide Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth; 
Gilead shall be mine, and mine Manasseh; Ephraim shall be my helmet, And Judah my sceptre. 
Moab shall be my washbowl; Upon Edom shall I cast my shoe; I shall triumph over Philistia. 
Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God! who didst forsake us, Who didst not go forth with our armies? 
Give us thine aid in our distress, For vain is the help of man! 
Through God we shall do valiantly; For he will tread down our enemies.
