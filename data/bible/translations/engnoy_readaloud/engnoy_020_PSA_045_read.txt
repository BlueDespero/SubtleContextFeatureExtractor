Psalms.
Chapter 45.
“For the leader of the music. To be accompanied with the Shoshannim. A song of loveliness by the sons of Korah.” My heart is overflowing with a good matter; I will address my work to the king: May my tongue be like the pen of a ready writer! 
Thou art the fairest of the sons of men; Grace is poured upon thy lips; For God hath blessed thee for ever! 
Gird thy sword to thy thigh, thou hero!-Thy glory and ornament! 
In thy glorious array ride forth victoriously, On account of truth and mildness and justice; And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things! 
Thine arrows are sharp; Nations shall fall before thee; They shall pierce the hearts of the king's enemies. 
Thy throne is God's for ever and ever; The sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of equity! 
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest iniquity; Therefore hath God, thy God, anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows! 
All thy garments are myrrh, aloes, and cassia; From ivory palaces stringed instruments delight thee. 
Daughters of kings are among thy chosen women; On the right hand stands the queen In gold of Ophir. 
Listen, O daughter! consider, and incline thine ear; Forget thy people and thy father's house! 
For the king is captivated with thy beauty; He is now thy lord; honor thou him! 
So shall the daughter of Tyre seek thy favor with gifts, The rich among the people. 
All glorious is the king's daughter in her apartment; Her robe is embroidered with gold. 
In variegated garments shall she be led to the king; The virgin companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. 
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; They shall enter the king's palace. 
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes through all the land. 
I will make thy name memorable throughout all generations; So shall the nations praise thee for ever and ever!
