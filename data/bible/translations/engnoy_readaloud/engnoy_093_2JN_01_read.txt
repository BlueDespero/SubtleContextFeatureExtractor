THE SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN.
Chapter 1.
The elder to the elect Cyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all that know the truth,— 
for the sake of the truth which abideth in us, and will be with us for ever. 
Grace, mercy, peace shall be with you from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
I rejoiced greatly, that I found some of thy children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. 
And now I beseech thee, Cyria, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it. 
For many deceivers went out into the world, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ coming in the flesh; this is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which ye wrought, but receive a full reward. 
Whoever goeth beyond, and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the teaching, he hath both the Son and the Father. 
If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into your house, and do not bid him good speed. 
For he that biddeth him good speed taketh part in his evil deeds. 
Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be full. 
The children of thy elect sister salute thee.
