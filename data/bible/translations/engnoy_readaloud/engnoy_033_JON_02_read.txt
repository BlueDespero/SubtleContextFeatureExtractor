Jonah.
Chapter 2.
Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah from the belly of the fish, 
and said:— I cried by reason of my distress to Jehovah, And he heard me: Out of the depth of the under-world I cried, And thou didst hear my voice. 
Thou didst cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea, And the flood compassed me about; All thy billows and thy waves passed over me. 
And I said, “I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again to thy holy temple!” 
The waters compassed me about, even to the life, The deep enclosed me round about; Sea-weeds were bound around my head; 
I sank down to the foundations of the mountains; The bars of the earth were about me forever; Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah, my God! 
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah, And my prayer came to thee, To thy holy temple. 
They that honor lying vanities forsake their mercy; 
But I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed; Salvation is from Jehovah. 
And Jehovah commanded the fish, and it cast out Jonah upon the dry land.
