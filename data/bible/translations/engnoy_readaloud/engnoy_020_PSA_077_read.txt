Psalms.
Chapter 77.
“For the leader of the music of the Jeduthunites. A psalm of Asaph.” I call upon God; I cry aloud for help; I call upon God, that he would hear me! 
In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; In the night is my hand stretched forth continually; My soul refuseth to be comforted. 
I remember God, and am disquieted; I think of him, and my spirit is overwhelmed. 
Thou keepest mine eyelids from closing; I am distressed, so that I cannot speak! 
I think of the days of old,—The years of ancient times. 
I call to remembrance my songs in the night; I meditate in my heart, And my spirit inquireth: 
Will the Lord be angry for ever? Will he be favorable no more? 
Is his mercy utterly withdrawn for ever? Doth his promise fail from generation to generation? 
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his compassion? 
Then I say, “This is mine affliction, A change in the right hand of the Most High.” 
I remember the deeds of Jehovah; I think of thy wonders of old. 
I meditate on all thy works, And talk of thy doings. 
Thy ways, O God! are holy! Who so great a god as our God? 
Thou art a God who doest wonders; Thou hast manifested thy power among the nations. 
With thy strong arm thou didst redeem thy people,—The sons of Jacob and Joseph. 
The waters saw thee, O God! The waters saw thee, and feared, And the deep trembled. 
The clouds poured out water, The skies sent forth thunder, And thine arrows flew. 
Thy thunder roared in the whirlwind; Thy lightning illumined the world; The earth trembled and shook. 
Thy way was through the sea, And thy path through great waters; And thy footsteps could not be found. 
Thou didst lead thy people like a flock, By the hands of Moses and Aaron.
