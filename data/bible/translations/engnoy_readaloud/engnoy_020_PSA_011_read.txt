Psalms.
Chapter 11.
“For the leader of the music. A psalm of David.” In the LORD do I put my trust. Why say ye to me, “Flee, like a bird, to your mountain? 
For, lo! the wicked bend their bow; They make ready their arrows on the string, To shoot in secret at the upright in heart. 
If the pillars be broken down, What can the righteous do?” 
The LORD is in his holy palace; The LORD'S throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids prove the children of men. 
The LORD trieth the righteous; But the wicked, and the lover of violence, his soul hateth. 
Upon the wicked he will rain lightning; Fire and brimstone and a burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. 
For the LORD is righteous; he loveth righteousness; The upright shall see his face.
