Proverbs.
Chapter 12.
He who loveth correction loveth knowledge; But he who hateth rebuke remaineth stupid. 
The good man obtaineth favor from the LORD; But the man of wicked devices he condemneth. 
A man shall not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous shall not be moved. 
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; But she who causeth shame is as rottenness in his bones. 
The purposes of the righteous are just; The designs of the wicked are deceitful. 
The words of the wicked lie in wait for men's blood; But the mouth of the upright delivereth them. 
The wicked are overthrown, and are no more; But the house of the righteous shall stand. 
A man will be commended according to his wisdom; But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. 
Better is he that demeaneth himself, and hath a servant, Than he that exalteth himself, and hath no bread. 
The righteous man careth for the life of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. 
He who tilleth his own land shall be satisfied with bread; But he who followeth worthless persons is void of understanding. 
The wicked man longeth after the prey of evil-doers; But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. 
In the transgression of the lips is a dangerous snare; But the righteous man shall escape from trouble. 
By the fruit of a man's mouth he shall be filled with good, And the recompense of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. 
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes; But he that hearkeneth to counsel is wise. 
A fool's wrath is instantly known; But he that hideth insult is wise. 
He that speaketh truth testifieth what is right; But a false witness, deceit. 
There is who babbleth like the piercing of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health. 
The lip of truth shall be established for ever; But the tongue of falsehood, but for a moment. 
Deceit is in the heart of those who contrive evil; But to the counsellors of peace shall be joy. 
No evil shall happen to the righteous; But the wicked shall be filled with calamity. 
False lips are the abomination of the LORD; But they who deal truly are his delight. 
A prudent man concealeth his knowledge; Bur the heart of fools proclaimeth their foolishness. 
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; But the slothful shall be under tribute. 
Anxiety in the heart of a man boweth it down; But a kind word maketh it glad. 
The righteous showeth the way to his neighbor; But the way of the wicked leadeth them astray. 
The slothful man shall not roast his game; But a precious treasure to any man is he that is diligent. 
In the path of righteousness is life, And in her pathway there is no death.
