Psalms.
Chapter 100.
“A psalm of praise.” Raise a voice of joy unto the LORD, all ye lands! 
Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before his presence with rejoicing! 
Know ye that Jehovah is God! It is he that made us, and we are his, His people, and the flock of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And his courts with praise; Be thankful to him, and bless his name! 
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; And his truth endureth to all generations.
