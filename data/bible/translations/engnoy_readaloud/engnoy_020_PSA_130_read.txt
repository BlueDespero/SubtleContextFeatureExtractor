Psalms.
Chapter 130.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up.” Out of the depths do I cry to thee, O LORD! 
O Lord! listen to my voice, Let thine ears be attentive to my supplication! 
If thou, LORD, shouldst treasure up transgressions, Lord, who could stand? 
But with thee is forgiveness, That thou mayst be feared. 
I trust in the LORD; my soul doth trust, And in his promise do I confide. 
My soul waiteth for the LORD More than they who watch for the morning; Yea, more than they who watch for the morning! 
O Israel! trust in the LORD! For with the LORD is mercy, And with him is plenteous redemption. 
He will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
