Daniel.
Chapter 10.
In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, was a revelation made to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar; and the revelation is true, and relateth to long warfare. And he gave heed to the revelation, and had understanding of the vision. 
In those days, I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. 
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, till three whole weeks were ended. 
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river Hiddekel, 
I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man, clothed in linen garments, and his loins girded with gold of Uphaz. 
His body was like chrysolite, and his face had the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like the appearance of polished brass, and the sound of his words was as the shout of a multitude. 
And I Daniel alone saw the vision and the men who were with me saw not the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. 
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision; and there remained no strength in me, and my color was changed upon me into a deadly paleness, and I retained no strength. 
And I heard the sound of his words; and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell senseless upon my face, and my face toward the ground. 
And behold, a hand touched me, and lifted me upon my knees and the palms of my hands. 
And he said to me, Daniel, much-beloved man, give heed to the words which I speak to thee, and stand upright! for to thee am I now sent. And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling. 
Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel! for from the first day that thou didst set thy mind to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come on account of thy words. 
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood up against me one and twenty days; but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left there victorious with the kings of Persia. 
Now I am come to teach thee what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision yet relates to distant days. 
And when he had spoken these words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. 
And behold, one having the appearance of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spake, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my pain came upon me, and I have no strength left. 
And how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? And now there remaineth no strength in me, neither is breath left in me. 
Then one having the appearance of a man again touched me and strengthened me, 
and said, Fear not, much-beloved man! peace be to thee! be strong, yea, be strong! And while he was speaking with me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. 
Then he said, Knowest thou wherefore I have come to thee? And now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia, and I will go forth, and behold, the prince of Greece will come. 
But I will show thee what is written in the book of truth. No one putteth forth his strength with me against them but Michael, your prince.
