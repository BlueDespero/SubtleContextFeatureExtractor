1 Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. 
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. 
Love suffereth long, is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not herself, is not puffed up, 
doth not behave herself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, maketh no account of an injury, 
rejoiceth not at iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, 
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. 
Love never faileth; but whether there are prophesyings, they will come to an end; whether tongues, they will cease; whether knowledge, it will be done away. 
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; 
but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part will be done away. 
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I had the feelings of a child, I thought as a child; since I have become a man, I have put away the things of the child. 
For now we see in a mirror, obscurely; but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully known. 
And now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
