Acts.
Chapter 6.
But in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It doth not seem to us proper, that we should leave the word of God, and provide for tables. 
Therefore, brethren, look out among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this business; 
but we will give ourselves closely to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
And what was said pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch, 
whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly enlarged; and a great multitude of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people. 
But some of those who belonged to the so-called synagogue of the Freedmen, and of the Cyrenaeans and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen; 
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. 
Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and God. 
And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him to the council, 
and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place, and the Law. 
For we have heard him say, This Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses delivered to us. 
And all that sat in the council, looking steadily upon him, saw his face like the face of an angel.
