THE EPISTLE OF PAUL THE APOSTLE TO THE EPHESIANS.
Chapter 1.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and believers in Christ Jesus: 
Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly regions in Christ; 
according as he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him; 
having in love predestinated us for himself to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved; 
in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 
which he made to abound toward us, in all wisdom and understanding; 
having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself 
in reference to the dispensation of the fullness of the times, to gather for himself into one all things in Christ, the things which are in the heavens, and the things on the earth; even in him, 
in whom we also obtained the inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, 
that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who have before placed our hope in the Messiah; 
in whom ye also, after having heard the word of truth, the glad tidings of your salvation, in whom, I say, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit that was promised, 
which is a pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory. 
For this cause I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and of your love to all the saints, 
do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him; 
the eyes of your mind being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope belonging to his call of you, and what the riches of the glory of the inheritance which he hath given among the saints, 
and what the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, 
which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead; and seated him at his own right hand in the heavenly regions, 
far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; 
and put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, 
which is his body, the fullness of him who filleth all with all;
