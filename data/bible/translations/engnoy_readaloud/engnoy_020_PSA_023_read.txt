Psalms.
Chapter 23.
“A psalm of David.” The LORD is my shepherd: I shall not want. 
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters. 
He reviveth my soul; He leadeth me in paths of safety, For his name's sake. 
When I walk through a valley of deathlike shade, I fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy crook and thy staff, they comfort me. 
Thou preparest a table before me In the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil; My cup runneth over. 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
