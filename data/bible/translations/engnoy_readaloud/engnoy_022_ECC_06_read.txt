Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 6.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it lieth heavy upon men; 
a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor, and nothing is wanting to him of all which he desireth, yet God giveth him not to taste thereof; but a stranger enjoyeth it. This is vanity, yea, a grievous evil. 
Though a man have a hundred children, and live many years, and though the days of his years be many, if his soul be not satisfied with good, and he have no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better than he. 
This, indeed, cometh in nothingness, and goeth down into darkness, and its name is covered with darkness; 
it hath not seen the sun, nor known it; yet hath it rest rather than the other. 
Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and see no good, — do not all go to one place? 
All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet his desires are not satisfied. 
For what advantage hath the wise man over the fool? What advantage hath the poor, who knoweth how to walk before the living? 
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity, and striving after wind. 
That which is was long ago called by name; and it was known that he is a man, and that he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he. 
Seeing there are many things which increase vanity, what advantage hath man from them? 
For who knoweth what is good for man in life, in all the days of his vain life, which he spendeth as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
