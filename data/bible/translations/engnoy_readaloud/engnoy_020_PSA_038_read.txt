Psalms.
Chapter 38.
“A psalm of David. To bring to remembrance.” O LORD! rebuke me not in thy wrath, Nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure! 
For thine arrows have deeply pierced me, And thy hand hath been heavy upon me. 
There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger; Nor rest in my bones, because of my sin. 
For my iniquities have gone over my head; Like a heavy burden, they are more than I can bear. 
My wounds putrefy and are loathsome on account of my folly. 
I am bent; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 
For my loins are full of burning heat, And there is no soundness in my flesh. 
I am weakened and bruised exceedingly; I roar by reason of the disquietude of my heart. 
O Lord! thou knowest all my desire, And my groaning is not hidden from thee! 
My heart panteth; my strength faileth me; The very light of my eyes is gone from me. 
My friends and acquaintance keep aloof from my woe, And my kinsmen stand afar off: 
While they who seek my life lay snares for me; They who seek my hurt threaten destruction, And meditate deceit all the day long. 
But I, like a deaf man, hear not; And, like a dumb man, open not my mouth. 
I am like one who heareth nothing, And in whose mouth is no reply. 
For in thee, O LORD! do I put my trust; Thou wilt hear, O Lord, my God! 
For I have prayed, “Let them not rejoice over me; Let them not exult at the slipping of my feet!” 
For I am ready to fall, And my pain doth never leave me; 
For I confess my iniquity, And am troubled on account of my sin. 
But my enemies flourish and are strong; They who hate me without cause are multiplied. 
They who repay good with evil are my enemies, Because I follow that which is good. 
Forsake me not, O LORD! O my God! be not far from me! 
Make hast to mine aid, O Lord, my salvation!
