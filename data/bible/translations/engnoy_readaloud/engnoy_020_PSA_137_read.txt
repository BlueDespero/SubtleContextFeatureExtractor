Psalms.
Chapter 137.
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion. 
We hung our harps on the willows in the midst thereof. 
For there they who carried us away captive required of us a song; They who wasted us required of us mirth: “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!” 
How shall we sing the LORD'S song In a strange land? 
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her cunning! 
If I do not remember thee, Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy! 
Remember, O LORD! against the children of Edom The day of the calamity of Jerusalem! Who said, “Raze it, Raze it to its foundations!” 
O daughter of Babylon, thou destroyer! Happy be he who requiteth thee As thou hast dealt with us! 
Happy be he who seizeth thy little ones And dasheth them against the stones!
