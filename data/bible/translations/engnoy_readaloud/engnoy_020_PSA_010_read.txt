Psalms.
Chapter 10.
Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 
Through the haughtiness of the wicked the poor are in distress; They are caught in the wiles which are contrived for them. 
The wicked boasteth of his heart's desire; The rapacious renounceth and contemneth Jehovah. 
The wicked saith in his haughtiness, “He careth not!” All his thoughts are, “There is no God.” 
His course is always prosperous; Far in the heights are thy judgments from him; As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 
He saith in his heart, “I shall never fall; I shall never be in adversity.” 
His mouth is full of perjury, deceit, and oppression; Mischief and injustice are upon his tongue. 
He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are secretly fixed upon the poor. 
He secretly lieth in wait, like a lion in a thicket; He lieth in wait to seize upon the helpless; He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net. 
He croucheth, and lowereth himself, And the wretched fall into his paws. 
He saith in his heart, “God doth forget; He hideth his face; he doth never see it.” 
Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up thine hand: Forget not the distressed! 
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, “He careth not for it”? 
Thou dost see it; yea, thou beholdest malice and oppression, And markest it upon thy hand! The poor committeth himself to thee; Thou art the helper of the fatherless. 
Break thou the arm of the unjust and wicked man; Seek out his wickedness, till thou canst find none! 
Jehovah is king for ever and ever; The gentiles shall perish out of his land. 
Thou, O LORD! wilt hear the desires of the distressed; Thou wilt strengthen their hearts; Thou wilt lend a listening ear! 
Thou wilt maintain the cause of the fatherless and the oppressed, That henceforth none may be driven from the land.
