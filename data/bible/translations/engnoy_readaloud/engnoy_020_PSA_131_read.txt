Psalms.
Chapter 131.
“A psalm of the steps, or the goings up. Of David.” O LORD! my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; I employ not myself on great things, or things too wonderful for me! 
Yea, I have stilled and quieted my soul As a weaned child upon his mother; My soul within me is like a weaned child. 
O Israel! trust in the LORD, Henceforth even for ever!
