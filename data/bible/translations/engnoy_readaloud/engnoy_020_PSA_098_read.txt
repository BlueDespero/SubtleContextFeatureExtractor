Psalms.
Chapter 98.
“A psalm.” Sing to the LORD a new song; For he hath done marvellous things; His own right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the victory! 
The LORD hath made known his salvation; His righteousness hath he manifested in the sight of the nations. 
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel, And all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
Shout unto the LORD, all the earth! Break forth into joy, and exult, and sing! 
Sing to the LORD with the harp, With the harp, and the voice of song! 
With clarions, and the sound of trumpets, Make a joyful noise before the LORD the King! 
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein; 
Let the rivers clap their hands, And the mountains rejoice together 
Before the LORD! for he cometh to judge the earth! With righteousness will he judge the world, And the nations with equity.
