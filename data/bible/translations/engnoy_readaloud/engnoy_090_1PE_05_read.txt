1 Peter.
Chapter 5.
The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a sharer in the glory that is to be revealed; 
tend the flock of God which is among you, overseeing it, not by constraint, but willingly; not for base gain, but with ready mind; 
not as lording it over your allotted charge, but being examples to the flock; 
and when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye will receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. 
In like manner, ye younger men, submit yourselves to the elder; and all of you be clothed with humility toward each other; for “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.” 
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; 
casting all your care upon him, because he careth for you. 
Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; 
whom resist, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished in your brethren in the world. 
But the God of all grace, who called you to his everlasting glory in Christ Jesus, will, after ye have suffered a while, himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you. 
To him be the dominion for ever. Amen. 
By Silvanus, the faithful brother as I think, I have written to you in few words, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 
The church in Babylon, chosen with you, saluteth you; and Mark, my son. 
Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all that are in Christ.
