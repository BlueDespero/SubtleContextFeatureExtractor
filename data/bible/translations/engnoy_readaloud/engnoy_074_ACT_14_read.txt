Acts.
Chapter 14.
And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks believed. 
But the Jews that disbelieved stirred up and embittered the minds of the gentiles against the brethren. 
They abode therefore a long time there, speaking boldly in reliance on the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be wrought by their a hands. 
But the multitude of the city was divided; and some held with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 
And when a movement was made both of the gentiles, and the Jews with their rulers, to abuse and stone them, 
they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the neighboring country; 
and they were publishing the glad tidings there. 
And at Lystra there sat a certain man who had not the use of his feet, a cripple from his birth, who never had walked. 
This man heard Paul speaking; who looking steadily at him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked. 
And the multitudes, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, saying, in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men. 
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker. 
Then the priest of Jupiter, that was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have offered sacrifice with the multitudes. 
But the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, when they heard of it, rent their garments, and rushed forth to the multitude, crying out 
and saying, Men, why do ye these things? We also are men of like nature with you, bringing to you glad tidings, that ye may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea, and all things that are therein; 
who in the ages past suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways; 
although he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness. 
And with these words, they hardly restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them. 
But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium; who, having persuaded the multitudes, and stoned Paul, dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. 
But the disciples having gathered around him, he rose up, and came into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 
And when they had published the glad tidings to that city, and had made many disciples, they went back to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch; 
confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that it is through many afflictions that we mast enter into the kingdom of God. 
And having appointed for them elders in every church, they prayed with fasting, and commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed. 
And having gone through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia; 
and when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, 
and thence set sail for Antioch, whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had accomplished. 
And when they had arrived and had gathered the church together, they related what great things God had wrought with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the gentiles. 
And they abode no little time with the disciples.
