Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass or a clashing cymbal. 
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
And though I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and though I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing. 
Love is patient, love is kind; love does not envy; love does not boast, is not arrogant; 
does not behave disgracefully, does not seek its own, is not provoked to anger, thinks no evil; 
does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; 
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 
Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they shall pass away; whether there are tongues, they shall cease; whether there is knowledge, it shall pass away. 
Now we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is partial shall pass away. 
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I put away the things of the child. 
For now we see through a mirror by reflection, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. 
And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
