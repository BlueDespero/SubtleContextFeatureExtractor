The Epistle To The Hebrews.
Chapter 1.
God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 
has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; 
who being the radiance of His glory and the exact expression of His substance, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 
having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they. 
For to which of the angels did He ever say: “You are My Son, today I have begotten You”? And again: “I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be a Son to Me”? 
But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: “Let all the angels of God worship Him.” 
And of the angels He says, “He who makes His angels spirits and His ministers flames of fire.” 
But of the Son He says: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom. 
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions.” 
And: “You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. 
They shall perish, but You continue; and they all shall grow old like a garment; 
and like a cloak You will roll them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.” 
But to which of the angels has He ever said: “Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”? 
Are they not all ministering spirits being sent out to minister for the sake of those who shall be heirs of salvation?
