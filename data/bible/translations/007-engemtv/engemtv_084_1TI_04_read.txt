1 Timothy.
Chapter 4.
But the Spirit explicitly says, that in latter times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 
speaking lies in hypocrisy, having been seared with a hot iron as to their own conscience, 
forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who are believers and have come to know the truth. 
Because every creature of God is good, and not one is to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving, 
for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. 
Instructing the brothers in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed. 
But reject profane and old wives' tales, and exercise yourself unto godliness. 
For bodily exercise is profitable a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of the coming life. 
Trustworthy is this word and worthy of all acceptance. 
For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers. 
These things command and teach. 
Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather become a pattern for the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
Until I come, give attention to public reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. 
Meditate on these things; be in these things, so that your progress may be evident to all. 
Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
