Ephesians.
Chapter 3.
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 
if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you, 
how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery, just as I wrote before briefly, 
with reference to which, when you read, you can understand my insight in the mystery of Christ, 
which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: 
that the Gentiles should be joint heirs, and of the same body, and joint partakers in His promise in Christ through the gospel, 
of which I became a minister according to the free gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the working of His power. 
To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 
and to enlighten all as to what is the administration of the mystery, which had been hidden from the ages in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ; 
that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, 
according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him. 
Therefore I beseech you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, which is your glory. 
For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
from whom every family in heaven and earth takes its name, 
that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power by His Spirit in the inner man, 
that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; being rooted and founded in love, 
that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height— 
and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 
Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 
to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
