2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, just as it is with you, 
and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked men; for not all have faith. 
But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and will guard you from the evil one. 
And we trust in the Lord concerning you, that the things which we command to you, you are both doing, and will do them. 
Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ. 
But we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother living in idleness, and not according to the tradition which they received from us. 
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you; 
nor did we eat bread from anyone without paying, but in labor and hardship, working night and day, so as not to be a burden to any of you, 
not because we do not have authority, but in order that we may give ourselves as a pattern to you, so that you might follow us. 
For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone is not willing to work, neither let him eat! 
For we hear that some are walking among you in a disorderly way, not working at all, but being busybodies. 
And to such people we command and urge by our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread. 
But as for you, brothers, do not lose heart in doing good. 
Now if anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him, and do not associate with him, that he may be ashamed. 
Yet do not consider him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all. 
The greeting of Paul by my own hand, which is a sign in every letter; so I write. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
