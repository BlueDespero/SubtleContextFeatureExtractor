Galatians.
Chapter 6.
Brothers, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness, looking out for yourself lest you also be tempted. 
Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ. 
For if anyone thinks that he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
But let each person examine his own work, and then he will have boasting in himself alone, and not in another. 
For each one shall bear his own load. 
Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. 
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man sows, this also will he reap. 
For he who sows to his flesh, from his own flesh will reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap everlasting life. 
And while we do good, let us not lose heart, for in due season we shall reap if we do not become weary. 
So then, as we have opportunity, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those who are of the household of faith. 
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! 
As many as wish to make a good showing in the flesh, these compel you to get circumcised, only so that they should not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
For not even those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, but they wish you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 
But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation. 
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. 
Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 
Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
