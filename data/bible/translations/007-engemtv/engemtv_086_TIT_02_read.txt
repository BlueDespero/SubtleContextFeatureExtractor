Titus.
Chapter 2.
But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. 
Older men are to be sober, serious, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, in endurance. 
Older women likewise are to be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teaching what is good, 
so that they may urge the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, 
temperate, pure, homemakers, good, submitting to their own husbands, lest the word of God be blasphemed. 
Likewise exhort the young men to be sensible, 
in all respects showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, dignity, incorruptibility, 
sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. 
Exhort bondservants to be subject to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not talking back, 
not embezzling, but showing good faith, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. 
For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men, 
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, 
looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 
who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people as His own possession, zealous for good works. 
Speak these things, exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
