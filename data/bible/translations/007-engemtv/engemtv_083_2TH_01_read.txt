The Second Epistle Of Paul To The Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We are obligated to give thanks to God always for you, brothers, and rightfully so, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all increases towards one another, 
so that we ourselves are boasting in you among the churches of God about your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure, 
which is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, on behalf of which you also suffer. 
Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, 
and to give you who are being afflicted rest along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with His mighty angels, 
in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
These shall pay a penalty—eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His might, 
whenever He comes, in that Day, to be glorified among His saints and to be marveled among all those who have believed, because our testimony among you was believed. 
Therefore we also pray always concerning you that our God may count you worthy of this calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power, 
in order that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
