2 Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
This will be the third time I am coming to you. “By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.” 
I have previously said, and I say beforehand, as being present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare you, 
since you are seeking proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but strong in you. 
For although He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we are weak in Him, yet we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you. 
Scrutinize yourselves as to whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you are reprobates? 
But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates. 
Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is honorable, though we may be as reprobates. 
For we can do nothing against the truth, but on behalf of the truth. 
For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete. 
Because of this I write these things being absent, in order that when I am present I may not deal sharply with you, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for edification and not for destruction. 
Finally brothers, farewell. Restore yourselves, comfort yourselves, be in agreement, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
All the saints greet you. 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
