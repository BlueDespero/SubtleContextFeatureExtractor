The First Epistle Of John.
Chapter 1.
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have gazed upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life— 
and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us— 
that which we have seen and heard we proclaim to you, in order that you also may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. 
And these things we write to you that our joy may be complete. 
And this is the message which we have heard from Him and we announce to you, that God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
If we claim to have fellowship with Him, and we are walking in darkness, we are lying, and are not practicing the truth. 
But if we are walking in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. 
If we claim that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
If we claim that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
