Chapter 24.
But in o dai of the woke ful eerli thei camen to the graue, and brouyten swete smellynge spices, that thei hadden arayed. 
And thei founden the stoon turned awei fro the graue. 
And thei yeden in, and founden not the bodi of the Lord Jhesu. 
And it was don, the while thei weren astonyed in thouyt of this thing, lo! twei men stoden bisidis hem in schynynge cloth. 
And whanne thei dredden, and boweden her semblaunt in to the erthe, thei seiden to hem, What seken ye hym that lyueth with deed men? 
He is not here, but is risun. Haue ye mynde, hou he spak to you, whanne he was yit in Galile, 
and seide, For it bihoueth mannys sone to be bitakun in to the hondis of synful men, and to be crucified, and the thridde dai to rise ayen. 
And thei bithouyten on hise wordis. 
And thei yeden ayen fro the graue, and telden alle these thingis to the enleuene, and to alle othir. 
And ther was Marie Mawdeleyn, and Joone, and Marie of James, and other wymmen that weren with hem, that seiden to apostlis these thingis. 
And these wordis weren seyn bifor hem as madnesse, and thei bileueden not to hem. 
But Petir roos vp, and ran to the graue; and he bowide doun, and say the lynen clothis liynge aloone. And he wente bi him silf, wondrynge on that that was don. 
And lo! tweyne of hem wenten in that dai in to a castel, that was fro Jerusalem the space of sixti furlongis, bi name Emaws. 
And thei spaken togidir of alle these thingis that haddun bifallun. 
And it was don, the while thei talkiden, and souyten bi hem silf, Jhesus hym silf neiyede, and wente with hem. 
But her iyen weren holdun, that thei knewen him not. 
And he seide to hem, What ben these wordis, that ye speken togidir wandrynge, and ye ben sorewful? 
And oon, whos name was Cleofas, answerde, and seide, Thou thi silf art a pilgrym in Jerusalem, and hast thou not knowun, what thingis ben don in it in these daies? 
To whom he seide, What thingis? And thei seiden to hym, Of Jhesu of Nazareth, that was a man prophete, myyti in werk and word bifor God and al the puple; 
and hou the heiyest preestis of oure princis bitoken hym in to dampnacioun of deeth, and crucifieden hym. 
But we hopiden, that he schulde haue ayenbouyt Israel. And now on alle these thingis the thridde dai is to dai, that these thingis weren don. 
But also summe wymmen of ouris maden vs afered, whiche bifor dai weren at the graue; and whanne his bodi was not foundun, 
thei camen, and seiden, that thei syen also a siyt of aungels, whiche seien, that he lyueth. 
And summe of oure wenten to the graue, and thei founden so as the wymmen seiden, but thei founden not hym. 
And he seide to hem, A! foolis, and slowe of herte to bileue in alle thingis that the prophetis han spokun. 
Whethir it bihofte not Crist to suffre these thingis, and so to entre in to his glorie? 
And he bigan at Moises and at alle the prophetis, and declaride to hem in alle scripturis, that weren of hym. 
And thei camen nyy the castel, whidur thei wenten. And he made countenaunce that he wolde go ferthere. 
And thei constreyneden hym, and seiden, Dwelle with vs, for it drawith to nyyt, and the dai is now bowid doun. 
And he entride with hem. And it was don, while he sat at the mete with hem, he took breed, and blesside, and brak, and took to hem. 
And the iyen of hem weren openyd, and thei knewen hym; and he vanyschide fro her iyen. 
And thei seiden togidir, Whether oure herte was not brennynge in vs, while he spak in the weie, and openyde to vs scripturis? 
And thei risen vp in the same our, and wenten ayen in to Jerusalem, and founden the enleuene gaderid togidir, and hem that weren with hem, 
seiynge, That the Lord is risun verrili, and apperide to Symount. 
And thei tolden what thingis weren don in the weie, and hou thei knewen hym in brekyng of breed. 
And the while thei spaken these thingis, Jhesus stood in the myddil of hem, and seide to hem, Pees to you; Y am, nyle ye drede. 
But thei weren affraied and agast, and gessiden hem to se a spirit. 
And he seide to hem, What ben ye troblid, and thouytis comen vp in to youre hertis? 
Se ye my hoondis and my feet, for Y my silf am. Fele ye, and se ye; for a spirit hath not fleisch and boonys, as ye seen that Y haue. 
And whanne he hadde seid this thing, he schewide hoondis and feet to hem. 
And yit while thei bileueden not, and wondriden for ioye, he seide, Han ye here ony thing that schal be etun? 
And thei proferden hym a part of a fisch rostid, and an hony combe. 
And whanne he hadde etun bifore hem, he took that that lefte, and yaf to hem; 
and seide `to hem, These ben the wordis that Y spak to you, whanne Y was yit with you; for it is nede that alle thingis ben fulfillid, that ben writun in the lawe of Moises, and in prophetis, and in salmes, of me. 
Thanne he openyde to hem wit, that thei schulden vnderstonde scripturis. 
And he seide to hem, For thus it is writun, and thus it bihofte Crist to suffre, and ryse ayen fro deeth in the thridde dai; 
and penaunce and remyssioun of synnes to be prechid in his name `in to alle folkis, bigynnynge at Jerusalem. 
And ye ben witnessis of these thingis. 
And Y schal sende the biheest of my fadir in to you; but sitte ye in the citee, til that ye be clothid with vertu from an hiy. 
And he ledde hem forth in to Betanye, and whanne his hondis weren lift vp, he blesside hem. 
And it was don, the while he blesside hem, he departide fro hem, and was borun in to heuene. 
And thei worschipiden, and wenten ayen in to Jerusalem with greet ioye, 
and weren euermore in the temple, heriynge and blessynge God.
