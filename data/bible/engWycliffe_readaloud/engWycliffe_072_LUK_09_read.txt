Luke.
Chapter 9.
And whanne the twelue apostlis weren clepid togidir, Jhesus yaf to hem vertu and power on alle deuelis, and that thei schulden heele sijknessis. 
And he sente hem for to preche the kyngdom of God, and to heele sijk men. 
And he seide to hem, No thing take ye in the weie, nether yerde, ne scrippe, nether breed, ne money, and nether haue ye two cootis. 
And in to what hous that ye entren, dwelle ye there, and go ye not out fro thennus. 
And who euer resseyuen not you, go ye out of that citee, and schake ye of the poudir of youre feet in to witnessyng on hem. 
And thei yeden forth, and wenten aboute bi castels, prechynge and helynge euery where. 
And Eroude tetrak herde alle thingis that weren don of hym, and he doutide, 
for that it was seide of sum men, that Joon was risen fro deth; and of summen, that Elie hadde apperid; but of othere, that oon of the elde prophetis was risun. 
And Eroude seide, Y haue biheedid Joon; and who is this, of whom Y here siche thingis? And he souyte to se hym. 
And the apostlis turneden ayen, and tolden to hym alle thingis that thei hadden don. And he took hem, and wente bisidis in to a desert place, that is Bethsada. 
And whanne the puple knewen this, thei folewiden hym. And he resseyuede hem, and spak to hem of the kyngdom of God; and he heelide hem that hadden neede of cure. 
And the dai bigan to bowe doun, and the twelue camen, and seiden to hym, Leeue the puple, that thei go, and turne in to castels and townes, that ben aboute, that thei fynde mete, for we ben here in a desert place. 
And he seide to hem, Yue ye to hem to ete. And thei seiden, Ther ben not to vs mo than fyue looues and twei fischis, but perauenture that we go, and bie meetis to al this puple. 
And the men weren almost fyue thousynde. And he seide to hise disciplis, Make ye hem sitte to mete bi cumpanyes, a fifti to gidir. 
And thei diden so, and thei maden alle men sitte to mete. 
And whanne he hadde take the fyue looues and twei fischis, he biheeld in to heuene, and blesside hem, and brak, and delide to hise disciplis, that thei schulden sette forth bifor the cumpanyes. 
And alle men eeten, and weren fulfillid; and that that lefte to hem of brokun metis was takun vp, twelue cofyns. 
And it was don, whanne he was aloone preiynge, hise disciplis weren with hym, and he axide hem, and seide, Whom seien the puple that Y am? 
And thei answeriden, and seiden, Joon Baptist, othir seien Elie, and othir seien, o profete of the formere is risun. 
And he seide to hem, But who seien ye that Y am? Symount Petir answeride, and seide, The Crist of God. 
And he blamynge hem comaundide that thei schulden seie to no man, 
and seide these thingis, For it bihoueth mannus sone to suffre many thingis, and to be repreued of the elder men, and of the princis of prestis, and of scribis, and to be slayn, and the thridde dai to rise ayen. 
And he seide to alle, If ony wole come aftir me, denye he hym silf, and take he his cross euery dai, and sue he me. 
For he that wole make his lijf saaf schal leese it; and he that leesith his lijf for me, schal make it saaf. 
And what profitith it to a man, if he wynne al the world, and leese hymsilf, and do peiryng of him silf. 
For who so schameth me and my wordis, mannus sone schal schame hym, whanne he cometh in his maieste, and of the fadris, and of the hooli aungels. 
And Y seie to you, verily ther ben summe stondynge here, whiche schulen not taste deeth, til thei seen the rewme of God. 
And it was don aftir these wordis almest eiyte daies, and he took Petre and James and Joon, and he stiede in to an hil, to preye. 
And while he preiede, the licnesse of his cheer was chaungid, and his clothing was whit schynynge. 
And lo! two men spaken with hym, 
and Moises and Helie weren seen in maieste; and thei sayn his goyng out, which he schulde fulfille in Jerusalem. 
And Petre, and thei that weren with hym, weren heuy of sleep, and thei wakynge saien his majeste, and the twey men that stoden with hym. 
And it was don, whanne thei departiden fro hym, Petir seide to Jhesu, Comaundour, it is good that we be here, and make we here thre tabernaclis, oon to thee, and oon to Moises, and oon to Elie. And he wiste not what he schulde seie. 
But while he spak these thingis, a cloude was maad, and ouerschadewide hem; and thei dredden, whanne thei entriden in to the cloude. 
And a vois was maad out of the cloude, and seide, This is my derworth sone, here ye hym. 
And while the vois was maad, Jhesu was foundun aloone. And thei weren stille, and to no man seiden in tho daies ouyt of tho thingis, that thei hadden seyn. 
But it was doon in the dai suynge, whanne thei camen doun of the hil, myche puple mette hem. 
And lo! a man of the cumpany criede, and seide, Maister, Y biseche thee, biholde my sone, for Y haue no mo; and lo! 
a spirit takith hym, and sudenli he crieth, and hurtlith doun, and to-drawith hym with fome, and vnneth he goith awei al to-drawynge hym. 
And Y preiede thi disciplis, that thei schulden caste hym out, and thei myyten not. 
And Jhesus answerde and seide to hem, A! vnfeithful generacioun and weiward, hou long schal Y be at you, and suffre you? brynge hidur thi sone. 
And whanne he cam nyy, the deuel hurtlide hym doun, and to-braidide hym. And Jhesus blamyde `the vnclene spirit, and heelide the child, and yeldide him to his fadir. 
And alle men wondriden greetli in the gretnesse of God. And whanne alle men wondriden in alle thingis that he dide, he seide to hise disciplis, 
Putte ye these wordis in youre hertis, for it is to come, that mannus sone be bitrayed in to the hondis of men. 
And thei knewen not this word, and it was hid bifor hem, that thei feeliden it not; and thei dredden to axe hym of this word. 
But a thouyt entride in to hem, who of hem schulde be grettest. 
And Jhesu, seynge the thouytis of the herte of hem, took a child, and settide hym bisidis hym; 
and seide to hem, Who euer resseyueth this child in my name, resseyueth me; and who euer resseyueth me, resseiueth him that sente me; for he that is leest among you alle, is the grettest. 
And Joon answeride and seide, Comaundoure, we sayn a man castynge out feendis in thi name, and we han forbedun hym, for he sueth not thee with vs. 
And Jhesus seide to hym, Nyle ye forbede, for he that is not ayens vs, is for vs. 
And it was don, whanne the daies of his takyng vp weren fulfillid, he settide faste his face, to go to Jerusalem, 
and sente messangeris bifor his siyt. And thei yeden, and entriden in to a citee of Samaritans, to make redi to hym. 
And thei resseyueden not hym, for the face `was of hym goynge in to Jerusalem. 
And whanne James and Joon, hise disciplis, seyn, thei seiden, Lord, wolt thou that we seien, that fier come doun fro heuene, and waste hem? 
And he turnede, and blamyde hem, and seide, Ye witen not, whos spiritis ye ben; 
for mannus sone cam not to leese mennus soulis, but to saue. And thei wenten in to another castel. 
And it was don, whanne thei walkeden in the weie, a man seide to hym, Y schal sue thee, whidur euer thou go. 
And Jhesus seide to hym, Foxis han dennes, and briddis of the eir han nestis, but mannus sone hath not where he reste his heed. 
And he seide to another, Sue thou me. And he seide, Lord, suffre me first to go, and birie my fadir. 
And Jhesus seide to hym, Suffre that deede men birie hir deede men; but go thou, and telle the kyngdom of God. 
And another seide, Lord, Y schal sue thee, but first suffre me to leeue `alle thingis that ben at hoom. 
And Jhesus seide to hym, No man that puttith his hoond to the plouy, and biholdynge bacward, is able to the rewme of God.
