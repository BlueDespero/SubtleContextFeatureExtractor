Exodus.
Chapter 12.
Also the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron in the lond of Egipt, 
This monethe, the bigynnyng of monethis to you, schal be the firste in the monethis of the yeer. 
Speke ye to al the cumpanye of the sones of Israel, and seie ye to hem, In the tenthe dai of this monethe ech man take a lomb by hise meynees and housis; 
but if the noumbre is lesse, that it may not suffice to ete the lomb, he schal take his neiybore, which is ioyned to his hows, bi the noumbre of soulis, that moun suffice to the etyng of the lomb. 
Forsothe the lomb schal be a male of o yeer, without wem; bi which custom ye schulen take also a kide ; 
and ye schulen kepe hym til to the fouretenthe dai of this monethe; and al the multitude of the sones of Israel schal offre hym at euentid. 
And thei schulen take of his blood, and schulen put on euer either post, and in lyntels, `ether hiyer threschfoldis, of the housis, in whiche thei schulen ete hym; 
and in that niyt thei schulen ete fleischis, roostid with fier, and therf looues, with letusis of the feeld. 
Ye schulen not ete therof ony raw thing, nether sodun in watir, but roostid oneli by fier; ye schulen deuoure the heed with feet and entrailis therof; 
nether ony thing therof schal abide til the morewtid; if ony thing is residue, ye schulen brenne in the fier. 
Forsothe thus ye schulen ete hym; ye schulen girde youre reynes, and ye schulen haue schoon in the feet, and ye schulen holde stauys in hondis, and ye schulen ete hastili; for it is fase, that is, the passyng of the Lord. 
And Y schal passe thorou the lond of Egipt in that niyt, and Y schal smyte al the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro man til to beeste; and Y the Lord schal make domes in alle the goddis of Egipt. 
Forsothe blood schal be to you in to signe, in the housis in whiche ye schulen be; and Y schal se the blood, and Y schal passe you; nether a wounde distriynge schal be in you, whanne Y schal smyte the lond of Egipt. 
Forsothe ye schulen haue this dai in to mynde, and `ye schulen make it solempne to the Lord in youre generaciouns bi euerlastynge worschipyng. 
In seuene daies ye schulen ete therf breed; in the firste dai no thing diyt with sour douy schal be in youre housis; who euer schal ete ony thing diyt with sour douy, fro the firste dai til the seuenthe dai, that soule schal perische fro Israel. 
The firste day schal be hooli and solempne, and the seuenthe dai schal be worschipful bi the same halewyng; ye schulen not do ony werk in tho daies, outakun these thingis that perteynen to mete; 
and ye schulen kepe therf breed. For in that same dai Y schal lede out of the lond of Egipt youre oost; and ye schulen kepe this dai in youre generaciouns bi euerlastynge custom. 
In the first monethe, in the fouretenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, ye schulen ete therf breed, til to the oon and twentithe dai of the same monethe at euentid. 
In seuene dayes no thing `diyt with sour douy schal be foundun in youre housis; if ony etith ony thing diyt with sour dow, his soule schal perische fro the cumpeny of Israel, as wel of comelyngis, as of hem that ben borun in the lond. 
Ye schulen not ete ony thing diyt with sour dow, and ye schulen ete therf breed in alle youre dwellyng placis. 
Forsothe Moises clepide alle the eldre men of the sones of Israel, and seide to hem, Go ye, and take a beeste by youre meynees, and offre ye fase; and dippe ye a bundel of isope, 
in the blood which `is in the threisfold, and sprynge ye therof the lyntel, and euer either post; noon of you schal go out at the dore of his hows til the morewtid. 
For the Lord schal passe smytynge Egipcians; and whanne he schal se the blood in the lyntel, and in euer either post, he schal passe the dore of the hows; and he schal not suffre the smytere to entre in to youre housis, and to hirte. 
Kepe thou this word; it schal be a lawful thing to thee and to thi sones til in to with outen ende. 
And whanne ye schulen entre in to the lond which the Lord schal yyue to you, as he bihiyte, ye schulen kepe these cerymonyes; 
and whanne youre sones schulen seie to you, What is this religioun? ye schulen seie to hem, 
It is the sacrifice of the passyng of the Lord, whanne he passide ouer the housis of the sones of Israel in Egipt, and smoot Egipcians, and delyueride oure housis. And the puple was bowid, and worschipide. 
And the sones of Israel yeden out, and diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises and to Aaron. 
Forsothe it was doon in the myddis of the nyyt, the Lord smoot al the firste gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt, fro the firste gendrid of Farao, that sat in the trone of hym, til to the first gendrid of the caitif womman, that was in the prisoun, and alle the first gendrid of beestis. 
And Farao roos in the nyyt, and alle hise seruauntis, and al Egipt; and a greet cry was maad in Egipt, for noon hows was, in which a deed man lay not. 
And whanne Moises and Aaron weren clepid in the nyyt, Farao seide, Rise ye, go ye out fro my puple, bothe ye and the sones of Israel; go ye, offre ye to the Lord, as ye seien; 
take ye youre scheep and greete beestis, as ye axiden; and go ye, and blesse ye me. 
And Egipcians constreyneden the puple to go out of the lond swiftli, and seiden, All we schulen die! 
Therfor the puple took meele spreynd togidere, bifor that it was diyt with sour douy; and boond in mentils, and puttide on her schuldris. 
And the sones of Israel diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises; and thei axiden of Egipcians siluerne vesselis and goldun, and ful myche clooth. 
Forsothe the Lord yaf grace to the puple bifor Egipcians, that the Egipcians lenten to hem; and thei maden bare Egipcians. 
And the sones of Israel yeden forth fro Ramasses in to Socoth, almest sixe hundrid thousind of foot men, with out litle children and wymmen; 
but also comyn puple of malis and femalis vnnoumbrable stieden with hem; scheep, and oxun, and ful many beestis of diuerse kynde, stieden with hem. 
And thei bakiden meele, which spreynd to gidere `a while ago thei token fro Egipt, and maden therf looues bakun vnder the aischis; for the looues miyten not be diyt with sour dow, for Egipcians compelliden to go out, and suffriden not to make ony tariyng, nether it was leiser to make ony seew. 
Forsothe the dwellyng of the sones of Israel, bi which thei dwelliden in Egipt, was of foure hundrid and thretti yeer ; 
and whanne tho weren fillid, al the oost of the Lord yede out of the lond of Egipt in the same dai. 
This nyyt is worthi to be kept in the worschipyng of the Lord, whanne he ladde hem out of the lond of Egipt; alle the sones of Israel owen to kepe this in her generaciouns. 
Also the Lord seide to Moises and Aaron, This is the religioun of fase; ech alien schal not ete therof; 
sotheli ech seruaunt bouyt schal be circumcidid, and so he schal ete; 
a comelyng and hirid man schulen not ete therof; 
it schal be etun in oon hows; nether ye schulen bere out of the fleischis therof; nether ye schulen breke a boon therof. 
Ech company of the sones of Israel schal make that fase; 
that if ony pilgrym wole passe into youre feith and worschipyng, and make fase of the Lord, ech male kynde of hym schal be circumcidid bifore, and thanne he schal make lawfuli, and he schal be to gidere as a man borun of the lond; forsothe if ony man is not circumcidid, he schal not ete therof. 
The same lawe schal be to a man borun of the lond, and to a comelyng, that takith youre feith, which is a pilgrym anentis you. 
And alle the sones of Israel diden as the Lord comaundide to Moises and Aaron. 
And in the same dai the Lord ladde out of `the lond of Egipt the sones of Israel, bi her cumpanies.
