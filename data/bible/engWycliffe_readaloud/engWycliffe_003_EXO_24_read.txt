Also he seide to Moises, `Stie thou to the Lord, thou, and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abyu, and seuenti eldere men of Israel; and ye schulen worschipe afer, 
and Moises aloone stie to the Lord, and thei schulen not neiye, nether the puple schal stie with hym. 
Therfore Moises cam, and telde to the puple alle the wordis and domes of the Lord; and al the puple answeride with o vois, We schulen do alle the wordis of the Lord, whiche he spak. 
Forsothe Moises wroot alle the wordis of the Lord; and he roos eerli, and bildide an auter to the Lord at the rootis of the hil, and he bildide twelue titlis bi twelue lynagis of Israel. 
And he sente yonge men of the sones of Israel, and thei offriden brent sacrifices, and `thei offriden pesible sacrifices `to the Lord, twelue calues. 
And so Moises took half the part of the blood, and sente in to grete cuppis; forsothe he schedde the residue part on the auter. 
And he took the book of the boond of pees, and redde, while the puple herde; whiche seiden, We schulen do alle thingis which the Lord spak, and we schulen be obedient. 
Forsothe he took, and sprengide `the blood on the puple, and seide, This is the blood of the boond of pees, which the Lord couenauntide with yow on alle these wordis. 
And Moises, and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abyu, and seuenti of the eldere men of Israel stieden, 
and seiyen God of Israel, vndur hise feet, as the werk of safire stoon, and as heuene whanne it is cleer. 
And he sente not his hond on hem of the sones of Israel, that hadden go fer awei; and thei sien God, and eeten and drunkun. 
Forsothe the Lord seide to Moises, `Stie thou to me in to the hil, and be thou there, and Y schal yyue to thee tablis of stoon, and the lawe, and comaundementis, whiche Y haue write, that thou teche the children of Israel. 
Moises and Josue his mynystre risen, and Moises stiede in to the hil of God, 
and seide to the eldere men, Abide ye here, til we turnen ayen to you; ye han Aaron and Hur with you, if ony thing of questioun is maad, ye schulen telle to hem. 
And whanne Moises hadde stied, 
a cloude hilide the hil, and the glorie of the Lord dwellide on Synai, and kyueride it with a cloude sixe daies; forsothe in the seuenthe dai the Lord clepide hym fro the myddis of the cloude; forsothe the licnesse of glorie of the Lord 
was as fier brennynge on the cop of the hil in the siyt of the sones of Israel. 
And Moises entride into the myddis of the cloude, and stiede in to the hil, and he was there fourti daies and fourti nyytis.
