John.
Chapter 19.
Therfor Pilat took thanne Jhesu, and scourgide. 
And kniytis writhen a coroun of thornes, and setten on his heed, and diden aboute hym a cloth of purpur, 
and camen to him, and seiden, Heil, kyng of Jewis. And thei yauen to him buffatis. 
Eftsoone Pilat wente out, and seide to hem, Lo! Y brynge hym out to you, that ye knowe, that Y fynde no cause in him. 
And so Jhesus wente out, berynge a coroun of thornes, and a cloth of purpur. And he seith to hem, Lo! the man. 
But whanne the bischopis and mynystris hadden seyn hym, thei crieden, and seiden, Crucifie, crucifie hym. Pilat seith to hem, Take ye hym, and crucifie ye, for Y fynde no cause in hym. 
The Jewis answeriden to hym. We han a lawe, and bi the lawe he owith to die, for he made hym Goddis sone. 
Therfor whanne Pilat hadde herd this word, he dredde the more. 
And he wente in to the moot halle eftsoone, and seide to Jhesu, Of whennus art thou? But Jhesus yaf noon answere to him. 
Pilat seith to him, Spekist thou not to me? Woost thou not, that Y haue power to crucifie thee, and Y haue power to delyuere thee? 
Jhesus answeride, Thou schuldist not `haue ony power ayens me, but it were youun to thee from aboue; therfor he that bitook me to thee, hath the more synne. 
Fro that tyme Pilat souyte to delyuere hym; but the Jewis crieden, and seiden, If thou delyuerist this man, thou art not the emperouris freend; for ech man that makith hym silf king, ayen seith the emperoure. 
And Pilat, whanne he hadde herd these wordis, ledde Jhesu forth, and sat for domesman in a place, that is seid Licostratos, but in Ebrew Golgatha. 
And it was pask eue, as it were the sixte our. And he seith to the Jewis, Lo! youre king. 
But thei crieden, and seiden, Take awei, take awei; crucifie him. Pilat seith to hem, Schal I crucifie youre king? The bischops answeriden, We han no king but the emperour. 
And thanne Pilat bitook him to hem, that he schulde be crucified. And thei token Jhesu, and ledden him out. 
And he bar to hym silf a cros, and wente out in to that place, that is seid of Caluarie, in Ebreu Golgatha; 
where thei crucifieden him, and othere tweyne with him, oon on this side and oon on that side, and Jhesus in the myddil. 
And Pilat wroot a title, and sette on the cros; and it was writun, Jhesu of Nazareth, king of Jewis. 
Therfor manye of the Jewis redden this title, for the place where Jhesus was crucified, was niy the citee, and it was writun in Ebreu, Greek, and Latyn. 
Therfor the bischops of the Jewis seiden to Pilat, Nyle thou write kyng of Jewis, but for he seide, Y am king of Jewis. 
Pilat answeride, That that Y haue writun, Y haue writun. 
Therfor the knyytis whanne thei hadden crucified hym, token hise clothis, and maden foure partis, to ech knyyt a part, and a coot. And the coot was without seem, and wouun al aboute. 
Therfor thei seiden togidere, Kitte we not it, but caste we lot, whos it is; that the scripture be fulfillid, seiynge, Thei partiden my clothis to hem, and on my cloth thei casten lot. And the kniytis diden these thingis. 
But bisidis the cros of Jhesu stoden his modir, and the sistir of his modir, Marie Cleofe, and Marie Maudeleyne. 
Therfor whanne Jhesu hadde seyn his modir, and the disciple stondynge, whom he louyde, he seith to hise modir, Womman, lo thi sone. 
Aftyrward he seith to the disciple, Lo! thi modir. And fro that our the disciple took hir in to his modir. 
Aftirward Jhesus witynge, that now alle thingis ben endid, that the scripture were fulfillid, he seith, Y thirste. 
And a vessel was set ful of vynegre. And thei `leiden in isope aboute the spounge ful of vynegre, and putten to his mouth. 
Therfor whanne Jhesus hadde `takun the vynegre, he seid, It is endid. And `whanne his heed was bowid doun, `he yaf vp the goost. 
Therfor for it was the pask eue, that the bodies schulden not abide on the cros in the sabat, for that was a greet sabat dai, the Jewis preiden Pilat, that the hipis of hem schulden be brokun, and thei takun awei. 
Therfor knyytis camen, and thei braken the thies of the firste, and of the tothere, that was crucified with hym. 
But whanne thei weren comun to Jhesu, as thei sayn him deed thanne, thei braken not hise thies; 
but oon of the knyytis openyde his side with a spere, and anoon blood and watir wenten out. 
And he that saiy, bare witnessyng, and his witnessing is trewe; and he woot that he seith trewe thingis, that ye bileue. 
And these thingis weren don, that the scripture schulde be fulfillid, Ye schulen not breke a boon of hym. 
And eftsoone another scripture seith, Thei schulen se in whom thei piyten thorow. 
But after these thingis Joseph of Armathi preyede Pilat, that he schulde take awei the bodi of Jhesu, for that he was a disciple of Jhesu, but priui for drede of the Jewis. And Pilat suffride. And so he cam, and took awei the bodi of Jhesu. 
And Nychodeme cam also, that hadde come to hym first bi nyyt, and brouyte a meddlynge of myrre and aloes, as it were an hundrid pound. 
And thei token the bodi of Jhesu, and boundun it in lynun clothis with swete smellynge oynementis, as it is custom to Jewis for to birie. 
And in the place where he was crucified, was a yerd, and in the yerd a newe graue, in which yit no man was leid. 
Therfor there thei putten Jhesu, for the vigilie of Jewis feeste, for the sepulcre was niy.
