Matthew.
Chapter 7.
Nile ye deme, `that ye be not demed; for in what doom ye demen, 
ye schulen be demed, and in what mesure ye meten, it schal be meten ayen to you. 
But what seest thou a litil mote in the iye of thi brother, and seest not a beem in thin owne iye? 
Or hou seist thou to thi brothir, Brothir, suffre I schal do out a mote fro thin iye, and lo! a beem is in thin owne iye? 
Ipocrite, `do thou out first the beem of thin iye, and thanne thou schalt se to do out the mote of the iye of thi brothir. 
Nile ye yyue hooli thing to houndis, nethir caste ye youre margaritis bifore swyne, lest perauenture thei defoulen hem with her feet, and the houndis be turned, and al to-tere you. 
Axe ye, and it schal be youun to you; seke ye, and ye schulen fynde; knocke ye, and it schal be openyd to you. 
For ech that axith, takith; and he that sekith, fyndith; and it schal be openyd to hym, that knockith. 
What man of you is, that if his sone axe hym breed, whethir he wole take hym a stoon? 
Or if he axe fische, whether he wole take hym an edder? 
Therfor if ye, whanne ye ben yuele men, kunnen yyue good yiftis to youre sones, hou myche more youre fadir that is in heuenes schal yyue good thingis to men that axen hym? 
Therfor alle thingis, what euere thingis ye wolen that men do to you, do ye to hem, for this is the lawe and the prophetis. 
Entre ye bi the streyt yate; for the yate that ledith to perdicioun is large, and the weie is broode, and there ben many that entren bi it. 
Hou streit is the yate, and narwy the weye, that ledith to lijf, and ther ben fewe that fynden it. 
Be ye war of fals prophetis, that comen to you in clothingis of scheep, but withynneforth thei ben as wolues of raueyn; 
of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem. Whether men gaderen grapis of thornes, or figus of breris? 
So euery good tre makith good fruytis; but an yuel tre makith yuel fruytis. 
A good tre may not make yuel fruytis, nethir an yuel tre make good fruytis. 
Euery tre that makith not good fruyt, schal be kyt doun, and schal be cast in to the fier. 
Therfor of her fruytis ye schulen knowe hem. 
Not ech man that seith to me, Lord, Lord, schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes; but he that doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes, he schal entre in to the kyngdoom of heuenes. 
Many schulen seie to me in that dai, Lord, Lord, whether we han not prophesied in thi name, and han caste out feendis in thi name, and han doon many vertues in thi name? 
And thanne Y schal knouleche to hem, That Y knewe you neuere; departe awei fro me, ye that worchen wickidnesse. 
Therfor ech man that herith these my wordis, and doith hem, schal be maad lijk to a wise man, that hath bildid his hous on a stoon. 
And reyn felde doun, and flodis camen, and wyndis blewen, and russchiden `in to that hous; and it felde not doun, for it was foundun on a stoon. 
And euery man that herith these my wordis, and doith hem not, is lijk to a fool, that hath bildid his hous on grauel. 
And reyn cam doun, and floodis camen, and wyndis blewen, and thei hurliden ayen that hous; and it felde doun, and the fallyng doun therof was greet. 
And it was doon, whanne Jhesus hadde endid these wordis, the puple wondride on his techyng; 
for he tauyte hem, as he that hadde power, and not as the scribis `of hem, and the Farisees.
