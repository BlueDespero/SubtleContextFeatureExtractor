Luke.
Chapter 18.
And he seide to hem also a parable, that it bihoueth to preye euer more, and not faile; 
and seide, There was a iuge in a citee, that dredde not God, nether schamede of men. 
And a widowe was in that citee, and sche cam to hym, and seide, Venge me of myn aduersarie; 
and he wolde not longe tyme. But aftir these thingis he seide with ynne hym silf, Thouy Y drede not God, and schame not of man, 
netheles for this widewe is heuy to me, Y schal venge hir; lest at the laste sche comynge condempne me. 
And the Lord seide, Here ye, what the domesman of wickidnesse seith; 
and whether God schal not do veniaunce of hise chosun, criynge to hym dai and nyyt, and schal haue pacience in hem? 
Sotheli Y seie to you, for soone he schal do veniaunce of hem. Netheles gessist thou, that mannus sone comynge schal fynde feith in erthe? 
And he seide also to sum men, that tristiden in hem silf, as thei weren riytful, and dispiseden othere, this parable, 
seiynge, Twei men wenten vp in to the temple to preye; the toon a Farisee, and the tother a pupplican. 
And the Farisee stood, and preiede bi hym silf these thingis, and seide, God, Y do thankyngis to thee, for Y am not as other men, raueinouris, vniust, auoutreris, as also this pupplican; 
Y faste twies in the woke, Y yyue tithis of alle thingis that Y haue in possessioun. 
And the pupplican stood afer, and wolde nether reise hise iyen to heuene, but smoot his brest, and seide, God be merciful to me, synnere. 
Treuli Y seie to you, this yede doun in to his hous, and was iustified fro the other. For ech that enhaunsith hym, schal be maad low, and he that mekith hym, schal be enhaunsid. 
And thei brouyten to hym yonge children, that he schulde touche hem; and whanne the disciplis saien this thing, thei blameden hem. 
But Jhesus clepide togider hem, and seide, Suffre ye children to come to me, and nyle ye forbede hem, for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes. 
Treuli Y seie to you, who euer schal not take the kyngdom of God as a child, he schal not entre in to it. 
And a prince axide hym, and seide, Goode maister, in what thing doynge schal Y weilde euerlastynge lijf? 
And Jhesus seide to hym, What seist thou me good? No man is good, but God aloone. 
Thou knowist the comaundementis, Thou schalt not sle, Thou schalt not do letcherie, Thou schalt not do theft, Thou schalt not seie fals witnessyng, Worschipe thi fadir and thi modir. 
Which seide, Y haue kept alle these thingis fro my yongthe. 
And whanne this thing was herd, Jhesus seide to hym, Yit o thing failith `to thee; sille thou alle thingis that thou hast, and yyue to pore men, and thou schalt haue tresour in heuene; and come, and sue thou me. 
Whanne these thingis weren herd, he was soreful, for he was ful ryche. 
And Jhesus seynge hym maad sorie, seide, How hard thei that han money schulen entre in to the kyngdom of God; 
for it is liyter a camel to passe thorou a nedlis iye, than a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of God. 
And thei that herden these thingis seiden, Who may be maad saaf? 
And he seide to hem, Tho thingis that ben impossible anentis men, ben possible anentis God. 
But Petir seide, Lo! we han left alle thingis, and han sued thee. 
And he seide to hym, Treuli Y seie to you, there is no man that schal forsake hous, or fadir, modir, or britheren, or wijf, or children, or feeldis, for the rewme of God, 
and schal not resseyue many mo thingis in this tyme, and in the world to comynge euerlastynge lijf. 
And Jhesus took hise twelue disciplis, and seide to hem, Lo! we gon vp to Jerusalem, and alle thingis schulen be endid, that ben writun bi the prophetis of mannus sone. 
For he schal be bitraied to hethen men, and he schal be scorned, and scourgid, and bispat; 
and aftir that thei han scourgid, thei schulen sle hym, and the thridde dai he schal rise ayen. 
And thei vndurstoden no thing of these; and this word was hid fro hem, and thei vndurstoden not tho thingis that weren seid. 
But it was don, whanne Jhesus cam nyy to Jerico, a blynde man sat bisidis the weie, and beggide. 
And whanne he herde the puple passynge, he axide, what this was. 
And thei seiden to hym, that Jhesus of Nazareth passide. 
And he criede, and seide, Jhesu, the sone of Dauyd, haue mercy on me. 
And thei that wenten bifor blamyden hym, that he schulde be stille; but he criede myche the more, Thou sone of Dauid, haue mercy on me. 
And Jhesus stood, and comaundide hym to be brouyt forth to hym. And whanne he cam nyy, he axide hym, 
and seide, What wolt thou that Y schal do to thee? And he seide, Lord, that Y se. 
And Jhesus seide to hym, Biholde; thi feith hath maad thee saaf. 
And anoon he say, and suede hym, and magnyfiede God. And al the puple, as it say, yaf heriyng to God.
