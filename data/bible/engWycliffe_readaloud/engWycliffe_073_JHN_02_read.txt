Chapter 2.
And the thridde dai weddyngis weren maad in the Cane of Galilee; and the modir of Jhesu was there. 
And Jhesus was clepid, and hise disciplis, to the weddyngis. 
And whanne wijn failide, the modir of Jhesu seide to hym, Thei han not wijn. 
And Jhesus seith to hir, What to me and to thee, womman? myn our cam not yit. 
His modir seith to the mynystris, What euere thing he seie to you, do ye. 
And there weren set `sixe stonun cannes, aftir the clensyng of the Jewis, holdynge ech tweyne ether thre metretis. 
And Jhesus seith to hem, Fille ye the pottis with watir. And thei filliden hem, vp to the mouth. 
And Jhesus seide to hem, Drawe ye now, and bere ye to the architriclyn. And thei baren. 
And whanne the architriclyn hadde tastid the watir maad wiyn, and wiste not wherof it was, but the mynystris wisten that drowen the watir, the architriclyn clepith the spouse, 
and seith to hym, Ech man settith first good wiyn, and whanne men ben fulfillid, thanne that that is worse; but thou hast kept the good wiyn `in to this tyme. 
Jhesus dide this the bigynnyng of signes in the Cane of Galilee, and schewide his glorie; and hise disciplis bileueden in hym. 
Aftir these thingis he cam doun to Cafarnaum, and his modir, and hise britheren, and hise disciplis; and thei dwelliden `there not many daies. 
And the pask of Jewis was nyy, and Jhesus wente vp to Jerusalem. 
And he foond in the temple men sillynge oxun, and scheep, and culueris, and chaungeris sittynge. 
And whanne he hadde maad as it were a scourge of smale cordis, he droof out alle of the temple, and oxun, and scheep; and he schedde the money of chaungeris, and turnede vpsedoun the boordis. 
And he seide to hem that selden culueris, Take awei fro hennus these thingis, and nyle ye make the hous of my fadir an hous of marchaundise. 
And hise disciplis hadden mynde, for it was writun, The feruent loue of thin hous hath etun me. 
Therfor the Jewis answeriden, and seiden to hym, What token schewist thou to vs, that thou doist these thingis? 
Jhesus answerde, and seide to hem, Vndo ye this temple, and in thre daies Y schal reise it. 
Therfor the Jewis seiden to hym, In fourti and sixe yeer this temple was bildid, and schalt thou in thre daies reise it? 
But he seide of the temple of his bodi. 
Therfor whanne he was risun fro deeth, hise disciplis hadden mynde, that he seide these thingis of his bodi; and thei bileueden to the scripture, and to the word that Jhesus seide. 
And whanne Jhesus was at Jerusalem in pask, in the feeste dai, many bileueden in his name, seynge his signes that he dide. 
But Jhesus trowide not hym silf to hem, for he knewe alle men; 
and for it was not nede to hym, that ony man schulde bere witnessyng, for he wiste, what was in man.
