Leviticus.
Chapter 5.
And if a man sin, and (one) hear the voice (which demands) swearing that he is a witness, or that he hath seen or known, if he will not show it, he shall bear his sin. 
Or if a man shall have touched anything unclean, whether the carcase of an unclean beast, or the carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of an unclean reptile, and it be hidden from him, he shall be defiled and guilty. 
Or if he shall touch the uncleanness of a man, any uncleanness which defileth him, and it be hidden from him; but (afterwards) becometh aware of it and is guilty; 
Or if a man swear, declaring with his lips, for evil or for good, according to whatever the man shall declare by oath, and (the truth) be hidden from him, and he (afterwards) have knowledge thereof, he is guilty of one of these. 
And it shall be that when (he knoweth that) he is guilty in one of these (things) he shall confess that he hath sinned thereby; 
And shall bring his sin offering before the Lord for the sin that he hath sinned; a she-lamb from the flock, or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall atone for him and for his sin. 
But if his hands be not sufficient to offer a lamb, let him bring for the sin that he hath sinned two turtle doves, or two young pigeons before the Lord, one for the sin offering, and one for the burnt sacrifice. 
And he shall bring them to the priest, and he shall offer the sin offering first, and wring off its head near to the spine, but he shall not divide (the bird). 
And he shall sprinkle the blood of the sin offering upon the side (wall) of the altar, and pour out the remainder of the blood at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering. 
And the second he shall make a burnt sacrifice, according to the proper (rite); and the priest shall make atonement for the sin that he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him. 
But if (neither) two turtle doves nor a pair of young pigeons pertain to him, he shall bring, as his oblation for the sin that he hath sinned, the tenth of three sein of flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil upon it, nor put frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering. 
And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it at the altar with the oblations of the Lord: it is a sin offering. 
And the priest shall make atonement for him, for the sin that he hath sinned in anyone of these (things), and it shall be forgiven him: and to the priest it shall be, as the mincha. 
And the Lord spake with Mosheh, saying: 
When a man hath indeed falsified, but hath sinned inadvertently concerning things consecrated to the Lord, he shall bring for his trespass offering before the Lord a ram without blemish from the flock by its value in silver shekels, in the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering. 
And that which he had defaulted of the holy thing he shall make good, and add a fifth thereupon, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him. 
And if a man sin and do against any of the commandments of the Lord that which is not right to do, and know not, and sin, he shall bear his sin. 
But he shall bring a lamb unblemished form the flock according to the estimation for a trespass offering (or according to the estimation of the trespass) unto the priest; and the priest shall atone for his error which he hath committed unwittingly, and it shall be forgiven him. 
It is a trepass offering for the sin that he hath sinned; he shall offer the trespass offering before the Lord. 
And the Lord spake with Mosheh, saying: 
If a man sin and falsify with falsehood before the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbour in a thing deposited, or in fellowship of hands, or by rapine or violence against his neighbour; 
Or if he have found that which had been lost and deny it, and swear falsely, by anyone of all these which a man doeth and sinneth therein; 
It shall be that when he hath (so) transgressed and become guilty, he shall return what he hath robbed by robbery, or taken away by violence, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing that he had found: 
Or all that about which he had sworn falsely, he shall make it good in the capital, and add one fifth thereon; unto him to whom it belongeth shall he give it on the day of his (offering for) guilt. 
And the trespass offering that he shall bring before the Lord (must be) a ram unblemished form the flock according to the estimation of the trespass, unto the priest. 
And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiven him for anyone of all (these) in which he may have acted to be guilty thereby.
