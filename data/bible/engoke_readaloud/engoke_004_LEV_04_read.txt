Leviticus.
Chapter 4.
And the Lord spake with Mosheh, saying: 
Speak with the sons of Israel, saying: When a man sinneth through ignorance of any of the precepts of the Lord, as to that which should not be done, and acteth contrary to one of them: 
If the high priest sin after the manner of the people’s sin, let him bring before the Lord for the sin that he hath sinned a young bullock without blemish for his sin. 
And he shall bring the bullock to the door of the tabernacle of ordinance before the Lord, and lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and slay the bullock before the Lord. 
And the high priest shall take of the blood of the bullock and carry it into the tabernacle of ordinance. 
And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle (some) of the blood seven times in the presence of the Lord before the veil of the sanctuary. 
And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord in the tabernacle of ordinance, and all the (remaining) blood of the bullock he shall pour out at the foundation of the altar of burnt sacrifice which is at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance. 
And all the fat of the bullock of the sin offering he shall separate from it; the fat which covereth the inwards, and all the fat which is upon the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them that is by the flanks; and the caul that is upon the liver, together with the kidneys, he shall remove, 
as it was separated from the bullock of the consecrated victims, and the priest shall offer it upon the altar of burnt sacrifice. 
But the skin of the bullock and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his food, 
he shall carry forth, even the whole bullock, without the camp unto a clean place, to a place for the pouring out of ashes, and burn him upon wood in the fire; at the place for the pouring out of ashes shall he be burned. 
And if the whole congregation (kenishta) of Israel shall mistake, and the thing be hid form the eyes of the assembly, (kehala), and they shall have done (somewhat against) one of all the commandments of the Lord which it is not right to do, and have become guilty; 
When the sin that they have sinned is known, the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin offering, and bring him before the tabernacle of ordinance. 
And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock in the presence of the Lord, and kill the bullock before the Lord. 
And the high priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock into the tabernacle of ordinance; 
And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle seven times in the presence of the Lord before the veil. 
And some of the blood he shall put upon the horns of the altar that is before the Lord in the tabernacle of ordinance, and all (the rest of the) blood he shall pour out at the foundation of the altar of burnt sacrifice which is at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance. 
And all the fat he shall separate from him, and sacrifice at the altar. 
And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock of the sin offering, so shall he do with him; and the priest shall atone for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 
And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the former bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation. 
Should a ruler sin and do (contrary to) any of the commandments of the Lord his God what is not right to do, through ignorance, and be guilty; 
When his sin becomes known to him in what he hath transgressed, he shall bring his oblation, a kid of the goats, a male, unblemished; 
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill him at the place where the burnt sacrifice is slain before the Lord; it is a sin offering. 
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice, and pour out the blood at the foundation of the altar of burnt sacrifice. 
And he shall burn all the fat at the altar, as the fat of the sanctified oblation (is burned); and the priest shall atone on his behalf for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 
And if one of the people of the land inadvertently sin in doing contrary to any of the commandments of the Lord what is not right to do, and become guilty; 
When his sin is known to him, in what he hath sinned, he shall bring his oblation, a female kid of the goats, unblemished, for the sin that he hath sinned. 
And he shall lay his hand on the lead of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering at the place of burnt sacrifice; 
And the priest shall take of the blood with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out all the blood at the foundation of the altar. 
And he shall remove all the fat, as he took away the fat from the consecrated offerings, and the priest shall burn it at the altar, to be received with acceptance before the Lord; and the priest shall atone for him, and it shall be forgiven him. 
But if he present a lamb for his sin offering, he shall bring a female unblemished, 
and lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering at the place where the burnt sacrifice is killed. 
And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice, and pour out all the blood at the foundation of the altar. 
And he shall remove all the fat, as he removed the fat of the lamb of the sanctified oblations, and the priest shall burn it at the altar with the oblations of the Lord; and the priest shall atone for him, for the sin that he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
