Genesis.
Chapter 12.
And the Lord said to ABRAM, Go thou away from thy country, and from the house of thy father, to the land which I will show thee. 
And I will make thee to (be) a great people, and will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed. 
And I will bless him who blesseth thee, and him who curseth thee I will curse; and through thee all the progenies of the earth shall be blessed. 
And Abram went away, according as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was a son of seventy and five years in his forthgoing from Charan. 
And Abram took Sara his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all the possessions which they possessed, and the souls whom they had made subject to the law in Charan, and went forth to go into the land of Kenaan; and they came unto the land of Kenaan. 
And Abram traversed through the land unto the place of Shekim unto the plain of Moreh; and the Kenaanah was then in the land. 
And the Lord revealed Himself unto Abram, and said, To thy sons will I give this land. And he builded there an altar before the Lord who had been revealed to him. 
And he ascended from thence to the mountain east of Beth El, and spread out his tabernacle, having Beth El on the west and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar before the Lord, and prayed in the name of the Lord. 
And Abram migrated, going and migrating to the south. 
And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Mizraim, to sojourn there, because the famine was strong in the land. 
And it was that as he drew nigh to enter Mizraim he said to Sara his wife, Behold, now I know that thou art a woman beautiful in sight; 
And it will be that when the Mizraee see thee they will say, This is his wife; and they will kill me, and thee will they reserve. 
Say now, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me through thee, and my life may be preserved through thy words. 
And it was that when Abram had entered into Mizraim, the Mizraee saw the woman that she was singularly fair; 
And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and extolled her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken to the house of Pharaoh. 
And Abram was well treated on account of her. And he had sheep, and oxen, and asses, and servants, and maidens, and camels. 
And the Lord brought upon Pharaoh great plagues, and upon the men of his house, for the affair of Sara the wife of Abram. 
And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not show me that she is thy wife? 
Why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I would have taken her to me to wife? And now, behold thy wife: take, and go. 
And Pharaoh instructed the men concerning him, and they, conducted him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
