Exodus.
Chapter 4.
And Mosheh answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me nor hearken to me: for they will say, The Lord hath no been revealed to thee. 
And the Lord said to him, What is that which is in thy hand? And he said, A rod. 
And He said, Cast it to the ground; and he cast it upon the ground, and it became a serpent, and Mosheh fled from before it. 
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Stretch forth thy hand and seize it by its tail; and he put forth his hand and grasped it, and it became a rod in his hand. 
That they may believe that the Lord god of their fathers hath been revealed to thee, that God of Abraham, the God of Izhak, and the God of Jakob. 
And the Lord said yet to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and drew it out; and, behold, his hand was white as snow. 
And He said, Return thy hand into thy bosom. And he returned his hand into his bosom, and drew it out form his bosom, and, behold, it had turned to be as his own flesh. 
And it shall be, if they will not believe thee nor receive the voice of the first sign, that they shall believe the voice of the latter sign. 
But if they will not believe either of these two signs, nor receive from thee, take of the water that is in the river, and pour it upon the ground; and the water which thou takest form the river shall become blood upon the ground. 
And Mosheh said before the Lord, In entreating, I am not a man who is (well) spoken, neither yesterday nor the day before, and from the time that thou spakest with Thy servant: for I am heavy of speech and of a deep tongue. 
But the Lord said to him, Who hath appointed the mouth of man, and who hath appointed the mute, or the deaf, or the open-sighted, or the blind? Have not I, the Lord? 
And now go, and My Word shall be with thy mouth, and I will teach thee what to say. 
And he said, I beseech the Lord to send by the hand of one who is fit to be sent. 
And the displeasure of the Lord was kindled against Mosheh; and He said, Is not Aharon the Levite, thy brother, known before Me as one who speaking can speak? And also, behold, he cometh forth to anticipate thee, and will see thee, and rejoice in his heart. 
And thou shalt speak with him, and put the words in his mouth; and My Word will be with thy mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what to do. 
And he shall speak for thee with the people, and shall be thy interpreter, and thou shalt be to him a rab; 
And this staff thou shalt take in thy hand wherewith to work the signs. 
And Mosheh went, and returned to Jether his father-in-law, and said to him, I will now go and return to my brethren who are in Mizraim, and see if they still live. And Jether said to Mosheh, Go in peace. 
And the Lord said to Mosheh in Midian, Go, return to Mizraim; for all the men who sought to kill thee are dead. 
And Mosheh took his wife and his sons, and made them ride upon the ass, and returned to the land of Mizraim. And Mosheh took the staff with which the miracles had been done before the Lord in his hand. 
And the Lord said to Mosheh, In thy going to return to Mizraim look to all the wonders that I have appointed by thy hand, and do them before the Pharoh. But I will obdurate his heart, and he will not send the people away. 
And thou shalt say unto Pharoh, Thus said the Lord; Israel is My son, My firstborn. 
And I say unto thee, Let My son go, that he may serve before Me; and if thou refuse to send him away, behold, I will kill thy son, thy firstborn. 
And it was in the way, at the place of lodging, that the Angel of the Lord met him, and sought to kill him. 
And Zipporah took a stone, and circumcised the foreskin of her son, and approached before him, and said, On account of the blood of this circumcision let my husband be given (back) to me. 
And when he had desisted from him, she said, But for the blood of this circumcision my husband would have been condemned to die. 
And the Lord said to Aharon, Go thou to meet Mosheh in the desert. And he went, and met him at the mountain on which was revealed the glory of the Lord, and he kissed him. 
And Mosheh showed Aharon all the words with which the Lord had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded. 
And Mosheh and Aharon went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel; 
And Aharon told all the words which the Lord had spoken with Mosheh, and did the signs in the eyes of the people. 
And the people believed, and understood (heard) that the Lord had remembered the sons of Israel, and that heir slavery was manifest before him; and they bowed, and adored.
