Deuteronomy.
Chapter 18.
For the priests and Levites, (even) all the tribe of Levi, there shall be no part or inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the oblations of the Lord and his inheritance, 
but have no heritage among their brethren, the gifts presented unto the Lord they are his heritage, as the Lord hath said to him. 
And this is what shall appertain to the priests from the people, from them who offer a sacrifice, whether bullock or lamb; they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the cheeks, and the maw. 
The first of thy corn, wine, and oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, thou shalt set apart for him. 
For the Lord thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the Name of the Lord, he, and his sons, all the days. 
And if a Levite come from one of thy cities out of all Israel, where he hath dwelt, and come with all the desire of his soul, to the place which the Lord will choose, 
then he shall minister in the Name of the Lord his God with his brethren the Levites who minister there before the Lord. 
Portion for portion shall they eat, beside the accustomed allotment which cometh on the Sabbath, as the fathers have appointed. 
When thou hast entered into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of these peoples: 
No one shall be found among thee who maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, using enchantments, observing times or augury or witchcraft, 
Nor an incantator, or a consulter at a heathen oracle, or a wizard, or an inquirer from the dead: 
For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord; and because of these abominations the Lord thy God driveth them out from before thee. 
Thou shalt be perfect in the fear of the Lord thy God. 
For these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened to diviners and enchanters; not so hath the Lord given thee to do. 
A PROPHET from among thee, of thy brethren, like me, will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee, to him shall ye hearken. 
According to all that thou didst ask before the Lord thy God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying: Let me not again hear the voice of the Word of the Lord my God, and let me not see the great fire any more, lest I die. 
And the Lord said to me, That which they have spoken is right: 
I will raise up to them a Prophet from among them like unto thee, and I will put My words of prophecy upon his lips, and he will speak to them all that I shall command him. 
And the man who will not hearken to My words which he will speak in My Name, My Word will require it of him. 
But a prophet who shall do wickedly in speaking in My Name a word which I had not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of the gods of the Gentiles, that prophet shall die. 
And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? 
When a prophet speaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the word come not to pass, neither be confirmed, that is a word which the Lord hath not spoken: of the prophet who hath spoken in wickedness thou shalt not be afraid.
