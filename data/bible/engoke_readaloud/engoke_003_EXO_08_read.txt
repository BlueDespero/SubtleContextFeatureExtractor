Exodus.
Chapter 8.
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Say to Aharon, Uplift thy hand with thy staff upon the streams, upon the rivulets, and upon the lakes; and the frogs shall come up on the land of Mizraim. 
And Aharon lifted up his hand over the waters of the Mizraee, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Mizraim. 
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and made frogs to come up on the land of Mizraim. 
And Pharoh called Mosheh and Aharon, and said, Pray before the Lord that the frogs may be removed from me and from my people; and I will release the people, that they may sacrifice before the Lord. 
And Mosheh said to Pharoh, Demand for thyself a miracle, and appoint me a time when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants and thy people, that the frogs may be finished from thee and from thy house, and remain only in the river. 
And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, According to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none as the Lord our God. 
And the frogs shall be removed from thee and from thy house and thy servants and thy people; in the river only shall they remain. 
And Mosheh and Aharon went out from Pharoh; and Mosheh prayed before the Lord concerning the frogs which he had appointed unto Pharoh. 
And the Lord did according to the words of Mosheh; and the frogs died from the houses, and from the courts, and from the fields. 
And they gathered them in heaps (upon) heaps, and they corrupted upon the ground. 
And Pharoh saw that there was relief; and hardened his heart, and would not hearken to them, as the Lord had said. 
And the Lord spake to Mosheh, Say unto Aharon, Lift up thy rod and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall become, insects, in all the land of Mizraim. 
And they did so. And Aharon lifted up his hand with the rod and smote the dust of the earth, and it became insects on man and on cattle; all the dust of the earth became insects in all the land of Mizraim. 
And the magicians wrought so with their enchantments to produce the insects, but were not able; and there were insects on man and on beast. 
And the magicians said to Pharoh, This is a plague from before the Lord. Yet Pharoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not hearken to them, as the Lord had said. 
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Arise in the morning and stand before Pharoh; behold, he goeth out to the waters; and say to him, Thus saith the Lord, Send My people away, that they may serve before Me. 
For if thou wilt not send My people away, behold, I will send on thee, and on thy servants, and on thy people, and upon thy houses, the aroba; I and they shall fill the houses of the Mizraee with the aroba; and also the ground on which they are. 
But I will make a distinction in that day with the land of Goshen where My people dwell, that the aroba shall not be there; so that thou mayest know that I the Lord do rule in the midst of the earth. 
And I will ordain redemption to My people, but upon thy people shall be the plague. Tomorrow shall this sign be. 
And the Lord did so; and the aroba came with strength into the house of Pharoh, and into the house of his servants, and into all the land of Mizraim; and the land was destroyed before the aroba. 
And Pharoh called for Mosheh and Aharon, and said, Go, sacrifice before your God in the land. 
But Mosheh said, It will not be fitting to do so; because the animals which the Mizraee worship we shall take to sacrifice before the Lord our God. Behold, should we immolate the animal which the Mizraee worship, would they not stone us when they saw it? 
A journey of three days will we go into the desert, and sacrifice before the Lord our God, as He hath told us. 
And Pharoh said, I will send you away, that you may sacrifice before the Lord your God in the desert; only you shall not go farther and farther: pray also for me. 
And Mosheh said, Behold I will go out from being with thee, and will pray before the Lord, and He will remove the aroba from Pharoh, and from his servants, and his people, tomorrow; only let Pharoh no more be false in not sending away the people to sacrifice unto the Lord. 
And Mosheh went out from before Pharoh, and prayed before the Lord. 
And the Lord did according to the word of Mosheh, and removed the aroba from. Pharoh and his servants, and his people; not one remained. 
But Pharoh hardened his heart this time also, and would not dismiss the people.
