Deuteronomy.
Chapter 34.
And Mosheh went up from the plains of Moab to the mountains of Nebo, to the summit of the height which is over against Jericho; and the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead unto Dan, 
And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Menasheh, and all the land of Jehudah to the hinder sea, 
And the south, and the country of the plain of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. 
And the Lord said to him, This is the land which I covenanted unto Abraham, Izhak, and Jakob, saying, To thy children will I give it; thou hast seen it with thine eyes, but unto it thou art not to pass over. 
And Mosheh the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of Moab, by the Word of the Lord. 
And He buried him in a valley (or cavity, becheltha) in the land of Moab, over against Beth Peor: but no man knoweth his sepulchre unto this day. 
And Mosheh was a son of a hundred and twenty years when he died: his eye had not dimmed, neither was the radiance of his face changed. 
And the children of Israel wept for Mosheh in the fields of Moab thirty days; and the days of the mourning for Mosheh were completed. 
And Jehoshua bar Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom; for Mosheh had laid his hands upon him, and the children of Israel obeyed him, and did as the Lord had commanded (by) Mosheh. 
But no prophet hath arisen in Israel like unto Mosheh, unto whom the Lord revealed Himself face to face, 
in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to perform in the land of Mizraim upon Pharoh, and on all his servants, and on all his land, 
and all the Mighty Hand, and all the great manifestations which Mosheh wrought in the eyes of all Israel. END OF THE TARGUM OF ONKELOS ON THE TORAH.
