Genesis.
Chapter 11.
And all the earth was of one language and one speech. 
And it was in their migrations at the beginning, that they found a plain in the land of Babel; and dwelt there. 
And they said, a man to his companion, Come, let us cast bricks and bake them in the fire. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 
And they said, Come, let us build a city, and a tower, the bead of it coming to the pinnacle of the heavens. And we will make to us a name, lest we be dispersed upon the face of all the earth. 
And the Lord was revealed to punish the work of the city and the tower which the sons of men had builded. 
And the Lord said, Behold, the people are one and the language one with all of them: and this is what they begin to do. And now nothing will be restrained from them of what they imagine to do. 
Come, We will be manifest, and will confuse their language there, that a man shall not bear the language of his companion. 
And the Lord dispersed them from thence upon the face of all the earth, and they were restrained from building the city. 
Therefore the name of it is called Confusion, because the Lord there confused the tongue of all the earth, and from thence the Lord dispersed them upon the face of all the earth.

And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu. 
And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Reu lived thirty and two years, and begat Serug. 
And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.

And Nachor lived after he had begotten Terach a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Terach lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nachor, and Haran. 
And these are the generations of Terach. Terach begat Abram, Nachor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
And Haran died before Terach his father in the land of his nativity, in Ura of the Kasdaee. 
And Abram and Nachor took to them wives: the name of the wife of Abram, Sara; and the name of the wife of Nachor, Milcha, daughter of Haran the father of Milcha and the father of Yiska. 
And Sara was barren, she had no child. 
And Terach took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, the son of his son, and Sara his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram his son, and went forth with them from Ura of the Kasdaee to go to the land of Kenaan. And they came to Charan, and dwelt there. 
And the days of Terach were two hundred and five years, and Terach died in Charan.
