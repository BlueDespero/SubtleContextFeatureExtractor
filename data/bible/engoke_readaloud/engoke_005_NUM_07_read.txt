Numbers.
Chapter 7.
And it was on the day when Mosheh had completed to set up the tabernacle, and to anoint it, and to consecrate it, and all its vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them, 
That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, the chiefs of the tribes, who had been appointed over them who were numbered, 
came near, and brought their oblations before the Lord. Six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and an ox for each one: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 
And the Lord spake to Mosheh, saying: 
Take (the waggons) from them, that they may be for the work of the service of the tabernacle of ordinance; and thou shalt give them to the Levites, to each man according to the need of his work. 
And Mosheh took the waggons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites. 
Two waggons and four oxen gave he to the sons of Gershon, according to the need of their work; 
And four waggons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to the need of their work, by the hand of Ithamar bar Aharon the priest. 
But to the sons of Kehath he gave not, because they had the work of the sanctuary, and carried upon their shoulders.
