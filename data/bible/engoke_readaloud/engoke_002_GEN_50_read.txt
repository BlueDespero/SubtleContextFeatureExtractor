Genesis.
Chapter 50.
And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept over him, and kissed him. 
And Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
And forty days were completed to him; for so are completed the days of the embalmed; and the Mizraee mourned for him seventy days. 
And the days of his mourning passed: and Joseph spake with the house of Pharoh, saying, If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray, before Pharoh, saying 
My father adjured me, saying, Behold, I die; in my sepulchre which I have prepared for me in the land of Kenaan, there shalt thou bury me. And now let me go up, I pray, and I will bury my father and return. 
And Pharoh said, Go up and bury thy father, as he adjured thee. 
And Joseph went up to bury his father; and all the servants of Pharoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Mizraim, 
Went up with him; and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and the house of his father: only the children, and the flocks, and the cattle, they left in the land of Goshen. 
And with him went up, also, chariots and horsemen; and there was a very great host. 
And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jardena, and lamented there with lamentations great and very strong. And he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
And the inhabitants of the land of Kenaan saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and said, This is a mighty mourning of the Mizraee; therefore its name is called Abel Mizraim; which is beyond Jardena. 
And his sons did as he had commanded them. 
And his sons carried him into the land of Kenaan, and buried him in the cavern of the Double Field, which Abraham bought for an inheritancesepulchre of Ephron the Hitaah, before Mamre. 
And Joseph returned into Mizraim, he and his brethren, and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 
And the brethren of Joseph saw that their father was dead; and they said, Perhaps Joseph will retain enmity against us, and requiting will requite us all the evil which we did him. 
And they made visitation to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before his death, saying, 
Thus shall you speak to Joseph, I pray you to forgive the guilt of thy brethren and their sin wherewith they did evil against thee. And now forgive, I beseech thee, the guilt of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake with him. 
And his brethren came and fell before him, and said, Behold, we are thy servants. 
And Joseph said to them, Fear not, for I fear the Lord. 
When you thought evil against me, before the Lord it was intended for good, to be done, as at this day, for the preservation of much people. 
And now do not fear; I will sustain you and your children. And he consoled them, and spake consolation to their heart. 
And Joseph dwelt in Mizraim, he and his father’s house. And Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
And Joseph saw of Ephraim three sons; also the sons of Makir, the son of Menashe, were born, whom Joseph brought up. 
And Joseph said to his brethren, I die; but the Lord remembering will remember you, and bring you up from, this land to the land of which He sware to Abraham, to Izhak, and to Jakob. 
And Joseph adjured the sons of Israel, saying, The Lord remembering will remember you, and you shall carry my bones up from hence. 
And Joseph died, the son of a hundred and ten years, and they embalmed him, and laid him in an ark in Mizraim.
