BOOK FIRST— AN UPRIGHI*"®^ 

I 

M. MYRIEL 

In 1815, M. Charles Frangois-Bienveiiu Myriel was Bishop of 
D . He was a man of seventy-five, and had occupied the bishopric 

of D since 1806. Although it in no mann.er concerns, even in the 

remotest degree, what we have to relate, it may not be useless, were 
it only for the sake of exactness in all things, to notice here the re- 
ports and gossip which had aricen on his account from the time of 
his arrival in the diocese. 

Be it true or false, what is said about men often has as much in- 
fluence upon their lives, and especially upon their destinies, as what 
they do. 

M. Myriel was the son of a counsellor of the Parlement of Aix; 
of the rank given to the legal profession. His father, intending him 
to inherit his place, had contracted a marriage for him at the early 
age of eighteen or twenty, according to a widespread custom among 
parliamentary families. Charles l^Iyriel, notwithstanding this mar - 
riage, had, it was said, been an object of much attention. His person 
was admirably moulded ; although of slight figure, he was elegant 
and graceful ; all the earlier part of his life had been devoted to the 
world and to its pleasures. The revolution came, events crowded 
upon each other ; the parliamentary families, decimated, hunted, and 
pursued, were soon dispersed. M. Charles Myriel, on the first out- 
break of the revolution, emigrated to Italy. His wife died there of 
a lung complaint with which she had been long threatened. They h"' 
no children. What followed in the fate of M. Myriel? The de''"’- 
the old French society, the fall of his own family, the tragic 
of ’93, still more fearful, perhaps, to the exiles who behelo 
from afar, magnified by fright — did these arouse in him i 
renunciation and of solitude? Was he, in the midst of 
reveries or emotions which then consumed his life, — ^ - 
by one of those mysterious and terrible blows wh- 
whelm, by smiting to the heart, the man wh 
not shake, by aiming at life or for*'”"® ^ 'M'n 
all that was known was that wh( 
priest.

ness permitted gleams of the angel within. She was more a spirit 
than a virgin mortal. Her form was shadow-like, hardly enough body 
to convey the thought of sex — a little earth containing a spark- 
large eyes, always cast down ; a pretext for a soul to remain on earth, 

Madame Magloire was a little, white, fat, jf)lly, hustling old 
woman, always out of breath, caused first by her activity, ancl then 
by the astlima. 

M. Myriel, upon his arrival, was installed in his episcopal palace 
with the honours onlainwl by the imperial &lt;Iecn‘es, which class the 
bishoji ne.xt in rank to the field-marshal. 'Phe mayor and the presi- 
dent made him the first visit, anti he, on his part, paiti like honour 
to the general ami the prefect. 

'Phe installation being completed, the town was curious to see its 
bishop at work.

• M. MYRIKI. KKCOMK55 MONSEIGNEUR mEN'VKN’tt 

The bishop's [lalace at D- was contiguous to the hospital: the 

palace was a spacious and beautiful edilice, Imih of stone near the 
beginning of die last century by Monseignenr Henri Pujet, a doc- 
tfir of theology of the Faculty of J’aris, abhe of Siniore, who was 

hisliup of D in 1712. The* palace was in truth a lordly dwelling : 

there was an air of grandeur about everything, tlic afiartments of the 
bislioji, tile saloons, the chambers, the "court of honour, which was , 
very large, with arched w'alks after the antitjue b’lorcnline style ; and 
a garden planted with magniPicent trees. 

In the dining hull was a long, super!) gtdlery, which was level with 
the ground, opening upon the garden; Monseigiieur Henri Pujet 
ha»I given a grand bampiet on the 2*hh of July, 1714, to Monseigneur 
diaries Hrviiart de (lenlis, archbishop, Prince d'Embrun, Antoine 
&lt;le Mesgrigny, capnehin, bishop of flra-sse, Fhiiimie de Vendome, 
graml-fjrior de France, the Abhd de Saint Honore de Larins, Fran- 
&lt;;ois de llertfin de Clrillon, lord bishop of Vence, Cesar de Sabran de 
Forcalquier, lord bishop of Glandeve, and Jean Soanen, priest of the 
oratory, preacher in orflinary to the king, lord l)isho[) of Senea ; the 
ptirtra’its of tiiese seven reverend i»ersonage.s ilecorated the hall, and 
this memorable date, July 2')th, 1714, appeared in letters of gold on 
a white marble talilet. 

The hospital was a low, narrow, one story building with a atnaS 
garden. 

Three days after the bishop’s advent he visited the hospital ; when 
the vjsit was ended, he invitM the director to oblige bin by coming 
to the palace^ 

"Monsieur," he said to tie director ol the hartal,

had and those who had not, knocked at the bishop’s door ; some came 
to receive alms and others to bestow them, and in less than a year he 
had become the treasurer of all the benevolent, and the dispenser to 
ail the needy, l^arge sums juissed through his bauds ; nevertheless he 
changed in no wise his mode of life, nor added the least lu.Kury to 
his simple fare. 

On the contrary, as there is always more misery among the lower 
classes than there is humanity in the higher, everything was given 
away, so to speak, before it was received, like water thirsty .soil ; 
it was well that Jiioney came to him, for he nevtJf kept any ; and lie- 
sides he robbed hinuself. It being the custom that all bishops .sliould 
put their baptismal names at the liead of their t)r&lt;lers and pastoral 
letters, the poor people of tlie tlistrict had chosen by a sort of af- 
fectionate instinct, from among the names of the bishop, that which 
was e.s;pressive to them, and lliey always called him Monseigneur 
Hienvenu. We shall follow their e.sajnple and sital! c:ill him thus; 
besides, this please&lt;l him. “I like this name," sjiki he; "Bienvemi 
countech;ilances Monseignenr.” 

We &lt;lo luU claim th:il tlie portrait which we present here is a true 
one ; we say {&gt;niy that it resenthles him.

'rtiR bishop, after converting his carriage into alms, none the less 
regularly made his round of visits, and in the tlimese of D — --^Ihis 
was a wa-arisome task. There was very little plain, a good deal of 
mountain : and hardly any roatls, :is a tnatler of ctmrse ; thirly-two 
curacies, forty-one vicarages, and two liumlred and eighty-five sub- 
curacies. T&lt;j Visit all llwse is a great labour, but the hislujp went 
througli with it. He travelled on foot in iiis own ncigliltourhood, in 
a cart wlten he wn'i-s in the plains, and in a atrtdti, a basket .strapped 
on tlie !«»rk of a inule, when in tlie mountains. 'Hie two women usu-

them he went alone. 

( Jne flay he arrivefl at Sene/., formerly the seat of a bishopric, 
mounted on an ass, His purse was very empty at the time, and would 
not permit any better conveyance. '1 he mayor tif the city came to 
rticeive him at the gate of the episcfipal residence, and saw him &lt;lis- 
mount from his ass with astonisiiment and mortification. Several of 
the citizen.s .stood near by, laughing. “Monsieur Mayor," said the 
bishop, “and Messieurs citizens, I sec what a-stonishes you ; you thitdt 
it shows a gtwd deal of pride for ajpor priest to use the same 
«mve3mnce which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done it from 
necessity, I assure you, and not from muiity."

WORKS ANSWERING WORDS 
His conversation was affable and pleasant, lie adapted himself to 
the capacity of the two old women wliu lived with him, hnt when 
he laughed, it was the laugh of a school-boy. 

Madame Magloire usually called him Your Greatness. One day 
he rose from his arm-chair, and went to his library for a book. It 
was U}K&gt;n one ttf the upper shelves, and as the bishop was rather 
short, he couUI not reach it, “Madame Magloire,” said he, “bring me 
a chair. My greatness does not e.'ctend to lhi.s shelf.” 

One of his distant relati\a‘s, the tiountess of I ,o, rarely let an oc- 
casion esettpe of emunc'rating in his presence what she called “the 
e-Npectiilions" of la-r three ■sons. She laid several rekitives, very old 
and near their death, of whtim her .sons were the legal heirs. The 
yiiungest of the three w.as to receive from a gre;it-aunt a hundred 
thousand livres in the funds ; the second was to lake the title of &lt;lnk6 
from Ins uncle : the ehlest wouU! suctavd to the peerage of his grand- 
father, I'he bishop commonly listened in silence to these innocent 
and panlon.'dile maternal displays. Once, Imwever, he appeared more 
dreamy than was Ids custom, while iMtulame de Lo rehearsed the &lt;Ie- 
tail of all these successions and all these “expectations.” Stopping 
suddenly, with some iinjuitience, she exclaimed, “My goodness, 
cousin, what are yon thinking alKHit?” “i am thinking,” .said the 
hishoji, “of a strange thing which is, I believe,_in St. Augustine: 
'IMace your expectations on him to wiiom there is no succession !’ ” 

On aixrther occasion, %vhen he received a letter announcing the 
decease of a gentleman of the country, in winch were detailed, at 
great length, not only the digtnlies of tlie departed, hut the feudal 
ami titular liomnirs of all his relatives, he exclaimed ; “What a hroad 
hack ItJis tlealhl What a womlniiis load of titles will he tdieerfuHy 
carry, and what hardihood must men have who will thus use the 
toml) to feed tlieir vanity !” 

At times he made ttse of gentle raillery, which was almost always 
charged with .serious ideas. Otice, tluring Lent, a young vicar came 

to D , and preached in the cathetlral. 'Hie subject of his sermon 

wa.H chanty, and he treated it very eknpiently. He called upon the 
rich to give alms to the poor, if they would escajje the tortures of 
hell, which he pictured in the most fearful colours, and enter that 
patadise which he painted as so desirable and inviting. There was a 
retired merchant of wealth in the audience, a little given to usury, 
M. Giborand, who had accumnlated an estate of two millions in the 
manufacture of coarse cloths and serges. Never, in the whole coum 
of hia life, had M. Giborand given alms to the unfortunate; hut 
from the date of this sermon it was noticed that he gave r^ularly, 
every Sunday, a peniqr to the old beggar women at the door of tih*

cuinstances. He wcmlil say, “Let us see the way in which the fault 
came to pass." 

as he smilinj'ly dc-scribed himself, an ('x-sinner, he had 
nonet of the inaccessibility of a ri^orist, and IntUlly professed, even 
under the frowning eyes of the fercjciuusly virtutnis, a doctrine 
which may be stated nearly as follows : — 

“Man has a body which is at once his burden and his temptation. 
He drags it along, and yields to it. 

“He ought tt&gt; watch over it, to keep it in Itounds; to repress it, 
and only to t&gt;bey it at tlte last e.stremity. It may i)e wrong to obey 
even then, hnl if so, the fault is veniitl. It is a fall, l&gt;ut a fall npon the 
knees, which may end in prayer. 

"'I'o lie a .saint is the exception; to be upright is the rule. Err, 
falter, sin, lint be tijjright. 

“‘I'o commit the least possible sin is the law for man. 'I'o live with- 
out sill is tile ilream of an :uigel. Everything ter rc.st rial is subject to 
sill. Sin is a gravitation." 

W hen he !H‘;trd many exchiniiiig, ami expressing great indigna- 
tion against tuiytliiiig, "Oh! oh!" he would say, smiling. “It would 
seem thtit this is a great crinio, of which they are all guilty. How 
frightened hy|«icrisy hastens to defend itself, and to get under 
cover." 

He w:is indulgent towards women, and towards the piw, upon 
whom the weigiit of society falls most heavily; and said: “The 
faults of women, ehildreti, and servants, of the feeble, the indigent 
and the ignorant, tire the f.iults of their hushands, fathers, and 
masters, of the strong, the rich, and the wise." At other times, he 
said, “'I'eaeli the ignorant as much as you can; .society is culpable 
in not providing instruction for all, ami it must answer Jor the 
tiiglit which it pnidiiee.s. If the .soul is left in darkness, sins will 
be cunimitled. 'I'he guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he 
who cause.s the darkness." 

As we see, he had a strange and peculiar Way of judging things. 
I 8u.s}&gt;ect that he nctiuircd it from the (io.sjH?l. 

In company one clay he heard an account of a criminal case that 
was alanit to be trietl. A miserahle man, through love for a woman 
and for the cliild she had borne him, ha&lt;l lieen making false coin, 
ins means luring exhausted. At that time counterfeiting was still 
ptini.shed with tleath. 'fhe woman was arrested for passing the first 
piece that he had made. She wa.s held a prisoner, but there was no 
proof a(^inst her lover. She alone could testify against htQi,jBnd 
convict him by her confession. She denied his guilt 'They huusted, 
but she was obstinate in her denial In this state of the case, tiw

trusted in God, The bishop embraced him, and at the moment when 
the axe was about to fall, he said to him, “whom man kills, him God 
restoreth to life ; wliom his bretliern put away, he findeth the Father 
Pray, believe, enter into life! 'J'he Imther is there.” When he de- 
scemled from the scalTold, something in his look made the people 
fall back. It would be hard to say which was the most wonderful, 
his jxileness or his serenity. As he mitered the humble dwelling 
which be smilingly called liis palaa', he said to his sister, “I have 
been ofticiating ixmtifically.” 

As the most sublime things are often least comprebendeil, there 
were those in the city who said, in c&lt;immentiug upon the bishop’s 
conduct, that it was affectation, hut .such ideas were confmed to the 
upper classes, 'fhe people, wlio do not look for unworthy motives 
in holy works, .admired and were softened. 

As to the bishop, the sight of the guillotine wa.s a shock to him, 
from which it was long before he recovered. 

'riie .scalTohl, indeed, when it is jirejiared and set up, has the effect 
of a hallucination. We may he imliiTerent to the death penalty, and 
may not declare ourselves, yes or no, so long as we have ncit seen 
a guillotine with our own eyes, lint when we sec one, the shock is 
violent, aiul wt; are conipelleil to decide am! take part, for or against, 
.Some mlmire it, liktf Le Mai-stre; others e.xccrate it, like Beccaria. 
The guillotine is the concretion of the law ; it is called the Avenger; 
it &gt;.■» not neutral and does not permit yoti to remain neutral. He who 
sees it quakes with t!u&gt; most mysterious of tremldings. All social 
questions set up tlieir jxiints of interrogation alxmt this axe. The 
senllold is vision. The .scaffold is not a mere frame, the scaffold is 
not a machine, the scaffold is not an inert piece of mechanism made 
t&gt;f wotul, of iron, and of rojies. It seems a sort of being which had 
.some sombre origin of which we can Iiave no idea ; one w»juld say 
that this fratne sees, lliat this machine uiKierstands, that this mecha- 
nism comprehends ; that this wotwi, this iron, and these roj».s, have 
a will. In the fearful reverie into which its presence east.s the soul, 
the awful apparition of the scaffold confounds itself with its horrid 
work. The scaffoki becomes the accontplice of the executioner; it 
devours, it eats flesh, and it drinks bkiofl. The scaffpld is a sort of 
monster created by the judge and the wtirknjan, a spectre which 
seems to live with a kind of unspc^able life, drawn from all the 
death which it ha.s wrought. 

Thus the impression was horrible ami deep; on the morrow of 
the execution, and for many days, the bishop appeared to be over* 
whetoed. The almost violent calmness of the fatal mcxnent had dis* 
apf&gt;eared ; the phantom of social justice took possession of him. He^ 
who ordinarily looked back upon all his actions wiffi a satisfaction 
so radiant, now seemed to be a subject of self-reproach. By times b« 
would talk to hiniself, mad in an undertone mutter dimi^ mona

What time these various affairs and his devotions and his breviary 
left him, he gave first to the needy, the sick, and the afflicted ; w^hat 
time the afflicted, the sick, and the needy left him, he gave to labour. 
Sometimes he used a spade in his garden, and sometimes he read and 
wrote, lie had but one name for these two kinds of labour ; he called 
them gardening. “The spirit is a garden,’' said he. 

Towards noon, when the weather was good, he would go out and 
walk in the lields, or in the city, often visiting the cottages and 
cabins. H e would be seen plodding along, wrapt in his thoughts, his 
eyes bent down, resting upon his long cane, wearing his violet 
doul)let, wadde&lt;l so as to be very warm, violet stockings and heavy 
shoes, and his flat hat, from the three corners of which hung the 
three gi)lden grains of spikenard. 

His etmurig ma&lt;le ti fete. One would have said that he dispersed 
warmtli atid light as he passed along. Old people and children would 
come to their doors for the bishop as they would for the sun. "He 
Idesscil, and was Idessed in return. Whoever was in need of any- 
thing was sliown the way to his house. 

Now and then he would sh^p and talk to the little boys and girls 
—and give a smile their mtnhers. When he had motiey his visits 
were to the poor ; when he had none, he visited tlie rich. 

As he made Ins cassock last a very long time, in order that it 
might not be perceived, he never went out into the city without 
his violet doublet. In summer this was rather irksome. 

On his rettirn he dined. His dinner was like his breakfast. 

At: !jalf“j«ist eight in the evening he took supper with his sister, 
Madanu* ]\lagloire standing behind them and waiting on the table. 
Nothing cotiid l&gt;e more frugal than this meal, 1 f , however, the bishop 
had &lt;me of Ins cures to supper, *\ladame Magloire improved the 
occasion iu serve her master with some excellent iisli from tlie lakes, 
or .some flue game from the mountain. liver^^ cure was a pretext 
for a line meal ; the bishop did not interfere. With these exceptions, 
there was rarely seen upon his table more than fioiled vegetables, 
i»r hrvml warmed with oil And so it came to be a saying in the city, 
the l)ishop dues not entertain a cure, he entertains a Trap- 

pist7* 

After su|ij&gt;er he would dial for lialf an lunir witli Mademoiselle 
Kaptistnie ant! Mailanie Maghnre, and llum go to his own rocun and 
write, .sometimes upon loose sheets, sometimes on the margin of one 
of his folios. He was a wdl-reail and even a learned man. He has 
left five iir six very curious manuscripts behind him; among them 
is a dissertation itpon this passage in Genesis ; In ihe bi^ff inning the 
spirii of God fuoved upon the face of the tmters. He contrasts this 
with three other versions ; the Arabic, which has : the winds of God 
blew; Flavius Josephus, who says: a mnd from on high fell apm 
Ml the earth; and flimlly the Chaldean i^aphrase of Qtdcelos, which

and cellar. 

'riiere wa.s also a stable in thc garden, which was formerly the 
liospital kilclieu, where the bishop now kept a couple of cows, and 
iuvarialdy, cv^tv luorning, he .sent half the milk they g.we to the sick 
at the hospital. “1 pay my tithes,” .said he. ^ 

1 1 is room wa.s cpiite large, ami was diflicult to warm in had weather. 

As wood is very dtsir at 1) , he conceived the idea of having a 

room partitiomxl cti’f from the cow-stable with a tight plank ceiling, 
In the coldest weather he pa.ssed hi.s evenings there, and called it hi-a 
tdiilcr parlour. 

In thi.s wintex ptirlour, as in the dining-room, the only furniture 
w;is a square wliite wooden table, and four straw chairs. The dining- 
room, however, was furnished with an &lt;dd .sideboard stained red, A 
similar sidelioard, .suitahly draped with white linen and imitation- 
lace. served for the altar which &lt;iecorated the oratorj”.

triluiUsi the nituiey f&lt;ir a heanlifnl new nlt.'u' for mon.seigneHr's ora- 
tory : he had ahvay.s ttiken tile money anti given it to the poor. “The 
most he.autiful ttf altars.” .stiid he, "is the .stud of an unliappy man 
who is ctunfortetl ami thanks (loti." 

In ids oratory he hat! two prie-dieu straw chairs, and an arm- 
chair, also tif sir.aw, in the bedrotmi. When he liappened to have seven 
tir eight vi.sitors at once, the prefect, or the general, or the major of 
the regiment in the garristm, t»r some of the pupils of the little semi- 
ntiry, he wtis obligetl to go to the .sttthle for the chtdrs that were in the 
winter parlom , tu the oratory for the jirie-tlieu, anti to the liedroora 
htr the ann-ehair; in this way he could get together as many as 
eleven seats for his visit«&gt;rs. At each new visit a room was stripped.

concealed the endiarra.ssmeiit of the situation by sttimliiig before the 
‘tin- if it were winter, or by walking in the g.arden if it were snnimer. 

Tliere was another chair in the .stranger'.s alcove, hut it liad lost 
lialf its .straw, ami hsid hut three legs, so thttt it could be use*! only 
wlu'H standing again.st the wall. Mademoiselle IJaptistine had also, 
in her room, a very hirge wood 'r ea.sy-chair, that had once Iwen 
gilded amlcovered with flowered silk, hut as it had to be taken into 
her room through the window, the stairway being too narrow, it 
could not be counted among the movable furniture. 

It hatl Iwen the amhition of Mademoi.sclle Bapti.stine to be able to 
buy a parlour lounge, with cushions of Utrecht velvet, roses on a 
yellow ground, while the mahogany should he in the fqrm of swans* 
necks. But this would have co.st at least five hundred francs, and as 
she had been able to save only forty-two frncs and ten sous for the 
purpose in five years, she had finally given it up. But who ever 
does attain to his ideal ?

fore tlie beds straw matting was spread. In all respects the house was 
kept by the two women exquisitely neat from top to bottom. This 
was the only luxury that the bishop would permit. He would say, 
“That iakcx nothing from the poor:'" 

We must confess that he still retained of what he had formerly, 
six silver tlishes and a silver .soup ladle, which Madame Magloirc 
contemi)lated tjvery day with new joy as they shone on the coar.se, 
white, linen table-cloth. Aiul as we are drawing the portrait of the 

Bishop of D just as he was, we must add that he had said, more 

than &lt;mce, “It would be difficult for me t«.t give up eating from sil- 
ver.” 

With this silver ware shottld he counted two large, massive silver 
candlesticks wliich he inherited from a great-aunt. 'J'hese candle- 
sticks heltl two wax-candles, and their place was upon the bishop’s 
mantel. When he liad any one to ditmer, Madame Alagloire lighted 
the. two candles ami placed the two candlesticks upon tlie table. 

There was in the hishop's chamber, at the ht-ad of his bed, a small 
cuiiboard in which Madame Magloirc placed the six silver dishes 
and the great latlle every evening. But the key was never taken out of 
it. 

The gjuxlen, which was somewluit nuirred hy the unsightly struc- 
tures of which we have spoken, was laid out witlt four walks, cro.ss- 
ing at the drain-well in the centre. 'ITiere wii.s another walk round the 
garden, along the white wall which enclosed it. Tlie.se walk.s left four 
square plat.s which were liordered with l)ox. In three of them Ma- 
dame Magloirc cultivated v&lt;-geta!iles : in the fourth the hi.shop had 
planted ilowers, atid liere and there were a few fruit lree.s. Madame 
Alaglrnre once said to him with a kind of gentle reprtjach : “Mottseig- 
neur, you tire always anxious to make everything u-seful, Init yet 
here i.s a plat that is of no use. It w«HiId I&gt;e much Iselter to h;ivc .salads 
there than bouquets.” “Madame Magloirc," replied the bishop, “you 
are mistaken, i’hc !a«‘autifttl is as useful as the u.seful." He added 
after a mtimeiu's silence, “iwrhaps more s«i." 

'I'lii.s pktl, consisting of three or four beds, ocettpied the bishop 
nearly as mueb a.s lies liooks. He us»,a11y pas.sed an hour or two there, 
trimming, weeding, and making holes here anil iliere in tlie ground, 
and planting seeds. He was as much averse to insects as a gardener 
would have wisheil. He made no pretentions to liotany, and knew 
nothing of gruup.s or classification; he did nut care in the least to 
decide between 'lonniefort and the natural method ; he took no {art, 
either for the utricle.s against the catylcdons, or for Jussieu against 
Linnseus. He did not study plants, he loved flowers. He had much 
respect for the learned, but still more for the ignorant ; and, while ht 
ftiinlied his duty in both these respects, he watered his ev^ 
summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.

matters it what threatens our heads or our purses ? Let us think only 
of what threatens our souls.’" 

Then turning to his sister : “My sister, a priest should never take 
any precaution against a neighbour. What his neighbour does, God 
pemiits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer to God when we think 
that danger hangs over us. Let us beseech him, not for ourselves, but 
that our brother may not fall into crime on our account.” 

, To sum up, events were rare in his life. We relate those we know 
of ; but usually he passed his life in always doing the same things at 
the same hours. A month of his year was like an hour of his day. 

As to what became of the “treasures” of the Cathedral of Embrttn, 
it would embarrass us to be questioned on that point. There w^ere 
among them very^ fine tilings, and very tempting, and very good to 
steal for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen they had already been 
^ by others. Half the work was done; it only remained to change the 
course of the theft, and to make it turn to the side of the poor. We 
can say nothing more on the subject. Except that, there was found 
among the bisho])'s papers a rather obscure note, which is possibly 
connected with this affair, that reads as follows: quesHon is,

AFTER DINNER PHILOSOPHY 

The senator heretofore referred to was an intelligent man, who 
had made his way in life with a directness of purpose which paid no 
attention to all those stunilding-blocks which constitute obvStacles in 
men’s patli, known as conscience, sworn faith, justice, and duty; 
he had advanced straight to his object without once swerving in the 
line of his advancement an&lt;i his interest. He had been iormeriy a 
procureur, mollified by success, and was not a bad man at all, doing 
all the little kindnesses that he could to his .sons, sons-iu’-law, and reL 
atives generally, and even to his friends ; having prudently taken 
the pleasant side of life, and availed himself of all the henefils which 
were thrown in his way. F. very thing else appeare&lt;l to him very stupid. 
He was sprightly, anil just enough of a scholar to tliink himself a 
disciple of Epicurms, while possibly he was only a product of Pigault- 
Lebrun. He laughed readily and with gusto at infinite and eternal 
things, and at the “crotchets of the good bishop,” He laughed at 
them sometimes, with a patronising air, before M, Myriel himself, 
who listened * 

At some semi-official ceremony, Count ^ ^ * (this senator) and 
M, Myriel remained to dinner widt the prefect At dessert, the seila^ 
tor, a little elevated, though always dignified, exclaimed : ‘

“Parbleu, Monsieur Bishop; let us talk. It is difficult for a senator 
and a bishop to look each other in the eye without winking. are 
two augurs. I have a confession to make to you; I have inv philoso- 
phy.” 

“And you are right,” answered the bishop. “As one makes his 
philosophy, so he rests. You are on a purple bed. Monsieur .Senator. ’’ 

The senator, encouraged by this, proceeded : — 

“Let us be good fellows.” 

“Good devils, even,” said the bishop. 

“I assure you,”- resumed the senator, “that the Marquis d’.Argens, 
Pyrrho, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are not rascals. I have all iny 
philosophers in my library, gilt-edged.” 

“Like yourself. Monsieur le Comte,” interrupted the bishop. 

The senator went on : — - 


“I hate Diderot; he is an idealogist, a demagogue, and a revolu- 
tionist, at heart believing in God, and more bigoted than V'olt.aire, 
Voltaire mocked at Needham, and he was wrong; for Neeilham’s 
eels prove that God is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of 
flour supplied the fiat lux. Suppose the drop greater ;ind the spoon-

a miser to beggers. Renunciation, for what? .Self-sacrifice, to wlmt ?

other wolf. Let us dwell, then, with nature. We are at the siuimtil.

are to become angels, with blue wings to our shoulders. Tell me, 
now, isn’t it Tertullian who says that the blessed will go from one 
star to another ? Well, we shall be the grasshoppers of the skies. 
And then we shall see God. Tut tut tut. All these heavens are silly. 
God is a monstrous myth. I shouldn’t say that in the Moniteur, of 
course, but I whisper it among my friends. Inter pocula. To sacri-

not so stitpid as to be the dupe of the Infinite. I am nothing ; I call

Shall I, after my death? No. What am I? A little dust, aggregated 
by an organism. What have I to do on this earth ! I have the choice to 
suffer or to enjoy. Where will suffering lead me? To nothing. But I 
shall have suffei'ed. Where will enjoyment lead me ? To nothing. But 
I shall have enjoyed. My choice is made. I must eat or be eaten, and I 
choose to eat. It is better to be the tooth than the grass. Such is my 
philosophy. After whicli, as I tell you, there is the grave-digger — 
the pantheon for — ^but all fall into the great gulf — the end; 
finis; total liquidation. This is the vanishing point. Death is dead, 
believe me. I laugh at the idea that there is any one there that has 
anything to say to me. It is an invention of nurses: Bugaboo for 
children; Jehovah for men. No, our morrow is night. Beyond the 
tomb are only equal nothings. You have been Sardanapalus, or you 
have been Vincent de Paul — that amounts to the same nothing. That 
is the truth of it. Let us live, then, above all things ; use your per- 
sonality wlule you have it. In fact, I tell you, Monsieur Bishop, I 
have my philo.sophy, and I have my philosophers. I do not allow my- 
.self to be entangled with nonsense. But it is necessary there should 
be something for tho.se who are below us, the bare-foots, knife- 
grinders, and other wretches. Legends and chimeras are given them 
to .swallow, about the soul, immortality, paradise, and the stars. 
They munch that ; they spread it on their dry bread. He who has 
nothing besides, has the good God — that is the least good he can 
have. I make no objection to it, but I keep Monsieur Naigeon for 
niy.sc'lf. The good God is good for the people.” 

The bishop c]appe&lt;I his hands. 

"That is the itlca,” he exclaimed. "This materihlism is an excel- 
lent thing, and truly marvellous ; reject it who will. Ah ! when one 
has it, he is a dupe no more ; he does not stupidly allow himself to be 
exiled like Cato, or stoned like Stephen, or burnt alive Mke Joan of 
Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable ma- 
terialism have the happiness of feeling that they are irresponsible, 
and of thinking that they can devour everything in quietness— places, 
sinecures, honours, power rightly or wrongly acquired, h’-' 
recantations, useful treasons, savoury capitulations of cor

poor ; besides that they are very ugly, and I much prefer a round 
mahogany table, 

am always happy: my brother is so good : he gives all he has 
to the poor and sick. We are full of cares : the weather is very severe 
in the winter, and one must do something for those who lack* We 
at least are warmed and lighted, and you know those are great com- 
forts. 

‘‘My brother has his peculiarities; when he talks he says that a 
bishop ought to be thus. Just think of it that the door is never closed. 
Come in who will, he is at once my brother's guest ; he f earsv nothing, 
not even in the night ; he says that is his form of bravery. 

“He wishes me not to fear for him, nor that Madame Magloire 
should ; he exposes himself to every danger, and prefers that we 
should not even seem to be aware of it ; one must know how to un- 
derstand him. 

“He goes out in the rain, walks through the water, travels in. 
winter, he has no fear of darkness, or dangerous roads, or of those 
he may meet. 

“Last year he went all alone into a diwStrict infested with robbers. 
He would not take us. He was gone a fortnight, and when he came 
back, though we had thought him dead, nothing had happened to 
him, and he was quite well. He said : ‘See, how they have robbed me I* 
And he opened a trunk in which he had the jewels of the Embrutt 
Cathedral wliich the robbers had given him. 

“Upon that occasion, on the return, I could not keep from scold- 
ing him a little, taking care only to speak while the carriage made 
a noivse, so that no one could hear us. 

“At first I used to say to myself, he stops for no danger, he is 
incorrigible. But now I have become used to it. I make signs to 
Madame Magloire that she sliall not oppose him, and he runs what 
risks he chooses. I call away Madame Magloire ; I go to my room, 
pray for him, and fall asleep. I am calm, for I know very well that 
if any harm hapiiened to him, it would be my death ; I should go away 
to the good Father with my brother and my bislsop. Madame Mag- 
loire has had more difficulty in getting used to what she calls his 
imprudence. Now the thing is settled: we pray together; we are 
afraid together, and we go to sleep. Should Satan even come into the 
house, no one would interfere. After all, what is there to fear in 
this house ? There is always One with us who is the strongest : Satan 
may visit our house, but the good God inhabits it. 

“That is enough for me. My brother has no need now even to 
speak a word. I understand him without his speaking, and we com- 
mend oursdves to Providence*

watch over him. They entrusted him to God’s keeping. 

Besides, Baptistine said, as we have seen, that his death would 
be hers. Madame Magloire did not say so, but she knew it. 


X 

THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT 

A LITTLE while before the date of the letter quoted in the preced- 
ing pages, the bishop performed an act, which the whole town 
thought far more perilous than his excursion across the mountains 
infested by the bandits. 

In the country near D , there was a man who lived alone. 

This man, to state the startling fact without preface, had been a 
member of the National Convention. His name was G . 

The little circle of D spoke of the conventionist with a certain 

sort of horror. A conventionist, think of it ; that was in the time 
when folks thee-and-thoued one another, and said “citizen.” This 
man came very near being a monster ; he had not exactly voted for 
the execution of the king, but almost; he was half a regicide, and 
had been a terrible creature altogether. How was it, then, on the 
return of the legitimate princes, that they had not arraigned this man 
before the provost court ? He would not have been beheaded, per- 
haps, but even if clemency were necessary he might have been ban- 
ished for life; in fact, an example, etc. etc. Besides, he was an 
atheist, as all those people are. Babblings of geese against a vulture ! 

But was this G a vulture? Yes, if one should judge him by 

the savageness of his solitude. As he had not voted for the king’s 
execution, he was not included in the sentence of exile, and could 
remain in France. 

Pie lived about an hour’s vreilk from the town, far from any ham- 
let or road, in a secluded ravine of a very wild valley. It was said he 
had a sort of resting-place there, a hole, a den. He had no neighbours 
or even passers-by. Since he had lived there the path which led to 
the place had become overgrown, and people spoke of it as of the 
house of a hangman. 

From time to time, however, the bishop reflectingly g^ed upon 
the horizon at the spot where a clump of trees indicated the ravine 
of the aged conventionist, and he would say: "There lives a soul 
which is alone.” And in the depths of his thought he would add "I 
owe him a visit.” 

But this idea, we must confess, though it appeared natural at firsi^ 
yet, after a few moments' reflection, seemed strange, impracticable, 
and almost repulsive. For at heart he shared the general impression, 
and the conventionist inspired him, he knew not how, with that 



32 L E S M I S K R A B I- S 

sentiment which is the. fringe of hatred, and which tiu* \Vi &lt;r 1 “avr* 

sion” so well expresses. 

However, the shepherd should not recoil fn^in the d:sea cd : r-. 

Ah! but what a sheep! 

The good bishop was perplexed: soinetinies he wali.r.! ai d.;:;! 
•direction, but he returned. 

At last, one day the news was circulated in the tfnvn !h:a :-;i* ; 

herdsboy who served the conventionist (i in his h.,- ; 

come for a doctor; that the old wretch was dyin!.T. ihn !:c ua n- 
tionless, and could not live through the night. Hiank t iad a ;dr i 
many. 

The bishop took his cane, put on his overctuit, hecar,. r ^ a 
was badly worn, as we have said, and l)csi&lt;!(‘s the niglu wilt’ I ^ * i vj 
dently rising, and set out. 

^ The sun was setting; it had nearly touched the hriii*.‘n w': m :h » 
bishop reached the accursed spot. He felt a eevtain tiui* km.ia; 
the pulse as he drew near the den. He jumped uwr a din h, ^ ! 

a hedge, made his way through a brush fence, found iujusrtf: u: a 
dilapidated garden, and after a bold advance aerrevs t Ium ^prn n d, 

suddenly, behind some high brushwood, he di^eiivtaed t!;r u n / c.. 

• It was a low, poverty-stricken hut. small and ch an, 
vine nailed up in front. 

Before the door in an old chair on ndlrr^, tluof* a m:in w.;di 
white hair, looking with smiling gaxc upon tin: M’uitik: -** 00 . 

The young herdsboy stood near him, handing him a I v o ii!'., 

While the bishop was looking, the old iimn raised his \ i t . 

^Thank you,” he said, shall need nothing niioe ;’'‘ aid !:; « 
smile changed from the sun to rest upon the !&gt;ov. 

The bishop stepped forward. At the souihI m Ids trp, r!-** 
old man turned his head, and his face cxpnsM'd as ima h lan- : c.r 
as one can feel after a long life. ^ 

'This is theju'st time since I have lived here/’ s-airi he, 1 
have had a visitor. Who are you, nioiisknu'

Bienvenu-Myriel ? I have heard that luiiiiu^ liruar, Air V“n lu* 
whom the people call Monseigneur Bieuvcnii r** 

'T am.” 


The old man continued half-smiling. '‘Thi’n you are mv -i . 
Possibly," ‘ .1 

“Come in, monsieur.” 

The conventionist extended his hand to the !«.sh«i,, fnit lie ,11.1 u..,

“I shall be dead in three hours.” 

Then he continued : 

‘“I am something of a physician ; I know the steps by which death 
approaches ; yesterday my feet only were cold ; to-day the cold has 
crept to my knees, now it has reached the waist ; when it touches the 
heart, all will be over. The sunset is lovely, is it not ? I had myself 
wheeled out to get a final look at nature. You can speak to me ; that 
will not tire me. You do well to come to see a man who is dying. It is 
good that these moments should have witnesses. Every one has his 
fancy ; 1 should like to live until the dawn, but I know I have scarcely 
life for three hours. It will be night, but what matters it: to finish 
is a very simple thing. One does not need morning for tliat. Be it 
so : I shall die in the starlight.” 

The old man turned towards the herdsboy : 

“Little one, go to bed : thou didst watch the other night : thou art 
weary.” 

The child went into the hut. 

The old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as if speaking 
to himself : “While he is sleeping, 1 shall die : the two slumbers keep 
fit company.” 

The bishop was not as much affected as he might have been : it was 
not his idea of godly death; we must tell all for the little incon- 
sistencies of great souls should be mentioned ; he who had laughed 
so heartily at “Ilis Highness,” was still slightly shocked at not be- 
ing called’monseigneur, and was almo.st tempted to answer “citizen.” 
He felt a desire to use the brusque familiarity common enough with 
doctors and priests, hut which was not customary with him. 

This conventionist after all, this representative of the people, had 
been a power on the earth ; and jjerhaps for the first time in his life 
the bishop felt himself in a humour to be severe. The conventionist, 
however, treated him with a inode.st consideration and cordiality, in 
which perhaps might have been discerned that humility which is be- 
fitt ing to one so nearly dust unto dust. 

The bi.shop, on his part, although he generally kept himself free 
from curiosity, which to his idea was almost offensive, could not 
avoid examining the conventioni.st with an attention for which, 
as it had not its source in symimthy, his conscience would have 
condemned him as to any other man ; but a conventionist he looked 
upon as an outlaw, even to the law of charity. 

G , with his seIf-posse.ssed manner, erect figure, and vibrat- 

ing voice, was one of those noble octogenarians who are tlte marvdi 
of the physiologist. The revolution produced many of these mea 
equal to the epoch : one felt that here was a tested man. Though 
near death, he preserved all the appearance of health. His 
gknoes, his firm accent, and the muscular movements of his Aetfld- 
ers seemed almost sufficient to disconcert death. Azrael, the 



34 LES MISERABLES 

hometan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned l)ack, thinkin?^ 

he had mistaken the door, G appeared to be dying because lie 

wished to die. There was freedom in his agony; his legs only were 
paralysed; his feet were cold and dead, but his heatl lived in full 
power of life and light. At this solemn moment (.1--- • seenird 
like the king in the oriental tale, flesh above and niarblt* beluw, dlte 
bishop seated himself upon a stone near by. Tlie beginning tif their 
conversation was e:: abnipto: 

‘T congratulate you,” he said, in a tone of reprimand. “At ksast 
you did not vote for the execution of the king.” 

The conventionist did not seem to notice the l)itter einjihinds 
placed upon the words “at least.” The smiles vanished f rntn his fact*, 
and he replied : 

“Do not congratulate me too much, monsieur; 1 tliil vnti' fur the 
destruction of the tyrant.” 

And the tone of austerity confronted the tone of severity. 
“What do you mean ?” asked the bishop. 

^ “I mean that man has a tyrant, Ignorance. 1 voted f&lt;n- the abnli* 
tion of that tyrant. That tyrant has liegotten latvaltv, which is au- 
thority springing from the False, while science is authi»rity spring- 
ing from the True. Man should lie governed i)v scienct*.”' 

“And conscience,” added the liisho]). • 

“The same thing: conscience is innate knowltnlgr ihai we have.” 
Monsieur Bienvenu listened with some amazement to this l;m* 
guage, novel as it was to him. 

The conventionist went on: 

^ “As to Louis XVL: I said no. I do not believe that 1 liavi^ the 
right to kill a man, but I feel it a dutv to exterminate evil I vou^r! 
for the downfall of the tyrant; that is to sav% for tfu aholinon nf

the old world, a vase of misery, reversecl, fieconies an nni of jtiv

the Ii'rench revolution is the greatest step in advance taken by man- 
kind since the advent of Clirist ; incomplete it may be, but it is sub- 
lime. It loosened all the secret bonds of society, it softened all hearts, 
it calmed, appeased, enlightened ; it made the waves of civilisation 
to flow over tlic earth; it was good. The French revolution is the 
consecration of humanity.” 

The bishop could not help murmuring : “Yes, ’93 !” 

The convenlionist raised himself in his chair with a solemnity 
well nigh mournftil, and as well as a dyhig person could exclaim, he 
exclaimed : 

“Ah ! you are there ! ’93 ! I was expecting that. A cloud had been 
forming for liftecn hundred years; at the end of fifteen centuries 
it burst. You condemn the thunderbolt.” 

Without pcrhai'S acknowledging it to himself, the bi.shop felt 
that he had been touched; however, he made the liest of it, and re- 
plied : 

“'I'he judge, speaks in the name of justice, the priest in the name of 
pity, which is only a more exalted justice. A thunderbolt should 
not lie mistaken.” 

.A.nd he added, looking fixedly at the conventionist ; “Louis 

xvn ?” 

The convcntionijft .stretched out his hand and seized the bishop’s 
arm. 

“I,ouis XVII. I.,et us see! For whom do you weep? — for the in- 
nocent child ? It is well ; wec]) with you. For the royal child ? I ask 
time to reflect. To my view the brother of Cartouche, ,an innocent 
child, hung by a rope under his arms in the Place de Greve till he 
died, for the sole crime of being the brother of Cartouche, is no less 
sad sight than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, mur- 
dered in the tower of the Temple for the sole crime of being the 
grandson oLLoui.s XV.” ^ 

"Monsieur," said the bishop, *T di.slike this coupling of names.” 

“C'artouche or I.ouis XV. ; for which are you concerned ?” 

There was a nuiinent of silence ; the ln.shop regretted almost that 
he had come, and yet he felt strangely and inexplicably moved. 

'I'he conventionist resumed; “C)h, Mon ieur Priesit! you do not 
love the harshness of the truth, but Christ loved it. lie took a 
.scourge and purged the temple ; his flashing whip was a rude speaker 
of truths; when he said ‘Sinitc parvulos,' he made no distinctions 
among the little ones. He was not pained at coupling the dauphin of 
Barabba.s with the daujjhin of Herod. Monsieu., innocence is its 
own crown ! Innocence lias only to act to be noble! She is as august 
in rags as in the fleur de lys.” , 

"That is true,” .said the bishojp, in a low tone. 

'T repeat," continued the old man ; “you have mentioned Louis 
XVII. Let us weep together for p 11 the innocent, for all the martyrs,

there a few steps behind the trees, how my good table and the moor- 
fowl that I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand livres of 
income, how my palace and my lackeys prove that pity is not a virtue, 
that kindness is not a duty, and that ’93 was not inexorable?” 

The old man passed his hand, across his forehead as if to dispel 
a cloud. 

‘'Before answering you,” said he, *T beg your pardon. I have 
done wrong, monsieur ; you are in my house, you are my guest. I owe 
you courtesy. You are discussing my ideas ; it is fitting that I con- 
fine myself to combating your reasoning. Your riches and your 
enjoyments are advantages that I have over you in the debate, but 
it is not in good taste to avail myself' of them. I promise you to use 
them no more.” 

'T thank you,” said the bishop. 

G went on : 

"Let us get back to the explanation that you asked of me. Where 
were we ? What were you saying to me ? that ’93 was inexorable ?” 

"Inexorable^ yes,” said the bishop. "What do you think of Marat 
clapping his hands at the guillotine ?” 

"What do you think of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the 
dragonnades ?” 

The answer was severe, but it reached its aim with the keenness 
of a dagger. The bishop was staggered, no reply presented itself ; but 
it shocked him to hear Bossuet spoken of in tliat manner. The best 
men have their fetishes, and sometimes they feel almost crushed at 
the little respect that logic shows them. 

The conventionist began to gasp ; the agonising asthma, which 
mingles with the latest breath, made his voice broken ; nevertheless, 
his soul yet appeared perfectly lucid in his eyes. He continued : 

"Let us have a few more words here and there — I would like it. 
Outside of the revolution which, taken as a whole, is an immense 
human affirmation, ’93, alas! is a reply. You think it inexorable, 
but the whole monarchy, monsieur? Carrier is a bandit; but what 
name &lt;Io you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a wretch; 
but wliat IS your opinion of Lamoignon Baville ? Maillard is fright- 
ful, but Saulx Tavannes, if you please? Le pere Duchene is fero^ 
cious, but what epithet will you furnish me for le pere Letellier? 
Jourdan-Coupe-Tete is a monster, but hss than the Marquis of Lou- 
vois. Monsieur, monsieur, I lament Marie Antoinette, archduchess , 
and queen, but I lament also that poor Huguenot woman who, in 
1685, under Ia)uis le Grand, monsieur, while nursing her child, was 
stripped to the waist and tied to a post, while her child was held 
before her ; her breast swelled with milk, and her heart with anguish ; 
the little one, weak and famished, seeing the breast, cried with 
agony; and the executioner said to the woman^ to the nursing 
mother, 'Recant t’ giving her the choice between the death of her

came still more from the dignity of his soul than from the ebb of 
his strength, ‘"I ha.ve passed my life in meditation, study, and con- 
templation. I was sixty years old when my country called me, and 
ordered me to take part in her affairs. I obeyed. There were abuses, 
I fought them ; there were tyrannies, I destroyed them ; there were 
rights and principles, I proclaimed and confessed them. The soil 
was invaded, I defended it ; France was threatened, I offered her 
my breast I was not rich; I am poor. I was -one of the masters of 
the state, the vaults of the bank were piled with specie, so that we 
had to strengthen the walls or they would have fallen under the 
weight of gold and of silver ; I dined in the Rue de TArbre-Sec at 
twenty-two sous for the meal. I succoured the oppressed, I solaced 
the suffering. True, I tore the drapery from the altar; but it was 
to staunch the wounds of the country. I have always supported the 
forward march of the human race towards the light, and I have 
sometimes resisted a progress which was without pity, I have, on 
occasion, protected my own adversaries, your friends. There is at 
Peteghem in Flanders, at the very place where the Merovingian 
kings had their summer palace, a monastery of Urbanists, the Ab- 
bey of Sainte Claire in Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793 ; I have done 
my duty according to my strength, and the good that I could. After 
which I was hunted, hounded, pursued, persecuted, slandered, 
railed at, spit upon, cursed, proscribed. For many years now, with 
my white hairs, I have perceived that many people believed they 
had a right to despise me ; to the poor, ignorant crowd I have the face 
of the damned, and I accept, hating no man myself, the isolation 
of hatred. Now I am eighty-six years old ; I am about to die. What 
have you come to a.sk of me?^’ 

^Tour benediction,'' said the bishop. And he fell upon his knees. 

When the bishop raised his head, the face of the old man had be- 
come august. He had expired. 

The bishop went home deeply absorbed in thought He spent the 
whole night in prayer. The next day, some persons, emboldened 
by curiosity, tried to talk with him of the conventionist G— ; he 
merely pointed to Pleaven. 

From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly 
love for the weak and the suffering. 

Every allusion to '^tliat old scoundrel G threw him into a 

strange reverie. No one could say that the passage of that soul 
before his own, and the reflex of that grand conscience upon his 
own had not had its effect upon his approach to perfection. 

This **pastoral visit” was of course an occasion for criticism by . ^ 
the little local coteries of the place. 

^*Was the bed-side of such a man as that the place for a bishop? 
Of course he could expect no conversion there^ AH these revolution- 
ists are backsliders. Then why go there? What haid ht been there to

We must say, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an in- 
telligent hatred. It implies a hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, 
among churchmen, beyond their rites and ceremonies, luxury is a 
crime. It seems to disclose habits which are not truly charitable. 
A wealthy priest is a contradiction. He ought to keep himself near 
the poor. But, who can be in contact continually, by night as 
well as day, with all distresses, all misfortunes, alli privations, 
without taking upon himself a little of that holy poverty, like the 
dust of a journey ? Can you imagine a man near a fire, who does 
not feel warm ? Can you imagine a labourer working constantly at 
a furnace, who has not a hair burned, nor a nail blackened, nor a 
drop of .sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face ? The first proof of 
charity jn a priest, and especially a bishop, is poverty. 

That is doubtlesss the view which the Bishop of D took of it. 

It must not be thought, however, that he took part in the delicate 
matters wliich would he called “the ideas of the age.” Pie had little 
to do with the theological quarrels of the moment, and kept his 
peace on quest ion.H where the church and the state were com- 
promised : jjut if he had lieen pressed, he would have been found 
rather Ultramontane than Gallican. As we are drawing a portrait, 
and can make no concealment, we are compelled to add that he 
wa.s very cooli towards Napoleon in the decline of his power. After 
181 .?, lie acquiesced in, or applauded all the hostile: manifestations. 
He refased to sec him as he passed on his return from the island 
of Ellia, and declined to order in his diocese public prayers for the 
emperor during the Hundred Days. 

Be.sides his sister, Mademoiselle Eaptistine, he had two brothers ; 
one, a general, the other, a prefwt. He wrote occasionally to both. 
He felt a coolness towtirds the first, because, being in a command 
in I’rovence., at the time of the landing at Cannes, the general placed 
himself at the head of twelve hundred men, and pursued the em- 
peror as if he wished to let him esicape, PI is correspondence was 
more affectionate with the other brother, the e.x-prefect, a brave 
and worthy man, who lived in retirement at Paris in the Rue Cas- 
sette. 

liven Monseigneur Bienvenu then had his hour of iiarty spirit, 
his hour of bitterness, his clouds. The shadow of the pas.sions of 
the moment jitissed over this great and gentle spirit in its occupation 
with eternal tilings. Certainly, such a man de.served to escape 
'political opinions. Let no one misunderslaiul our idea; we do not 
confound what are called “political opinions” with that grand aspira- 
tion after progress, with that sublime patriotic, democratic, and hu- 
man faith, which, in our days, shtiuld be the very foundation of all 
generous intelligence.^ Without entering into qu^tions which have 
only an indirect bearing upon the subject of this book, we simply 
say : it Would have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been

not be compelled to bear his cross. In his devotion lie had himself i"e- 
moved the imperial effigy from the cross that Napoleon had given 
him ; it left a hole, and he would put nothing in its place. ^'Better die/^ 
said he, ^^than wear the three toads over my heart/' He was always 
railing loudly at Louis XVIII. *‘Old gouty-foot with his English 
spatterdashes r he would say, ^^let him go to Prussia zvith his goafs-

he most detested, Prussia and England. He said so much that he 
lost his place. There he was without bread, and in the street with his 
wife and children. The bishop sent for him, scolded him a little, 
and made him doorkeeper in the cathedral. 

Ill nine years, by dint of holy works and gentle manners, Mon- 
seigneur Bienvenu had filled the City of D with a kind of 

tender and filial veneration. Even his conduct towards Napoleon 
had been accepted and pardoned in silence by the people, a good, 
weak flock, who adored their emperor, but who loved their bishop,

SOIJTUDE OF MOlVSEIGNEUR BIENVENU 

There h almost always a squad of young abbes about a bishop aa 
there is a flock *of young officers about a general. They are what 
the charming St. Francis de Sales somewhere calls ‘Vhite-billed 
priests.'* Every profession has its aspirants who make up the cor- 
t%e of those wlio are at the summit. No power is without its wor- 
shippers, no fortune without its court. The seekers of the future 
revolve about the .splendid present. Every capital, like every general, 
has its stafl:. Every bishop of influence has his patrol of under^ 
graduates, cherubs who go the rounds and keep order in the episco^ 
pal palace, and who mount guard over monseigneur's smile. To 
please a bishop is a foot in the .stirrup for a sub-deacon. One must 
make his own way ; the apostolate never disdain.s the canonicate. 
And as there arc elsewhere rich coronets so there are in the church 
rich mitres, "Jliere are bishops who stand well at court, rich, well 
endowed, adroit, accepted of the world, knowing how to pray, 
doubtless, but ktiowing also how to ask favours ; making themselves 
without scruple the viaduct of advancement for a whole diocese; 
bonds of union l)ctween the sacristy and diplomacy; rather abbes 
than priests, prelates rather than bishops. Lucky are they who can 
get near them. Men of influence as they are, they rain about them, 
upon their families and favourites, and upon all of these young 
men who please them, fat parishes, livings, archdeaconates, almon- 
ries, and cathedral functions — steps towards episcopal dignities. In 
advancing themselves they advance their satellites ; it is a whole solar 
system in motion* The ra;^ of their glory empurple their suite. Their

instead of le;itber for the army of the Sambre-et-Kleuse, four hun-

WUAT HI! IIKI-IKVED 

Wb need not examine the Bishop of D — from an orthodox point 
of view. Before such a soul, we fed only in the humour of respect. 
The conscience of an tipright man should be taken for granted. 
Monsiver, given certain natures, and we admit the possible de- 
velopment of all the beauties of human virtues in a faith dififerent 
from our own. 

What he thought of this dogma or that my.stery, are secrets of 
the interior faith known only in the tomb where souls enter stripped 
of all externals. But we are sure that religious difficulties never re- 
sulted with him in hypocrisy. No corruption is possible with the 
diamond. He believed as much as he could. Credo in Patrem, he 
often exclaimed ; and, besides, he derived from his good deeds that 
measure of satisfaction which meets the demands of conscience, 
and which says in a low voice, “thou art with God.” 

We think it our duty to notice that, outside of and, so to say, be- 
yond his faith, the bishop had an excess of love. It is on that account, 
quia mullum amavit, that he was deemed vulnerable by “serious 
men,” “sober persons,” and “reasonable people favounte phrases 
ki our sad world, where ^otism receives its key-note from pimantry.

he might not become more so ; he had a I'mu step, mid w,,% bn* bu!r

conclu.sion.— Gregory XVI.. at eighty years, was rreci and wnlme 
which did not prevent him from lieing a Iwd bishop. Mi.n*riyi»rnr 
Bienvenu had what people call “a fine hc.ad,'‘ but so brnevolrm tliiii 
you forgot tlmt it was fine. 

When he talked with that infantile gaiety tliat wai one of hi» 
graces, and of which we fiave already spoken, all felt at ea.* in bit 
presence, and from his whole iwrson joy seemni m radiate. Hit 
ruddy and fresh complexion, and his white teeth, all of whkh we rt

'well preserved, and which he showed when he laughed, gave him 
that open and easy air which makes us say of a man : he is a good 
fellow ; and of an old man : he is a good man. This was, we remem- 
ber, the eilect he produced on Napoleon. At the first view, and to one 
who saw him for the first time, he was nothing more than a good 
man. But if one spent a few hours with him, and saw him in a 
thoughtful mood, little by little the goodman became transfigured, 
and became inefl-ably imposing; his large and serious foi'ehcad, ren- 
dered noble by his white hair, became noble also by meditation; 
majesty was developed from this goodness, yet the radiance of gpod- 
neSvS remained ; and one felt something of the emotion that he would 
experience in seeing a smiling angel slowly spread his wings with- 
out ceasing to smile. Respect, unutterable respect, penetrated you 
by degrees, and made its way to your heart ; and you felt that you 
had before you one of those strong, tided, and indulgent souls, where 
the thought is so great that it cannot be other than gentle. 

As we have seen, prayer, celebration of the religious offices, alms, 
consoling the afflicted, the cultivation of a little piece of ground, 
fraternity, frugality, scl f-.sacrifice, confidence, study, and work, 
filled up eaclt clay of his life. Fillecl up is exactly the word ; and in 
fact, the Bishop's was full to the brim with good thoughts, good 
wcjrds, and gcMxl actions. Nevertheless it was not complete if cold 
or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in the eve- 
ning, wlien tlic two women had retired, in his garden before going 
to sleep. It seemed as if it were a sort of rite with him, to prepare 
himself for sleep liy meditating in presence of the great spectacle of 
the starry firmament. Sometimes at a late hour of the night, if the 
two women were awake, they would hear him slowly promenading 
the walks. He was there alone with himself, collected, tranquil, 
adoring, coni|)aring the serenity of hi.s heart with the serenity of 
the skies, moved in the darkness by the visible splendours of the 
consteIlali&lt;ms, and the invisible splendour of God, opening his soul to 
tlie thoughts whicli fall from the Unknown. In such momentvS, 
offering up his heart at the hour when the flowers of night inhak 
their perfume, liglited like a lamp in the centre of the starry night, 
expanding his soul in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance 
of creation, he could not himself perhaps have told what was pass- 
ing in his own mind ; he felt something depart from him, and some- 
thing descend upon him; mysterious interchanges of the depths of 
the soul with the depths of the universe. 

He contcmplatecl the grandeur, and the presence of God; the 
eternity of tlie future, strange mysterj^ ; the eternity of the past, mys- 
tery yet more strange ; all the infinities deep-hidden in every direc- 
tion about him ; and, without essaying to comprehend the incompre- 
hensible, he saw it. He did not study God ; he was dazzled by the 
thought He reflected upon these magnificent unions of atoms.

Their worship is questioning. This is direct religion, full of 
anxiety and of responsibility for him who would scale its walls. 

Human thought has no^ limit. At its risk and peril, it analyses and 
dissects its own fascination. We could almost say that, by a sort 
of splendid reaction, it fascinates nature; the mysterious world 
which surrounds us returns what it receives ; it is probable that the 
contemplators are contemplated. However that may be, there are 
men on the earth — if they are nothing more — who distinctly per- 
ceive the heights of the absolute in the horizon of their contempla- 
tion, and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. 
Monseigneur Bienvenu was not one of those men; Monseigneur 
Bienvenu was not a genius. He would have dreaded those sublimities 
from which some very great men even, like Swedenborg and Pas- 
cal, have glided into insanity. Certainly, these tremendous reveries 
have their moral use ; and by these arduous routes there is an ap- 
proach to ideal perfection. But for his part, he took the straight road, 
which is short — the Gospel. 

He did not attempt to make his robe assume the folds of Elijah's 
mantle ; he cast no x'ay of the future upon the dark scroll of events ; 
he sought not to condense into a flame the glimmer of things ; he had 
nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician. His humble soul 
loved ; that was all. 

That he raised his prayer to a superhuman aspiration, is probable ; 
but one can no more pray too much than love too much ; and, if it 
was a heresy to pray beyond the written form, St. Theresa and St, 
Jerome were heretics. 

He inclined towards the distressed and the repentant. The uni- 
verse appeared to him like a vast disease ; he perceived fever every- 
where, he auscultated suffeidng everywhere, and, without essaying 
to solve the enigma, he endeavoured to staunch the wound. The for- 
midable spectacle of ci’eated things developed a tenderness in him ; 
he was always busy in finding for himself, and inspiring others with, 
the best way of sympathising and solacing ; the whole world was to 
this good and rax-e priest a permanent subject of sadness seekixag to 
be consoled. 

There are men who labour for the extraction of gold ; he woid&lt;ed 
for tlxe extraction of pity. The misery of the universe was his mine. 
Grief everywhere was only an occasion for good always. Love one 
another; he declared that to be complete ; he desired nothing nioie, 
and it was his whole doctrine. One day, this man, who counted him- 
self philosopher/' this senator before mentioned, said to the 
bishop : ^'See now, what the world shows ; each fighting against all 
others ; the strongest man is the best man. Your love one another is 
a stupidity/' 'Well/' replied Monseigneur Bienvenu, without dis- 
cussion, "if it be a stupidity, the soul ought to shut itself up^ in it, like 
the pearl in the oyster/' And he shut himself up in it, he lived in it.

BOOK SECOND— THE FALL 
I 


THE NIGHT OF A DAY’S TRAMP 

An hour before sunset, on the evening of a day in the beginning of 
October, 1815, a man travelling afoot entered the little town of 

D . '"J'he few persons who at this time were at their windows or 

their doors, regarded this traveller with a sort of distrust. It would 
have been hard to fmd a passer-by more wretched in appearance. He 
was a man of middle height, stout and hardy, in the strength of 
maturity ; he might have been forty-six or seven. A slouched leather 
cap hali hid his face, bronzed by the sun and wind, and dripping 
with sweat. His shaggy breast was seen through the coarse yellow 
shirt which at the neck was fastened by a small silver anchor ; he 
wore a cravat twisted like a rope; coarse blue trousers, worn and 
shabby, white on one knee, and with holes in the other ; an old ragged 
grey blouse, patched on one side with a piece of green cloth sewed 
with twine: U]5on his back was a well-filled knapsack, strongly 
buckled and quite new. In his hand he carried an enormous knotted 
stick : his stockingless feet were in hobnailed shoes ; his hair was 
cropped and his beard long. 

The. sweat, the heat, his long walk, and the dust, added an inde- 
scriliable meanness to his tattered appearance. 

His hair was shorn, but bristly, for it had begin, to grow a little, 
and seemingly had not been cut for some time. Nobody knew him; 
he was evkiently a traveller. Whence had he come? From the south 

— pcrlinps from the sea ; for he was making his entrance into D 

by the same road by which, seven montlis before, the Emperor Na- 
poleon went from C'annes to Paris. This man must have walked all 
day long ; for he appeared very weary. Some women of the old city 
wliich is at the lower part of the town, had seen liim stop under the 
trees of the boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which is 
at the end of the promenade, l ie must have been very thirsty, for 
.some cliildrcn who followed him, saw him stf'p not two hundred 
steps further on and drink again at the fountain in the market-place. 

When he reached the corner of the Rue Poichevert he turned to 
the left and went towards the mayor’s office. He went in, and a quar- 
ter of an hour afterwards he came out. 

The man raised his cap humbly and saluted a gendarme who was 
seated near the door, upon the stone bench which^^BSB*®t«M^

sat down on a low stool liy the fire. D la-ing in the mountains, 

the evenings of October are cold there. 

However, as the host passed backwards and forwards, he kept 
a careful eye on tlie travt^ller. 

“Is dinner almost ready?” said the man. 

“Hirectly," ,sai&lt;l mine host. 

While the new-comer was warming himself with his hack turned, 
the worthy innkeeper, Jacquin i.aliarre, took a pencil from hi.s 
pockid, and then tore off the corner of an old jiaper which he 
pulled from a little table near the window. On the margin he 
wrote a line or two, folded it, tmd handed the scrap of paper to a 
child, who appeared t«&gt; serve him a.s laoiney and scullion at the 
same lime. 'I he innkeeper whispered a \vor&lt;i to the hoy and he ran 
oiT in the direction of the mayor's ortice. 

The traveller saw nothing of this. 

fie asked a second time: “Is dinner ready?” 

‘‘Yes : i«i a few moments,” .said the host. 

The boy came back with the paper. The host unfolded it hurriedly, 
as one who is e.speciing an answ'er. He seemed to retttl with attention, 
then throwing his hea«l on one .skle, thought for a nionient. Then he 
took a steji towards tlie traveller, vvlio seemetl drowneil in troublous 
thouglit, 

“Monsieur." said he, “I cannot receive you.” 

Tile traveller half rose from his seat. 

"Why ? .'\re you afraid I sliall not pay you, or do you want me to 
pay in advance ? I have money, I Idl you." 

“It is not that.” 

“What then?” 

“^'ou have money — ” 

“Ye.s," .said tlie man. 

“,\nd 1," .said the host ; “I Iiave no rcKim." 

“\VeII, put me in the stable,” quietly repliwl the man, 

“I cannot." 

“Wliy?” 

“Hecaust! tlie horses take all the room." 

“Well," respomled the man, “.’i conier in the garret; a tnws of 
straw: we will sec aliout that after dinner.” 

“1 cannot give you any iliimer." 

Thi.s declaration, made in a niea.surcd but firm tune, ajqxuired 
serious to the traveller. He got up. 

"Ah, bah ! but I aiu dying with hunger. I Iwve walked since sun- 
rise; I have travelled twelve leagues. 1 will pay, and I want some- 
thing to cat." 

“I have nothing," said the hosti 

The man burst into a laugh, and turned towards tlie jire-place and 
the ranges.

It was a tavern in the Rue OiafTsMt, 



FANTINE 55 

The traveller stopped a moment and looked in at the little window 
upon the low hall of the tavern, lighted by a small lamp upon a 
table, and a great fire in the chimney-place. Some men were drink- 
ing and the host was warming himself ; an iron-pot hung over the 
fire seething in the blaze. 

Two doors lead into this tavern, which is also a sort of eating- 
house — one from the street, the other from a small court full of rub- 
bish. 

The traveller did not dare to enter by the street door ; he slipped 
into the court, stopped again, then timidly raised the latch, and 
pushed open the door, 

‘‘Who is it said the host. 

*'One who wants supper and a bed.'' 

^^‘\,11 right : here you can sup and sleep." 

He went in, all the men who were drinking turned towards him ; 
the lamp shining on one side of his face, the firelight on the other, 
they examined him for sonic time as he was taking off his knapsack. 

The host said to him : ^‘There is the fire; the supp’Sr is cooking in 
the [lot ; come and warm yourself, comrade." 

He seated himself near the fireplace and stretched his feet out 
towards the fire, half dead with fatigue: an inviting odour came 
from the pot. All that could be seen of his face under his slouched 
cap assumed a vague appearance of comfort, which tempered the 
sorrowful as[&gt;ect given him by long-continued suffering. 

His profile wa.s strong, energetic, and sad; a physiognomy 
strangely niarketl: at first it appeared humble, l)ut it soon became 
severe, llis eye shone beneath his eyebrows like a fire beneath a 
tfiicket. 

However, one of the men at the table was a fisherman who had 
put up his horse at the stable of I.abarre*s inn before entering the 
tavern of the Rue de Chaifaut. It so happened that he had met, 
diat same morning, this suspicious-looking stranger travelling be- 
tween Bras d'Asse and^ — I forget the place, I think it is Escoublon* 
Now, on meeting him, the man, who seemed already very much 
fatigued, had asked him to take him on behind, to which the fisher- 
man responded only by doubling his pace. The fisherman, half an 
hour before, had been one of the throng about Jacquin Labarre, 
and had himself related his unpleasant meeting with him to the peo- 
ple of the Croix d$ Coibas. He beckoned to the tavern-keeper to 
come to him, which he did. They exchanged a few words in a low 
voice ; the traveller had again relapsed into thought* 

The tavern-keeper returned to the fire, and laying his hand 
roughly on his shoulder, said harshly : 

**you are going to clear out from here !" 

The stranger turned round and said mildly^

iontainiiig a hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all 
sorts of things which the girdle held up. He turned his head ; his 
shirt, wide and open, showed his hull-like throat, white and naked ; 
he had thick bi-ows, enormous black whiskers, and prominent eyes ; 
the lower part of the face was covered, and had withal that air of 
being at home which is quite indescribable. 

“Monsieur,” said the ti'aveller, “I beg your pardon ; for pay can 
you give me a plate of soup and a corner of the shed in your garden 
to sleep in ? Tell me ; can you, for pay ?” 

“Who are you ?” demanded the master of the house. 

The man replied : “I have come from Puy-Moisson ; I have walked 
all day ; I have come twelve leagues. Can you, if I pay?” 

“I wouldn’t refuse to lodge any proper person who would pay,” 
said the peasant ; “hut why do you not go to the inn ?” 

“irherc is no room.” 

“Bah ! That is not possil;)lc. It is neither a fair nor a market-day. 
Have you been to I^barre’s house ?” 

"Yes.” 

“Well ?” 

The traveller replied hesitatingly : “I don’t know ; he didn’t take 
me.” 

“Have you been to that place in the Rue Chaffaut?” 

The embarrassment of the stranger increased; he stammered: 
“They didn’t take me either,” 

The pea.sant’s face assumed an expression of distrust : he looked 
over the new-comer from head to foot, and suddenly exclaimed, 
with a sort of shudder : “Are you the man !” 

He looked again at the stranger, .stepped back, put the lamp on 
the table, and took down his gun. 

His wife, on liearing the words, “ore you the min,” started up, 
and, clasping licr two children, precipitately took refuge behind her 
husband ; she looked at the stranger with alTriglit, her neck hare, 
her eyes dtlale&lt;I, munnuring in a low tone: “Tso maraude!” ‘ 

All this happened in less time than it takes to read it ; after exam- 
ining the man for a moment, as one would a viper, the man advanced 
to the door and said : 

"Get out!” 

"For pity’s sake, a glass of water,” said the man. 

“A gun shot," said the peasant, and then he closed the door 
violently, and the man heard two heavy bolts drawn. A moment 
afterwards the window-shutters were shut, and noisily barred. 

Night came on aj^ce; the cold Alpine winds were blowing ; by 
the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the 
gardens which fronted tne street a kind of nut trfdch seemed to be 



58 LES MISER ABLES 

made of turf ; he boldly cleared a wooden fence and liiinscll 

in the garden. He neared the hut; its door was a narrow, hnv on- 
trance ; it resembled, in its construction, the shanties whicli the r&lt; nul' 
labourers putup for their temporary accommodation. Me, doubtless, 
thought that it wasj, in fact, the lodging* of a road-la Inni re r. I le was 
suffering both from cold and hunger. He liad resigned liinisdl it? 
the latter ; but there at least was a shelter from tlie cold, lliese Inits 
are not usually occupied at night He got down and crawled intr&gt; tlic 
hut. It was warm there and he found a good bed of straw. 1 It* rested 
a moment upon his bed motionless from fatigue : then, as lus knap- 
sack on his back troubled him, and it would make a good pillow, he 
began to unbuckle the straps. Just then he lieard a ferocious growl- 
ing and looking up saw the head of an enormous Imibdug at the 
opening of the hut. 

It was a dog-kennel ! 

He was himself vigorous and formidal)le; .seizing his stick, he 
made a shield of his knapsack, and got out of the hut: as hvA he 
could, but not without enlarging the rents of his already tat P*red gar- 
ments. 

He made his way also (Uit of the garden, hut hack wards ; f teiug 
obliged, out of respect to the dog, to have rec«nu*st» to that kind td" 
manoeuvre with his stick, wliich adepts in tliis sort of fencing i*a!l

When he had, not without difficulty, got over tlie feuc&lt;*, In* again 
found himself alone in the street without k;Higing, roof, or 
driven even from the straw-bed of that wretched tlog keime!. I !e 
threw himself rather than seated himself on a stone, and il appe:o‘S 
that some one who was pa.ssing heard him exclaim. *‘1 am iu4, even 
a dog !” 

Then he arose, and began to tramp a,t!^in, taking !u‘s wav out 
the town, hoi)ing to find some tree or haystack iiciieath wliidi Iv* 
could shelter himself. He walke&lt;l on for some time, hU !u-ad brtwe.I

the fi'cld nor upon the hill, but one ugly tree, a few steps from the 
traveller, which seemed to be twisting and contorting itself. 

This mair was evidently far from possessing those delicate per- 
ceptions of intelligence and feeling which produce a sensitiveness 
to the mysterious asj^ects of nature ; still, there was in the sky, in this 
hillock, plain, and tree, something so profoundly desolate, that af- 
ter a nuanent of motionless contemplation, he turned back hastily 
to the road. Tlicre arc moments when nature appears hostile.

which sustained sieges in the religious wars, was still surrounded, 
in ISIS, by old walls flanked by square, towers, since demolished. 
He passed through a breach and entered the town. 

It was about eight o’clock in the evening : as he did not know the 
streets, he walked at hazard. 

So he came to the piade'cture, then t(^ the seminary ; on passing 
by the Qitbedrtil sciuare, he shook his fist at the church. 

" At the corner of this square .stands a printing-office; there were 
first printed the proclamations of the emperor, and the Imperial 
Guard to the army, brought from the Island of Elba, and dictated by 
Napoleon I iim.self. 

Exhaustetl with fatigue, anti hojting for nothing better, he lay 
down on a .stone bench in frtmt t)f this printing-office. 

Just then an old woman came out of the church. She saw the 
man lying there in the tlark and said : 

“VVhat are volt doitig there, my frietul?” 

He replied fiarshly, and witli anger in his tone : 

“You see, my gooti wtnnati, 1 am going to .sleei&gt;.” 

The good woman, who really merited the name, was Madame la 
Marquise tie K — — , 

“I ’pon tite Itench?" said she. 

“i M tr nineteen years 1 have Itad a wooden mattress/' said the man ; 
“to-night I have a stone one." 

"Voti have been a .soldier?" 

“^'es, my good woman, a .soldier/' 

“Why don’t you go to the inn?” 

“Bec.'Uise ! littve no money." 

“Ala.s !" saitl Modantc tie R , “I have tinly four sous in my 

purse," 

“Give them tlten." The man took the four sous, and Madame de 
R ctmtinued : 

“You cannot find lotlging for so little in an inn. But have you 
trietl? You cannot pass the night so. You must be cold and hungry. 
They should give you lodging for charity.” 

“I have knocked at every door." 

"Well, wW then ?" 

“Everybody has driven me avmy."

jMaclemoiselie Baptistiiio, thin, fragile, a little taller than her 

brotljcr, wore a silk pnee colour dress, in the style f?f 1806 , which 
she had hought at that lime in I’aris, and which still lasted licr. To 
l.)orrow a common mode of expression, which has the merit of say* 
ing in a single wfird what a page wmdd hardly express, Madame 
Magloire had the air of a peasant, aiul Miideinoiselle I’ajrtistine that 
of a lady, Itladanu! Magloire wore ;i white funnel -shape*] cap : a gold 
jctimu'fli' at her neck, t lie only hit of feminine jewellery in the house, 
a snowy fiehn just pi'ering out above a black frieze dress, with witU; 
short sleeves, a gns-n and risl eheeket! calico n]»r&lt;m tied at tlu: waist 
with a green rihhon, with a stomacher of the same [linned np in 
front ; on Ikt feet, sh&lt;‘ wore coarse shoes and yellow stockings like 
the women of Marseilles, Madiunoiselle Ha|itisliiie’s dress was cut 
after tlie fashion «if IHOtv, short waist, narrow skirt, sleeves with 
epaulettes, and with tlaps and huttons. Tier grey hair was hid iiiuier 
a frizzetl front called ii M.’idame MagUtire hu&lt;i an intelli- 

gent, clever, and lively air; the two corners of her month unequally 
raised, and the upper lip jiniject ing heyoitd the under one, gave some- 
thing morosii and im])enous to her expression. So long as inonseig- 
neur was silent, she talked to him without reserve, an&lt;l wit It a mingled 
resiwH't and freetioin ; hut from the time that he ojiened hi.s mouth as 
we have seen, she itn[»licitly obeyetl like mademoiselle. Mademoi- 
selle Baptist ine, however. &lt;'li&lt;l not speak. .She citnfmecl herself to 
olieying, iind emleavoiiriiig to jilease. Bveii when she was young, 
shc'was not pretty ; she had large an«l very prominent bltte eyes, and 
a long pinched n«»se, hut her whole face anti person, as we ,saitl in the 
outset, breathed an inefi’able goodness, .Slie hatl been fore-ordained 
to jneekness, but faith, charily, httpe, these three virtues which gently 
warni the heart, had gradually subliinateil this rneektiess into s.inc- 
tity. Nature hat! matle her a liunb; religion h.ad niadc her an angel. 
Poor, sainted woman ! gentle, hut hist souvenir. 

Mademtdselle Baplisline has m often related what cveurred at 
the hishojj's house that evening, titat many persons are .still living 
who can recall the minutest detaihs. 

Just as the bishop entered, Madame Magloire was speaking with 
some wamilli. .She was talking to Mutli-moisi'llt' ujHm a familiar 
subject, and one to whieli tlie hislui[&gt; was tjuile accustomed. It waaf 
adiscHSsitw on the means tif fastening the front tUior. 

It .seems that while Mailame Magloire was out making provision 
for supiKT, she had heard the news in sundry places. There was talk 
that an Ill-favoured runaway, a suspicious vagabond, had arrived and 
was lurking somewhere in the town, and that some unpleasant ad- 
ventures nnght Itefall those who should come home lata that night; 
besides, that the police was very bad, as the prefect and the mayor 
did not like oi» another, and were hewing to injure each other by 
untoward events ; that it was the part of ifisa pet^ to be tiieir

THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE 

The door opened. 

It opened quickly, quite wide, as if pushed by some one boldly 
and with energy. 

A man entered. 

That man, we know already ; it was the traveller we have seen 
wandering about in search of a lodging. 

He came in, took one step, and paused, leaving the door open be- 
hind him. He had his knap.sack on his back, his stick in his hand, 
and a rough, hard, tii’ed, and fierce look in his eyes, as seen by the 
firelight, i l'e was hideous. It was an apparition of ill omen. 

Madame hlagloire had not even the strength to scream. She stood 
trembling with her mouth open. 

Mademoiselle Baptistine turned, .saw the man enter, and .started 
up half alarmed ; then, slowly turning back again towards the fire, 
she looked at her brother, and her face resumed its usual calmness 
and serenity. 

The bishop looked upon the man with a tranquil eye. ' 

As he was opening his mouth to .speak, doubtless to ask the 
stranger what he wanted, the man, leaning with both hands on his 
club, glanced from one to another in turn, and without waiting for 
the bishop to speak, said in a loud voice ; 

“See here I My name is Jean Valjcan. I am a convict ; I have been 
nineteen years in the galleys. I'’our days ago I was set free, and 
.«tarted for Pontarlier, which is my destination ; during those four 
days I have walked from Toulon. To-day I have walked twelve 
leagues. When I reached this place this 'ening I went to an inn, 
and they sent me away on account of my yellow passport, which I 
had shown at the mayor’s office, as was necessary. I went to another 
inn ; they said : ‘Get out !’ It was the same with one as with another; 
nobody would have me. I went to the prison, and the turnkey would 
not let me in. I crept into a dog-kennel, the dog bit me, and drove 
me away as if he had been a man ; you would have said that he knew 
who I was. I went into the fields to sleep beneath the stars : there 
were no stars ; I thought it would rain, and there was no good 
God to stop the drTOs, so I came back to the town to get the shelter 
of some doorway. There in the square I lay down upon a stone: a 
good woman showed me your house, and said: ‘Knock there!' 1 
have knocked. What is this place ? Are you rji inn ? I have money ; my 
savings, one hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous whifch I We 
earned in the gallws by my work for nineteen years. I will pay.

"Madsane MagIcrfre,’* said the bt«W&gt;

The man took three steps, and came near the 'lamp which stood 
on the table. “Stop,” he exclaimed ; as if he had not been undchstood, 
“not that, did you understand me ? I am a galley-slave — a convict- — - 
I am just from the galleys.” He drew from hi.s pocket a large sheet 
of yellow paper, which he unfolded. “There is my passport, yellow 
as you see. That is enough to have me kicked out wherever 1 go.^Will 
ydtt read it ? I know how to read, I do. I learned in the galleys. There 
is a school there for those who care for it. Sec, here is what tliey have 
put in the passport; ‘Jean Valjean, a liberated convict, native of 

you don’t care for that, ‘has been nineteen years in the galleys ; 

five years for burglary: fourteen years for having attempted four 
times to escape. This jnan is very dangerous.’ There you have it ! 
Everybody has thrust me out; will you receive me ? Is tliis an inn? 
Can you give me something to eat, and a place to sleep ? I lave ymi a 
stable?” 

“Madame Magloire,” said the bishop, “put some sheets on the 
bed in the alcove.” 

We have already described the kind of obedience yielded by these 
two women. 

' Madame Magloire went ont to fuHil her orders. 

The bishop turned to the man : 

“Monsieur, sit down and warm yourself : wc are going to take 
supper presently, and your bed will be made rea&lt;ly while you sup.” 

At last the man quite undenstood; hi.s face, the e.xpr’es.sion of 
which till then had been gloomy and hard, now e.xpressed stupe fa&lt;. 
tion, doubt, and joy, and became absoluudy womlerful, lie Iwgan to 
stutter like a madman. 

“True ? What ! You will keep me ? yt&gt;u won't drive me away ? a 
convict! You call me Monsieur ind "don’t .say ‘Het out, dog!’ ns 
everybody else does. I thought that you would" .send me away, so I 
told first off who I am. Oh ! the line woman who .sent me liere ! 1 
shall have a supper ! a bed like other people with mattress an&lt;l sheets 
— a bed ! It is nineteen years that I have not .slept &lt;»n a Ih-hI. S'on arc 
really willing that I .should stay? You are gocxl people! Besides I 
have money ; I will pay well. I beg your pardon, Monsieur Innkeeper, 
what is your name ? I will pay all you say. You are a fine man. You 
are an innkeeper, an’t you ?” 

"I am_a prie.st who lives here,” said the bishop. 

“A priest,” said the man. “Oh, noble pric.st ! Then you do not ask 
any money ? You are the cur4, an’t you ? the cure of tliis big church ? 
Yes, that’s it. How stupid I am ; I didn’t notice your cap.” 

While speaking, he had deposited his knapsack and stidc in the 
corner, replaced his passport in his pocket, and sat down. Made* 
moiselle Baptistine looked at him pleasantly. He continued; 

“You are humane. Monsieur Cure ; you don't despise me. A good 
priest is a good thing. Then you don’t waut me to pay you ?" 



F A N T I N E 65 

“No,” said the bishop, “keep your mone3^ How much have j-ou? 
You said a hundred and nine francs, I think.” 

“And fifteen sous,” added the man. 

“One hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous. And how long 
did it take you to earn that ?” 

“N inetecn years.” 

“Nineteen years !” 

The bishop sighed deeply. 

The man continued : “1 have all my money yet. In four days I 
have spent only twenty-five sous which I earned by unloading wa- 
gons at (irassc. As you are an alihe, I must tell you, we have an al- 
moner in the galleys. And then one day I .saw a bishop ; monseigneur, 
they called him. It was the Bishop of Majore from Marseilles. He 
is the cure who is over the cures. You sec — beg pardi^n, how 1 bungle 
saying it, but for me, it is so far off! you know what we are. He said 
mass in the centre of the pliice on an altar; he had a pointed gold 
thing on his head, that slione in the sun ; it was noon. We were drawn 
up in line on three sides, with cannons and matches lighted liefore 
us. Wc could not see iiiin well. He spoke to us, but lie was not near 
enough, we did not imdenstand him. 'J'hat is what a bishop is.” 

While he was talking, the bishop shut the door, which he had left 
wide open. 

Madame Magloire brought in a plate and set it on the table. 

“Maclaine Magloire," said the bishop, “put this plate as near the 
fire as j-ou can.” 'Mien turning toward, s his guest, he added: “The 
night wiinl is raw in the Alps ; j’ou must he cold, monsieur.” 

Every lime he said this word monsieur, with his gently .solemn, 
and heartily Iiospitublc voice, the man’s countenance lighted up. 
JfoH.f/i’iir to a convict, is a glass of water to a man dying of thirst 
at sea. Ignominy thirsts for respect. 

“The lamp,” said the bishop, “gives a very poor light.” 

M.'idanie Jilagloire understood him, and going to his bedchamber, 
took from the mantel the two silver candlesticks, lighted the candles, 
and placed them on the table. 

“Monsieur CunV’ said the man, “you are good ; you don’t despise 
me. You take tne into your house; yott light your candles for me, 
and 1 hav'ji’t hid from you where I come from, and how miserable 
I am.” 

The bishop, who wa.s sitting near him, touched hi.s hand gently 
and said ; “You need not tel! tne who you are. This is not my house; 
it is the house of Clirist. It does not ask any comer whether he has a 
name, but whether he has an affliction. You are suffering; you are 
hungry and thirsty ; be welcome. And do not thank me ; do not tell 
me that I take you into my house. This is the home of no man, except 
him who needs an asylum. I tell you, who are a traveller, that you are 



66 LESMIsfiRABLES 

more at home here than I ; whatever is here is yotirs. hat need 
have I to know your name? Besides, before you told me, I knew it/' 

The man opened his eyes in astonishment : 

^'Really ? You knew my name ?’' 

*'Yes,” answered the bishop, ‘'j^our name is my brollier/' 

‘‘Stop, stop, Monsieur Cure/^ exclaimed the man. “I was fam- 
ished when I came in, but you are so kind that now I don’t know 
what I am ; that is all gone/* 

The bishop looked at him again and said : 

“You have seen much suffering?" 

“Oh, the red blouse, the ball and chain, the plank to slee|&gt; on. the 
heat, the cold, the galley’s crew, the lash, the double eliaiu for noth- 
ing, the dungeon for a word, — even when sick in her!, the chain. 
The dogs, the dogs are happier ! nineteen years ! and 1 am forty-six, 
and now a yellow passport. That is all." 

“Yes," answered the bishop, “you have left a place of stifiVring 
But listen, there will be more joy in heaven over the tears of a rt*- 
pentant sinner, than over the white robes of a hundred goiKl imm. 
If you are leaving that sorrowful place with hate aitd aiiger against 
men, you are worthy of compassion; if you leave it willt gtHulwill, 
gentleness, and peace, you are better than any of us." 

Meantime Madame Magloire had vserv&lt;‘d up supper: it ctmsistei! 
of soup made of water, oil, bread, and salt, a little pmdv. a scrap of 
mutton, a few figs, a green cheese, and a large loaf of r^'e i»reaf h She 
had, without asking, added to the usual dinner of the bishop a ht»tt!e 
of fine old Mauves wine. 

The bishop’s countenance was lighted up with this expression of 
pleasure, peculiar to hospitable natures. “To supper!" lie said 
briskly, as was his habit when he had a guest. lie seated the man at 
his right. Mademoiselle Baptistinc, perfectly qtiiet and natural, took 
her place at his left 

The bishop said the blessing, and then serv(*d the soup liimstdf, 
according to his usual custom. The man fell to, eating grtaalil v. 

Suddenly the bishop said: “It seems to tm sometiiing is iackioF 
on the table." ^ 

The fact was, that Madame Magloire had set out only the three 
plates which were necessary. Now it was the custom of tlie hou^e, 
when the bishop had any one to supper, to set all six of the silvta* 
plates on the table, an innocent display. This graceful mwtiraniH^ of 
luxury was a sort of chikilikeness which wa.s full of charm in this 
gentle but austere household, which elevated {xwertv to ilvmitv 

Madame Magloire understood the remark; withmit a word she 
went out, and a moment afterwards the three plates for whicit tlte 
bishop had asked were shining on the cloth, .syntmetricallv arranml 
before each of the three guests, " ^

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER 

Now, in order to give an idea of what passed at this table, we cannot 
do better than to transcribe here a passage in a letter from Idade- 
moiselle Baptistine to Madame de Uoischevron, in which the con- 
versation between the convict and the bishop is related with charm- 
ing minuteness. 

• • • • 

1 his man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity 
of a starving man. After supper, however, he .said : 

“ ‘Monsieur Cure, all this is too goo&lt;l for me, but I must .say that 
the wagoners, who wouldn’t have me eat with them, live belter than 
you.’ 

“Between us, the remark .shocked me a little. My brother an- 
swered ; 

“ 'They are more fatigued than I am.’ 

“'No,’ re.sponded tliis man; ‘they have more, money. You are 
poor, I can see. Terhajis you are not a cure even. Are you only a 
cure ? Ah ! if Clod is just, you well ileserve to he a cure.' 

“ ‘God is more than just,’ said my brother. 

“A moment after he added ; 

“ ‘Monsieur Jean Valjcan, you arc going to Pontarlier ?’ 

“ 'A comi-Utlsory journey.’ 

“I am pretty sure that is the expression the man used. Then he 
continued : 

“ ‘I niust be on the roatl to-morrow morning at daybreak It is a 
hard journey. H the nights are cold, the days are warm.’ 

“ 'You are going.’ .said my brother, ‘to a fine country. During the 
revolution, wlim my family was ruined, 1 took refuge first in 
Franche-C’omfe, and .supported my.selC there for some time by the 
labour of my hands. I'here 1 found plenty of work, and had only to 
make my clioice. There are paper-mills, tanneries, di.stilleries, oil- 
factories, large clm*k-making e.staljli.sh!nent.s, steel manufactories, 

a er fotimiries, at least twenty iron foundries, four of which, at 
i, Chatillion, Audineourt, and Beure, are very large.* 

“I think I am not mistaken, and that these are the names that my 
brother mentioned. Then he broke off and addressed me : 

“ ‘Dear sister, have we not relatives in that part of the country?* 
“I answered: 

" 'We had ; among others Monsieur Lucenet, who was captain of 
the gates at Pontarlier under the old regime.’ 

" ‘ Y es,' replied my brother, 'but in *93, no one had relatives ; every 
one depended uixm his hands. I laboured. They have, in the region 
of Ponawlicr, vidiere you are going. Monsieur Val lean, a busineit

man has a suh cnng [loint, not to touch upon it at all ? It seems to me 
that this ^vas my l&gt;rotlier\s inmost thought At any rate, all I can say 
IS, it he had all tliese ideas, he did not show them even tome : he was 
from beginning to end, the same as on other evenings, and he took 
snppei with this Jean V^aljean with the same air and manner that 
he would hav'e supjicd with Monsieur Gedeon, the provost, or with 
the cure of the parish,

.Afthh having said good-night to his sister, ^ronseigneur Bienvenu 
took one of the silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other 
to his guest, and said to him ; 

‘‘Monsieur, 1 will show you to your room.” 

T he man followed him, 


As may have been understood from what ha.s Ijeen said before 
the house was so arranged that one could reach the alcove in the 
or.itory only by passing through the bishop’s sleeping chamber Tust 
as they were passing through this room Madame Magloire was put-

childhood he had not been taught to read : when he was grown up, 
he chose the occupation of a primer at Faverolles. His mother’s 
name was Jeanne Mathieu, his father’s Jean Valjean or Vlajean, 
probably a nickname, a contraction of VoiUi Jean. 

Jean Valjean was of a thoughtful disposition, but not sad, which 
is characteristic of affectionate natures. Upon the whole, however, 
there was something torpid and insignificant, in the appearance at 
least, of Jean Valjean. He had lust his parents when very young. 
His mother died of malin'actice in a milkfever : his father, a primer 
before him, was killed by a fall from a tree. Jean Valjean now had 
but one relative left, his sister, a widow with seven children, girls 
and boy.s. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and, as long as 
her husbatid lived, she had taken aire of her younger brother. Her 
husihand died, leaving the elde.st of these children eight, the young- 
est one year old. Jean Valjean had just reached his twenty-fifth 
year : he took the father’s place, and, in his turn, supported the sister 
who reared him. I’his he &lt;lid naturally, as a duty, and even with a 
sort of moroseness on his part. His youth was spent in rough and 
ill-rccompensetl labour : he never was known to have a sweetheart ; 
he had not time to lie in love. 

At night he came in weary and ate his soup without .saying a word. 
While he was eating, hi.s si.ster, Mi^re Jeanne, frequently took from 
Iiis porringer the best of his meal ; a bit of meat, a slice of pork, the 
heart of the cabbage, to give to one of her children. He went on eat- 
ing, hi.s head betit tlown nearly into the soup, his long hair falling 
over his dish, hiding his eyes, he did not seem to notice anything 
that wa.s done. At h'avernllcs, not far from the house of the Val- 
jeans, there was on the other side of the road a farmer’s wife named 
Marie Claiule ; the Valjean children, who were always fatnished, 
sometimes went in their mother’s name to borrow a pint of milk, 
which they would drink behind a hedge, or in some comer of the 
lane, snatching away the pitcher so greedily one from another, that 
tbe little girls would spill it upon their aprons and their necks p 
if their mother had known of this exploit she would have punished 
the delinquents severely. Jean Valjean, rough and grumbler as he 
was, paid Marie Claude ; their mother never knew it, and so the 
children escaj^d. 

He earned in the pruning season eighteen sous a day: after tlatlr 
he hired out as a reaper, workman, teamster, or labourer. He dkJ 
whatever he could find to do. His sister worked also, but wlmt could 
she do with seven little children ? It was a sad group, #hidh aaseiy 
was grpwiping and dosing upon, little by little. There ws* a very 
severe winter ; Jean had no work, the family had fersiad ; literally,, 
no bread, smd seven children. ~ 

One Sunday night, Maubert laabeiu, the bafcer esi the! Place de

even to his name. He was no longer Jean Valjean : he was NtUj*^6er 
24,601. What became of the sister ? What became of the seven chil- 
dren ? Who ti'oiibled himself alK)ut that ? What becomes of the haKi- 
ful of leaves of the young tree when it is sawn at the trunk? 

It is the old story. These poor little lives, these creatures of God, 
henceforth without su]:)])ort, or guide, or asylum ; they passed away 
wherever cliance led, who knows even? Each took a differetit path, 
it may be, and sank little by little into the chilling dark which en- 
gulfs solitary destinies ; lliat sullen gloom where arc lost so many 
ill-fated souls in the sombre advance of the human race. I'hey left 
that region ; the church of what had been their village forgot them; 
the stile of wliat Iiad I)een their ileld forgot them ; after a few years 
in the galleys, even Jean Valjean forgot them. In that heart, in 
which there had been a wound, there was a scar ; tliat was all. During 
the time he was at "J'ouloti, he heard but once of his sister ; that was, 
I think, at the end of the fourth year of his confmenuml. I &lt;lo not 
know how the news reached him : some r)ne who had known him at 
home liad vS&lt;‘en liis sister, Slie was in Paris, living in a poor stre.ei 
near Sumt Sulpice, the Rue du Geindre, She had with her Intt ong 
child, the yonngesi, a little boy. Where were the other six? She aid 
not kitow h(‘rself, peiiiaps, livery morning she went: to a bindery, 
No. 3 Rue du Sabot, wiiere she was employed as a folder and br&gt;ok- 
stitclier. She had to be there hy six in tlie inorning, long Itefore the 
dawn in the winter, hi the same Iniiklirig with tlie liindery, there was 
a school, where she sent her little boy, seven years old. As the school 
did not open until seven, and she must be at her work at six, her boy 
had to wait in the yard an hour, until the scIiim)! opened — an hour 
of cokl and darkness in t!u? winter. They would not let the childi 
wait in the bindery, liecause he was troublesome, they sai&lt;l. The 
warknieii, as tliey |&gt;asse&lt;I in the morning, saw the poor little fellow 
sometimes silting on the pavement nodding with weariness, and 
often sleejiing in the &lt;lark, criniched and bent over his basket When 
it rained, an old woman, the jiortress, took pity on him ; she let him 
come into Iter lodge, the furniture of whicli was only a pallet bed, 
a siiinning-wheel, two wooden chairs; and the little one slept 
there in a corner, hugging the cat to keep htinself warm* At seven 
o’clock the school opened and he went in. That is what was told 
Jean Valjean. It was as if a window hat! stuldenly been opened^ 
looking upon the tlestiny of ihttse he had loved, and then all was 
closed again, and he heard noiliing more for ever. Nothing more 
came to him; he had not seen tliem, never will he see them again! 
and through the reiminder of this sad history we shall not meet 
them again* 

Near the end of this fourth year, his chance of liberty came to 
Jean Valjean. His comrades helped him as they always do in that 
dreary place, and he escaped. He wandered two days in freedom

through the fields; if it is freedom to be lumUxl, to turn vinir h,’;;d 
each moment, to tremble at the least noise, to be afraui nt 
thing, of the smoke of a chimne}^ the passing of a man, (b«- ba\ in,:; 
of a dog, the gallop of a horse, the vStriking of a cluek, ni the dav

of die jDath, the bush, of sleep. .During the evening nj tin* .siH;(»ijd 
day he was retaken; he had neither eaten nor sic] a for thin\ .-ix 
hours. The maritime tribunal extended Ins sentence thrm* ymrs 
for this attempt, which made eight. .In tlie sixth yeai In's turti of 
cape came again; he tried it, but failed again. 1 !e did ntit ans\v«*r a; 
roll-call, and the alarm cannon was fired. .At niidu the iHMple m; du,* 
vicinity discovered him hidden beneatli the keel of .a un i!ir 

stocks; he resisted the galley guard which seirtMl him. M taon- 
resistance. This the provisions of the special cmle jninisbed !♦&gt; an 
addition of five years, two with the double chain, Ihirleen 3 ears. '1 iu* 
tenth year his turn came round again; lie made anr»ther aUrnjpi 
with no better success. Throe years for this new attempt. StMeen 
years. And finally, I think it was in the thirteenth yt'ar, he made 
yet another, and was retaken after an absence of only fom- Imm s. 
Three years for these four hours. Nineteen years. In OctMlua’, 1SI.\ 
he was set at large: he liad entered in 17^6 for having broken a 
pane of glass, and taken a loaf of bread. 

This is a place for a short parentliesis. This is the secmid time, 
in his studies on the penal question and on the senirnecs ni tiu’ !au\ 
that the author of this book has met with the theft of a loaf vd' 
bread as the starting-point of the ruin of u tlestitiy. ilaude t 
stole a loaf of bread; Jean Valjean stole a loaf oi l»read ; Ixtrglrsh 
statistics show that in London starvation is the immedian/^ cansr’ 
of four thefts out of five. 

Jean Val|ean entered the galleys Hohhing and shtidiln ing : 
went out hardened ; he enlere&lt;I in despair : he went ont sullen. 

What had been the life of this .s&lt;nil ?

FANXINE 

He constituted himself a tribunal. 

He began by arraifjning himself. 

He recognised, that he was not an innocent man, unjustly 
punished. He acknowledged that he had committed an extreme and 
a blamal:)le action ; that the loaf perhaps would not have been re- 
fused him, had he asked fur it ; that at all events it would have been 
better to w.ait, either for pity, (u‘ for work ; that it is not altogethei 
an unanswerable reply to say : “could I wait when I was hungry ?” 
that, in the first place, it is very rare that any one dies of actual 
hunger; and that, fortun.ately or unfortttnate’ly, man is so made 
that lie c:m suffer long and much, morally and physically, without 
dying; th:it he should, therefore, have had patience ; 'that tlmt 
would have been lietter even for those poor little ones ; th.at it was 
an act of folly in him, poor, worthless man, to seize society in all 
its strc**gth, forcilily by the collar, and imagine that ho could es- 
cape from misery by theft ; that that was, at all events, a had door 
for getting out of misery by which one entered into infamy; in 
short, that he had done wrong. 

Then he asKed himself : 

I f lie were the only one who had done wrong in the course of his 
fatal history ? 1 f , in the first place, it were nut a grievous thing that 
he, a workman, should have been in want of work; that he, an in- 
dustrious man, should have hacked bread. If, moreover, the fault 
having licen committed anti avowed, the punishment had not been 
savage an&lt;l c.xcessive. 1 f there were not a greater abuse, on the part 
of the law, in the penalty, than there h:ul been, on the part of the 
guilty, in the crime. If there were not an excess of weight in one of 
the .scales of the balance — on the side of the expiation. If the dis- 
charge of the penalty were not the eflfacement of the crime ; and if 
the result were not to rever.se the situation, to replace the wrong 
of the delinquent by the wrong of the repression, to make a victim 
of the guilty, and a creditor of the debtor, and actually to put the 
right on the side of him who had violated it. If that penalty, taken in 
connection with its successive extensions for his attempts to escape, 
had not at last come to be a sort of outrage of the stronger on the 
weaker, a crime of society towards the individual, u crime which 
was committed afresh every day, a crime which had endured fc^ 
nineteen years. 

He questioned himself if human society could have thiS t^jt 
alike to crush its members, in the one case by its unreasonaWe care- 
lessness, and in the other by its pitiless care ; and to a jodr nian 
for ever between a lack and an exc^, a lack of work, a« exMSS of

which his nioraf misery was ma«W up? Had this rude anti imleneretl

not afhrrn ; we do not, in fact, Iwlieve it. Jean Valjean was Um igno- 
rant, even after so mtich ill fortune, for nice discriminalion in these 
inaUers. At times he did not even know exactly wluil were hisi feel-

in the dark ; we might say that he liaiec! in Ins own sight. He lived 
constantly in the darknes:!, gt'^ipiiig Idindly and as in m dream. Only, 
at intervals, there broke over him suddenly, from within or from 
without, a shock of anger, an overflow of sufferirtf , a ouici: |ml!id

most iiie.sprcssihle.

would seem to be a phantom; all at once this phantom would give 
him a blow with a slick.

be almost true to say that for Jean Valjean there was no sun, no 
beautiful summer days, no radiant sky. no fresh April dawn. Seme

FANTINK 8l 

Spit Upon him; confused openings half swallow him; when he 
sinks he catches glimpses of yawning precipices full of darkness; 
fearful unknown vegetations seize uijtm him, hind his feet, and 
draw him to themselves; he feels that he is becoming the great 
deep ; he makes jiart of the foam ; liie billows toss him from one to 
tlie other; In* tastes the bitterness ; the greedy ocean is eager to de- 
vour him : the monster plays witli his agony. It seems as if all this 
were li(|uid hate. 

lie tries to (jefend himself; he tries to .sustain himself; he 
struj'g'les : he swinis. 1 fe— that poor strength that fails so .soon — he 
combats the unfailing. 

But yet lie struggles. 

Where now is the shij)? I'ar nwtiy yonder. Hardly visible in the 
pallit! gliiom of the horizon. 

'I'he wiuil lilovvs in gu.sts; the billows overwhelm him. He raises 
his eyes, but sees only the livid clouds. He, in his dying agony, 
makes ])art of tliis innneiise insanity of the .sea. He i.s' tortured to 
his death liy its immeasurable madness. He hears sounds, which 
are strange to man, sounds which seem to eonu* not from earth, but 
from some frightful realm beyond. 

'I'liere Jire birds in the clomls, c‘vi*n as there are angels above Hu- 
man distresses, Iiut what can tliey do for him? They fly, sing, 
float, while he is gasping. 

1 le feels tliat lie is buried at once by those two infinities, the opean 
and the .sky; the one is a tomb, the other a pall. 

Night descemis, he has been swimming for hours, his strength 
is almost c*xha«sted ; that ship, that far olT thing, where tliere were 
men, is gone; he is alone in the terrible gloom of the abyss; he 
sinks, he strains, he struggles, he feels beneath him the shadowy 
monslers of the unseen; he shouts. 

Men are no more. Where is God ? 

He shoHt.s. Help! Help! He shouts incessantly, 

Nothing in the norizon. Nothing in the sky. 

He inifiiores the blue vault, the waves, the rocks; all are deaf. 
He sunplicates the tempest ; the imperturable tcm|&gt;est obeys only 
the infinite. 

Around him are darkness, storm, solitude, wild and uncon- 
scious tumult, the ceaseless tumliling of the fierce waters; within 
him, horror and exhaustion. Beneath him the engulfing atwss. No 
resting place. He thinks of the shadowy adventures of nia lifo* 
leas body in the limitless gloom. The biting cold paralyses him. 
His hands clutch spasmodically, and grasp at nothing. Winds, 
clouds, whirlwinds, blasts, stars, all useless h What Stoll he do? 
He yields to despair; worn out,,he sedcs deatih; he no longd'. 
resists; be gives himself up; he abandons the contest, and he I 
rotted away into the dlamu depths of tbfc iSaym lor ever.

Sticiety, the state, in reducing his savings, had robbed him by

him by retail. 

I.iheration is not deliverance. A convict may leave the galleys

THE MAN AWAKES 

As the cathedral clock .struck tw&lt;i, Jean Valjean awoke. 

What awakenerl hini was, too govxl a bed. For nearly tv|||ty 
years las hful not slept in a bed, an&lt;!, although he hu&lt;! iu»t undrSRd, 
the sensation was too novel nett to distnrh his sleep. 

He luwi slept sttmething more than fotir hours. I lis fatigue had 
passetl away. He was n&lt;tt acct&gt;stoine&lt;l to give many hours to reixtsc. 

He opc'iied his eyes, and bujked for a nuiinent into the obscurity 
alxiut him, then he chised tliem to go to sleep again. 

When many diverse sensations have disturbed the day, when 
the mind is preoccupied, we can fall asleep once, hut not a second 
time. .Sleep comes at fir.st much more readily than it comes again. 
Such was tlie case with Jean Valjean. He could not get to sleep 
again, and .so he began to think. 

He w;us in one of tho.se iiuhxIs in wliieh the ulea.s we have in our 
tiiinds are perturbed. '1 here w.as a kind of vague ebb and flow in his 
brain. His oldest and his latest niemorie.s floated about |)ell mell, 
and crossed each other confusedly, losing their own shajies, swell- 
ing Iteyond measure, then disappearing all at once, as if in a muddy 
and troiihled stream. Many thoughts came to him, hut there was one 
which cfintimially presented itself, and which drove away all others. 
What that thought was. we shall tell directly. He had noticed the 
six silver plates and the large ladle that Madame Magloire had put 
on the table. 

I'liose six silver plates took possession of him. There thejr were, 
within a few steps. At the very moment that he passed through the 
middle room to reach the one he was now in, the old servant wa# 
placing them in a little cuplioard at jhc head of the bed. He had 
marked that cupboard well ; on the right, coming from the dsniBg'- 
roan. They were solid; and old silver. With the big ladle, they 
would brit^r at IcMt two hundrwl franca, double what he had got 
for nineteen year#’ labour. True ; he would have got more if the 
had not him. , 

Hia oUxid wavered a whole hoar, and a long o«i% ht fluctuadoa

lie had put into the corner of ihc alcoAH.‘, then he th. tist v»in hi- 
and placed his feet on the ground, and found hinisi^lf, he knew n* 
how, seated on his bed. 

He remained for some time lost in thoughl in that attitude. w!deli 
would have had a rather ominous look, IkuI any mw. seen Iran :h: re 
in the dusk — he only awake in the slinnlRTing house. Ml a! Mtiee lie 
stooped down, took off his shoes, and imt them sttflly n|»o!j the fum 
in front of the bed, then he resumed Ids thitikiug posture. ,u:d w;e 
still again. 

In that hideous meditation, the ideas which we Itave hetm liMim . 
ing out, troubled his brain witlmtit ceasing, entered, tlf n.u'u. k,, re- 
turned, and became a sort of weight ti]«tn him ; rmd tham lie t h* *0

sky, nature drowsing, the garden without a pulse, the quiet house, 
the hour, the moment, the silence, added something strangely sol- 
emn and unutterable to the venerable repose of tliis man, and en- 
veloped his white locks and hi.s closed eyes witli a serene and ma- 
jestic glory, this face where all was hope and conlklence — this old 
man’s head and infant’s slumber. 

There was something of divinity almost in this man, thus uncon- 
sciously august. 

Jean Valjean was hi the shadow w'ith the iron drill in his hand, 
erect, motionless, terrified, at this radiant figure. J-Ie had never seen 
anything comparahle to it. This confidence filled him with fear. The 
moral world has no greater .spectacle than this ; a l:ronl)!ed and rest- 
less conscience on the verge of committing an evil deed, contemj^t- 
ing the sleep of a good man. “ 

'i'his sleep in this solitinle, with a neighliour such as he, contained 
a touch of the stddime, which he felt vtiguely Itut powerfully. 

None could have told what was within him, not even lum.self. To 
attempt to re.alise it, the utmost violence must be imagined in the 
presence of the most extreme mildness. In hi.s face tiothing could be 
distinguished with certainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. 
He saw it ; that was all. Hut what were his thoughts; it would have 
been impossible to gue.ss. It wa.s clear that he was moved #ind 
agitated. But of what nature was this emotion ? 

He &lt;lid not remove his eyes fronx the old man. The only thing 
which was plain from liis attitude and his countenance was a strange 
indecision. You would have sai&lt;l he was hesitating between two 
retilms, that of the doomed ami that of tlie saved. He appeared ready 
either to cleave this skull, or to kiss this hand. 

In a few moment.s he raise&lt;l his left hand .slowly to hi.s forehead 
and took off his hat ; then, letting his hand fall with the same slow- 
ness. Jean Valjean resumed his contemplations, his cap itt his left 
hand, his club in his right, and his hair bristling on his fierce-lookhig 
head. 

Ihitler this frightful gatic the bishop still slept in profoundest 
peace. 

The crucifix above the mantelpiece was dimly risible in tlie moon- 
light, apjiarently extending its arms towards both, with a benedic- 
tion for one and a pardon for the other. 

Suddenly Jet^n Valjean put on his cap, then pssed quickly, with- 
out looking at the bishop, along the bed. straight to the cupboard 
which he jxerceived near its head ; he raised the drill to force the lock ; 
the key was in it ; he oiwned' it ; the first thing he saw was the basket 
of silver, he took it, crossed the room with hasty stride, careless of 
noise, reached the door, entered the oratory, took his stick, stepped 
out, put the silver in his knapsack, threw away the basket, ran 
across the garden, lej^psd over ihe waft like a tiger, and fled.

THElilSHOl’ AT \VUI!K 

The next day at sunrise, Monseigneiir ISicnvemi was wali.is!;; -r. ilu; 
garden. Madame Magloire ran Uiwards him i|nitf iH'.'.dr ' i ; -r ‘s. 

“Monseigneur, monscigneur,” cried she, “dues \Mi;r j:rr;L: 
know where the silver liasket is ?” 

"Yes,” said the bishop. 

“God be praised !” .said she, “I dirl not know wha! liad heci a u- . n' 
it.” 

The bishop had iust found tim iiasket on n (Inwcr-hi'd. ! ie r ■:

“Yes,” said .she, “hut there is rioihing in it. Tlu' j-i'vi r

“Good heavens! it is stolen. 'I'hat man whet c.itne l.i'.i niid.i -a.i’t-

And in the twinkling of an eye. with all the agilliv ,.f w'di li hrr

The bishop was .silent foranmment.then raisin}; iiia wi iMm.. . v.- ,

“Now fir-:!:, did this silver belong to us r" 

Madame Magloire did not answer; after a ni..mrri| p, p, ,,

there were yet here and there a few late lh:)wcrs in the hedges, the 
odour of whicli, as it nietUiini in his walk, recalled tlie memories of 
his childliood. 'Flurse ineniories were almost iiisupportalile, it was 
so long since they hud occtirred to him, 

IJnspcakalde thoughts thus gathered in his mind the wliole day. 
As the sun was sinking towanls the horizon, lengdiening the 
shadow on tlie ground of tlie smallest pehhle, Jean Valjean was 
seate&lt;l Ik hind a thicket in a large red&lt;Iish plain, an ahsolute desert 
Tlu‘.re was no hoinV.on Imt the /\i|)S, Not eveti tlu^ steeple of a village 
church, Jean \ aljean might Itave been thna* leagties from ] 

A hy-patii wliich crossi’&lt;l’the plain passed a few steps from the 
thicket. 

In the midst of this meditation, wliich would have heightened 
not a little the fright fill elTect of his rags to any one who might have 
met liim, lie heard a joyous sound. 

He tunuMl his head, and saw coming alt&gt;ng (lie path a little Savoy** 
ard, a ilo/en ytaars (dtl, singings with liis luirtlygurtly at his side, and 
his marmot hox on his hack. 

One of those pleasant and gay youngsters who go from place to 
place, with tlu‘ir kiu'i*s slicking through tlieir trousers. 

Always singing, the hoy stoi-iped from time to time, and played at 
tossing lip siiinc jiieces of money that he Iumi in his hand, probably 
his whole fortune. Atnmig them there was one forty-.snu.s piece?. 

Idle lioy stiiiqied hy the side of the tliicket wilhout seeing Jean 
Valjean, and tossed up his handful of sous; until this time he had 
skilfully caugln tlie whole of tln*m upon the hack of his hand. 

Tins lime the forty-sous piece escaperl Inm, an&lt;} rolled towards 
the thicket, near jeait \kdjean. 

Jean \‘alj&lt;‘an put his foot upon it. 

11u» hoy, hmvever, hml followecf tlie piece with his eye, and had 
.seen wliere it went, 

I !e was not frightened, and walked straiglit to the man. 

It was an entirely stditaiy place. Far as the evt? could reach there 
was no one on the plain or in the path, Xivthing could he liea rd. but 
the fain! erii»s of a Hock of of passage, that were Hying across 
the sky at an immense height. The child turnta! his back t«&gt; sun, 
which mafic Ids hair like tliremis of gold, and Hushed the savage face 
of Jean Valjean with a lurid glow. 

*VMonsieur,'* .said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidenoe 
which is made up of igtuirance riiSd innocence. *hny piece?** 

‘AVhat is yrnif name p said Jean Valjean,

**Get out/* said Jean Valjean.

Here we must again ask those questions, which we have already 
proposed elsewhere: was some confusetl sliuilow of all this formed 
in liis mind ? Certainly, misfortune, we have said, draws out the 
intelligence; it is doubtful, however, if Jean Valjcan was in a con- 
dition to discern all that we liere point out. 1 f these itle;is occurred 
to him, he hut caught a glimpse, he &lt;iid not sec ; and the only effect 
was to throw him into ; i uiexprcssihle auo tlistressing confusion. 
Being just out of that misshapen and gloomy thing which is called 
the galleys, the bishop had Jiurt his soul, a : a too vivid light would 
have hurt Jiis ejes (ni coming out of the tlark. The future life, the 
possilile life lh.'it was offer d to him thenceforth, all pure and radi- 
ant, lilletl him with tremhling and anxiety. Me no longer knew really 
wlien; lie was. I.ike an owl who should .see the sun sutkienly rise, 
the convict had Iteen da:o:led and blinded by virtue. 

One (biog wa.. certain, nor tlid he hiinself'&lt;iouh* it, l!i;it he was no 
longer the .s:iine man, that all wa.s changed iJi him. that it was no 
longer in his power to prevent the bishop from having talked to him 
and liaving otichcd him. 

in til’s I rnme of mind, he had met Petit (lervais, and stolen his 
forty sous. Whf* ? He could nut have e-xplained it, .surely ; was it the 
final elTect, the final effort of the evil tliought.s ho h,:d Iirought from 
the. galley.s, a remnant of impulse, a result of what is tailed in 
physics aer/Hi'm/ force? It was that, and it was also perhaps even 
le.s.s than that. We will .say plainly, it was not he who had stolen, it 
w'as not the man, it wa.s the beast which, from habit and instinct, 
had stupidly set its foot U|)on that money, tvliile the intellect was 
struggling in ilic midst of so many new and unknown influences. 
When the intellect awoke and saw this act of the lirute, Jean Val- 
je,an recoiled in anguish anti uttered a cry of liorror. 

It was a .strange phenomenon, poss'blc only in the condition m 
which he then was, but the fact is, that in stealiiig this money from 
.that d»ild, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable. 

However that may be, this mst misdeed had a decisive effect upon 
him ; it rushed acros.s the chaos of his intellect anti tlissipated it, 
set the light on one side and the dark clouds on the other, and acted 
upon his soul, in the condition it was in. a.s certain chemical re- 
agents act u|Kjn a turbltl mixture, by precipitating one element and 
producing a clear solution of the other. 

At finst. even before self-examination and reflection, distractedly, 
like one who seeks to escaiie, he endeavoured to find the boy to giv« 
him back his money ; then, when he found that that was useless 
and impossible, he stopped In desf^ir. At the very moment when be 
acclaimed t "What a wretch I am I" he saw himself as he was, and 
was already so far separated from hfanself that it SMned to hiaa 
(hat he was only a jphantom, and that he had theie before Mm, m 
flesh and boiMi, with his stide in Ms hand, Ms blouse on Ms bac3%

'rriii YKAU 1817 

Tnn year 1817 wus tliat which Louis XV'l If., with .a certain roy.a! 
assuiriatioii not devoid fif stateliness, styled the twenty-second year 
of his It was tlie 3 -cur vYheu M. Brugniere de .Sorsum wa-S 

.famous. All the hair-dressers’ .shops, hopinj' for the return of 
powder and birds of Paradise, were hedizened with azure and 
fleurs-de-lis. It was flie honest tinus wtien Count Lynch .sat every 
Sund:i 3 ' as churclnvartlen on the tiflicia! licnch at .Saint Germain des 
Pres, ill the tlre.ss of a peer of h’rance, with his red rihlKm anil long 
nose, and tliat inajestv of profdc peeuHar to a man who has done a 
brilliant deeil. The hrilliaul deed committed 1)3' AI. L 3 -nch was that* 
being mayor o^ISordeaux on the 12lh of Alarch, 1814, he had sur- 
rendered the eity a little too soon to the Duke of Angottlerne. Hence 
his peerage. In 1817 it was the fashion to swallow up little boys 
from four to .si-x t ears old in great morocco caps with cars, strongly 
rc.sembling the diininey-ixits of the ILsiiuimaux. The French army 
was dresseil in white after tlie Austrian .style ; regimcnt.s were called 
legions, and wore, instead of iiumiiers, the names of the depart- 
ments. Naf ioleon was at St Helena, and as luigland would not give 
him green cloth, liad luid his old coats turned. In 1817, Pellegrini 
sang: Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Polier reigned; Odry was 
not yet in esi.stence, Madame Saqui succeciled to Forioso. There 
were Prussians still in I'rance. M. Delalot was a personage. Ixsgiti- 
macy had Just asserted itself by cutting off the fist and then the 
head of Plcignier, Carbonneau, and Tolleron. Prince Talleyrand, 
the grand chamlKsrlain, and Abb^ I&lt;ouis, the designated minister of 
the finances, looked each other in the face, laughing like two au- 
gurs ; lioth iwd celebrated the mass of the l''ederation in the Champ- 
de-Mars on the Hthof July, 1790; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, 
Louis had served him as deacon. In 181/, in tlte cross-walks of this 
same Champ-de-Mars, were seen huge wooden cylinders painted 
blue, with traces of eagles and bees, that had lost their gilorag. ly^ 
ing in t!ie rain, and rotting in the grass. There were fat columns 
which, two years before, had supported the estrade of tht emperor 
in the Champ-de-Mai. They were blackened here and there from the 
bivouac-fires of the Austrians in barradoi near the Groa-Caillou, 
Two or three of these columns had disapfeaurfd in Hie fires of thtse

Clausel de Montals differed on sundry points from M. Clausel de 
Coussergues; M. de Salaberiy was not satisfied. Comedy- writer 
Picard, of the Academy to which comedy-writer Moliere could not 
belong, had Les deux Philiberts played at the Odeon, on the pedi- 
ment of which, the removal of the letters still permitted the inscrip- 
tion to be read distinctly: Theatre be lTmperatice. People took 
sides for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabyier was factious ; 
Bavoux was revolutionary. The bookseller Pelicier published an 
edition of Voltaire under the title, Works of Voltaire, of the French 
Academy. ''That will attract buyers,'' said the naive publisher. The 
general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson, would be the genius of 
the age; envy was beginning to nibble at him, a sign of glory, and 
the line was made on him — 


“Meme quand Loyson vole, on sent qu’il a despattes.'' 

Cardinal Fesch refusing to resign. Monsieur de Pins, Archbishop 
of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel of the 
Vallee des Dappes commenced between France and Switzerland by 
a memorial from Captain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Si- 
mon, unknown, was building up his sublime dream. There was a 
celebrated Fourier in the Academy of Sciences whom posterity has 
forgotten, and an obscure Fourier in some unknown garret whom 
the future will remember. Lord Byron was beginning to dawn ; a 
note to a poem of Millevoye introduced him to France as a certain 
Lord Baron. David d'Angers was endeavouring to knead marble. 
The Abbe Caron spoke with praise, in a small party of Seminarists 
in the cul-de-sac of the Feuillantines, of an unknown priest, Felicite 
Robert by name, who was afterwards Lamennais. A thing wlxich 
smoked and clacked on -the Seine, making the noise of a swimming 
dog, went and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from 
the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV. ; it was a piece of mechanism 
of no great value, a sort of toy, the day-dream of a visionary, a 
Utopia— a steamboat. The Parisians looked upon the useless thing, 
with indifference. Monsieur VauBlanc, wholesale reformer of the 
Institute by royal ordinance and distinguished author of several 
academicians, after having made them, could not make himself one.

earnest eiiorts to have potnine de tcrrc •pronounced parmcntierCf 
without success. Abbe Gregoirc, ex-bishop, e.K-meinber of the Na- 
tional^ Convention, and ex-senator, had passed to the condition of 
the “intamous Greguire,” in royalist polemics. The expression 
which we have just employed, “passed to the condition,” was de- 
nounced as a neologism by Monsieur Royer-Collard. The new stone 
could still !)e &lt;listingui.shed by its whiteness under the third arch of

Count d’Arlois entering Notre- Dame, “.Sapristi! I regret the time

Traitors showed tliemselves strij)i)ed even of hypocris}' ; men who 
had gone over to tlie enemy on tlie eve of a battle made no conceal- 
ment of their brilass, and shamelessly walked abroad in &lt;laylight in 
the cynicism of wealth and dignities; de.serters of l.igny and 
Ouatre-llras, in the l&gt;razenness of their purchasted shame, exposed 
the nakedness of their devotion to monarchy, forgetting the com-

These yottng men were remarkable for nothing ; everybody has

What had attracted Dahlia to I.istnlier, to (tHicrs pcriiaps, to i«- 



FANTINK lOi 

dolciice, was her bcatiti ful, rosy fmger-nails. How could such nails 
work ! She who will remain virtuous must have tio compassion for 
her hands. As to Zepliinc, she had cont|iKa‘ed Fanieuil by licr re- 
bellious yet caressing little wu}' of saying sir.’* 

The young men were comrades, tlie young girls were friends, 
Sucli loves are always acc&lt;^mpanied hy such fricndshl|)s. 

Wistloni and pinlosophy are two tilings ; a proof of which is that, 
with all necessary reservations forthese little, irregular households, 
Favr)urite, Zepliine, and Dahlia, were philosophic, and lumtine was 
wise. 

“Wise!** 3'ou will say, and Tholomyes? Solonu;)n would ^inswcr 
that love is a part of wisdom. We content ourselveswilh saying that 
the love of lomtiiu^ was a first, an tnily. a faithful luve.“ 

She was the only one of the ftmr who luu! l^een petted by intt one. 
Fantiue was one of tliuse beings which are brought forth from 
the heart of tlie pe&lt;»|de. Sprung from the most unfalliomable depths 
of social tlarkness, she bore &lt;m tier brow tliemark of theannoymous 
ami unknown. She was born at M— ~ on Who* were her 

panmbs? Name could tell, she had never known either father or 

mother, Siie was ra!h,Ml haiitine why so? because she had never 

hcen known by an\^ other name. At the time of her birth, the Dirt\&gt; 
lory was still in existence. She could have no family name, for she 
had no farnih' ; she could b'lveuoliaplisma! name, for t hen there was 
no diiircli. She was named after the pleasure of the fmst passer-by 
who foum! her. a mere infant, straying barefoiit in the streets. She. 
received a name as she received the water from tlie clouds on her 
hearl when it rained. She was called little lointine, NolMjdy knew 
anvlliing more of her. Such was the luanner in wliich tliis huinati 
heing liad come into life. At the age of ten, Fantine left the city and 
went to serviv'e among the farmers of the suinirlis. At fifteen, she 
came to I kiris, to **seck her fortuned* Fantine was beaut ifu! and re- 
maiiKHl jnire as king us she couhk She was a pretty blonde with i\m 
teeth. Site had gohl and pearls for her dowry, hut the gold was on 
her heail and the pearls in lier iiiouth. 

She worked to live; tlien, also to live, for tlie heart t«j&gt;o has sIh

To him. it was aii amour ; to her a passion. The streets of the 
Latin Quarter, wliich swarm with stuefents and grisetles, saw the 
!)eginning of this dream, Fantine, in those labyrinths of the hil! of 
the Patnheon, where so many lies are knotteti and unUxisecb long 
fled from Tholomyes, !nit in such a way as always to meet him again. 
There is a way of avoiding a person which resembles a search. In 
short, the eclogue to«&gt;k place. 

BlacheviHe, I Jstolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of 
which Thobrnyis was the head. He was the wit of the company.

the pinnace, we have now the steamboat ; v.-e say Fecamp to-clay, as 
we then said Saint Cloud. The Paris of 1862 is a city which has 
France for its suburbs. 

Tlic four couples scrupulously accomplished all the country' follies 
theit possible. It was in the boj,dnning of tiie holidays, and a warm, 
clear summer’s day. The niffht before. Favourite, the only one who 
knew how to write, had written to 'riiolomyes in the name of the 
four : “It is lucky to go out etirly." Imu- this reason, tltcy rose at five 
in the morning, d'hen they went to .Saint Cloud by the coach, looked 
at the dry ctisctidc and exclaimed : “idow beautiful it must be when 
there is any water !“ break ftisted at the Tcfe AUmr, whieh Castaing 
had not yet ptis.sed, .nmused themselves with a gtmie of rings at the 
quincunx of the gretit Itasin, ascended to I,)i(.)genes’ lantern, played 
roulette with mactiroons on the Sevres hritlge, gathered bouquets at 
Puteaux, bought reetl pipes at Neuilly, ate apple jiuifs everywhere, 
and were perfectly ha|)py. 

The young girls nittleil and chattered like uncaged vvarhlers. They 
were tlclirious with joy. Now and then tliey would playfully box the 
cars of the young men. Intoxication of the morning of life 1 Ador- 
able yetirs ! Tlie wing of the dragon-lly trcmldes! &lt;.)h, ye, whoever 
you may he, have you memories of the j«ist ? Ihive you walked in the 
brushwood, thrusting ti.sitle tiie branches for tlie charming tiead be- 
hind ytni ? Mtive i;ott glided Ituighingly down some slojie wet with 
rain, with the woman of your love, who held you back by the hand, 
exclaiming : “Oh. my new boots ! wh.at a condition they are in !” 

Let u.s hasten to .say that that joyous annoyance, a shower, was 
wanting to this good-natured company, althougli Favourite had 
said on setting out, with a magisterial and maternal air: “The 
snails are crawling in the paths. A sign of rain, children,” 

All four were ravishingly beautiful. A good old cla.ssic poet, then 
in renown, a good man who had an Eleanore, the Chevalier de 
X-abouisse, wlio was walking that day under the chestnut trees of 
Saint Cloud, .saw them pass about ten o’clock in the morning, and 
exclaimed, tliinkmg of tlie Graces; “There is one too many!” 
I%vourite, tlie friend of Blacheville, the Old &lt;)ne of twenty-three, 
ran forward un&lt;!er the l»road green l&gt;ranche.s, leajied across tiitches, 
madly .sprang over bushes, and took tlie lead in the gaiety with die 
verve of a young faun. Zephine and Dahlia, whom chance had en- 
dowed with a kind of beauty that was heightened and perfected by 
contrast, kept together through the instinct of coquets still more 
than through friendship, and, leaning on each other, affected Eng- 
lish attitudes : the first keepstakes had just appeared, melancholy 
was in vogue for women, as Byronism was afterwards for men, and 
the locks of the tender sex were b&lt;^nnii:w to fall dishevelled. 
Zephine and Dahlia wore tibeir hair in rolls. Xistolier and FameuH,

engaged in a discussion on their professors, explained to i^antnie 

the difiference between M. Delvincourt and M. Llondeau. ■ 

Blacheville seemed to have been created expressly to carry J^a- 
vourite’s dead-leaf coloured shawl upon.his aim on Sunday. 

Tholomves followed, ruling, presiding over the group. He was 
excessively gay, but one felt the governing power in him. There was 
dictatorship in his joviality; his principal adornment was a pair of 
nankeen pantaloons, cut in the elephant-leg fashion, 'with under- 
stockings of copper-coloured braid ; he had a huge i atten, worth two 
hundred francs, in his hand, and as he denied himself nothing, a 
strange thing called cigar in his mouth. Nothing being sacred to him, 
he was smoking. , , . , 

“This Tholomyes is astonishing,” said the others, with venera- 
tion. “WTat pantaloons ! what energy !” 

As to Fantine, she was joy itself. Her splendid teeth had evidently 
been endoived by God with one function— that of laughing. She car- 
ried in her hand rather than on her head, her little hat of solved 
straw, w'ith long, white strings. Her thick blond tresses, inclined to 
wave, and easily escaping from their confinement, pbfiging her to 
fasten them continually, seemed designed for the flight of Galatea 
under the willows. Her rosy lips babbled with enchantment. Tlie 
comers of her mouth, turned up voluptuously like the antique masks 
of Erigone, seemed to encourage audacity ; but her long, shadowy 
e3'elashes were cast discreetly down towards the lower part of her 
face as if to dieck its festive tendencies. Her whole toilette was inde- 


scribably_ harmonious and enchanting. She wore a dress of mauve 
barege, little reddish-brown buskins, the strings of which were 
crossed over her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and that species 
of spencer, invented at Marseilles, the name of which, cancson, a 
corruption of the words quinse aout in the Canebiiire dialect, signi- 
fies fine -vreather, warmth, and noon. The three others, less timid as 
we have said, wore low-necked dresses, which in summer, beneath 
bonnets covered with flowers, are full of grace and allurement ; but 
by the side of this daring toilette, tire canezou of the blond Fantine, 
with its transparencies, indiscretions, and concealments, at once hid- 
mg and disclosing, seemed a provoking godsend of decency ; and the 
famous court of love, presided over by the Viscountess de Cette, 
with the sea-green eyes, would probably have given the prize for co- 
quetry to this canemu, which had entered the lists for that of mod- 
esty. The simplest is sometimes the wisest. So things go. 

A brilliant face, delicate profile, eyes of a deep blue, heavy eve- 
tashes, Mail arching feet, the wrists and ankles neatly encased, the 
white skin showing here and there the azure aborescence of the 
veins ; a cheek small and fresh, a neck robust as tlut of Egean Juno ;

a voluptuous dimple in the centre, just visible Itmtiekihe mwia&amp;i ; a

gaiety te.tipered with reverie, sculptured and exquisite— such was 
Fantiue, and you divined beneath this dress and tliese ribbons a 
statue, iind in Ihi.s statue a soul. 

I'antiiie was be.-iiitiful, without being too conscious of it. d'hose 
rare dreamei's, tlie mystei-ittus f)riests of the bcauliful, who silently 
conipare all Ibings with perfection, would luive had a dim vision iii 
this little work-wtmian, through the transpun-ncy of Parisian grace, 
of the ancient sacred Knphony. This daughter of obscurity had race. 
She juiHsessed both types t)f beauty- -style and rhythm. .Style is the 
force of tlie ideal, rliylhnt is its niuvement.

P.syche from Venus, luintine had liie long, white, sletider lingers of 
the vestals tliat stir the ashes of the .s;iered lire with a golden rod. 
Althougli she would have refused nothing to Tholoinyes, as might 
be seen but loo well, her faee, in repose, was in the highest degree 
maitleiily ; a kind of serious and tdmost auslere dignity suddenly pos- 
se.ssed it at tiuies, and nothing could be more strange or distpiieiing 
than to set; gaiety vanish tlieie so quickly, anti relleetion insttmtly 
succecii to delight. 'I’hi.s sudileii .seritnisnes,s, somefitiie.'S .strangely

That tlaj was Miiishine from one end to the other. All nature 
sei’ttietl ill he out on a holiday. The parterres of .Saint Clouil were 
balmy with perfumes; the breeze from the .Seine gently waved the 
leaves; the Iwiugh.s were gesticulating in the wind; the hee.s were 
pillaging the jessamine ; a whole crew of huttertlies had iettled hi 
the milttiil, clover, and wild oats. The augu.st jiark of the King of 
France was invaded by a swarm of vagalionds, the birds. 

The four joyous couples shone resplendently in concert with the 
sunshine, the flowers, tnc fieltls, and the trees. -

lace of the capital. It is remarkable that this part of the population 
has also tlecrcased in stature during the last fifty years ; and the peo- 
ple of the faubourgs of 1‘aris are smaller than before the Revolu- 
tion. They are not dangerous. In short, they are good canaille.” 

That a cat may become changed into a lion, prefects of police do 
not believe possible ; nevertheless, it may be, and this is the miracle 
of the people of Paris. Resides, the cat, .so despi.scd by the Count 
Angles, hatl the esteem of the republics of antiquity ; it was the in- 
carnation of liberty in tiieir sight, and. as if to serve as a pendant to 
the wingless Minerva of the Piraius, tliere was, in the pul, die sijuare 
at Corinth, the lironze colossus of a cat. 'Fhe .simple police, of the 
Restoration looked too hopefully on the people of Paris. They are 
by no means such good c;maiiie as is helieved. The Parisian is among 
I''renchme.n what the Athenian was among Greeks. Noliody sk‘eps 
better than he, nobody is more frankly frivolous and idle than he, 
nobody .seems to fm-get things more easily than he ; but do not tnast 
him, notwithstanding ; he is aj&gt;l at all sortsof nonchalance, but wlieu 
tliere is glory to be gainetl, he is wonderful in every species of fury. 
Give him a iiike, and he will play the tenth of August ; give him a 
nm.sket, and you shall have ;ni Austerlit/.. He is the support of Na- 
poleon, and the resource of Danton. Is Iwance in question? he en- 
lists; is lilterty in question ? he tears up the pavement. Beware f his 
hair rising with rage is epic: his blouse drajies itself into a chlamys 
aliout liim. Take cart ! At the first corner, Grenelat will make a Cau- 
dine Forks. When tlie tocsin stiunds, this dweller in the faubourgs 
will grow; tliis little man w'il! ari.sc*, his look will lie terrilile, his 
breath will lieconie a tempe.st, and a blast will go forth from his 
poor, frail lirea.st that might shake the wrinkles tint tif the Alps. 
Thanks to the men of the Paris fanlxnirg.s. the Revolution infused 
into armies, eontiuers F.urojw. Hs: .sings, it is his joy. i'roportion his 
song to ins nature, ami you sliall see ! .So long as he hatithe Carmag- 
nole merely for Ills di&lt;trus. he overthrew only Louis XVL; let him 
sing the Marseillaise, anti he will deliver the world.

turn to our four couples. The dinner, as wc have .said, was over.

TJIE WISDOM OF TllOLOMYKS 

Meantime, while soirie were singing, tlie rest were all noisily talk- 
ing at the same time. There was a perfect uproar. Tholomyes inter- 
fered. 

“],)o not talk at rancloin, nor too fast !” exclaimed he ; “we must 
take time for rellection, if we would be brilliant. Too much impro- 
visation leaves the mind stupidly void. Running lieer gathers no 
foam. Gentlemen, no haste. Mingle dignity with fe.stivity, eat with 
deliberation, feast slowly. Take your time.’See the springVi f it hast- 
ens forward, it is ruined; that i.s, frozen. Excess of zeal kills peach 
and apricot trees. J '-xcess of zeal kills the grace and joy of good din- 
ners. No zeal, gentlemen ! Grimod de la Reyniere is of Talleyrand’s 
opinion.” 

“Tholomyes, let us alone,” said Blacheville. 

“Down with the tyrant 1” cried Fameuil. 

“r.ombarda, .ISombance, and I’ainboche !" exclaimed Listolier. 

“.Sunday still exists,” resumed Idstolier. 

“We are solier,” added Imnieuil. 

“Tholoniye.s,” said Blaclieville, “behold mj' calmness (tnon 
cabnc).” 

“\'ou are its marquis,” replied Tholomyes. 

This indifferent play on words had the effect of a strone thrown 
into a pool, ’riu! Martjuis de Montcalm was a celeln'ated royalist of 
the time. All the frogs were silent. 

“My friends !”^e.xclaimed 'rholomyes, in the tone of a man resum- 
ing his stvay. “Collect yourselves. This pun, though it ftills from 
heaven, .slimild not l&gt;e welcomed with too much woniler, liverything 
that falls in this wi.se is not necessarily worthy of enthu.siasm and 
respect. The pun is the dropping of the soaring spirit. The jest falls, 
it matters not where. And the spirit, after freeing itself from the 
folly, plunges into the clouds. A white spot settling upon a rock 
doe.s not prevent the condor f rom hovering alwive. Far be it from me 
to insult the pun ! I honour it in projwrtion to its merits — no more. 
The most august, mosst sublime, and mo.st charming in humanity 
and perhaps out of humanity, have made plays on words. Jesus 
Christ made a pun on St. I^eter, Moses on Isaac, /Eschylus on roly- 
niees, Cleopatra on Octavius. And mark, that this pun of Qfeopatra 
preceded the battle of Actium, and that, without it, no one would 
have rememliered the city of Toryne, a Greek name 8ignif3dng dip- 
per. This conceded, I return to my exhortation. My brethren, I re- 
peat, no zeal, no noise, no excess, even in witticimis, mirth, gaiety 
and plays on words. Listen to me ; have fte prudence of Amphi- 
alraus, and the boldness of Csesar. There must be a limit, even to

people. The an-oba of Castile contains sixteen litres, the cantaro of 
Alicante twelve, the alnuiclu of the Canaric.s twenty-live, the cuaitia 
of the Baleares twenty-six, anti the boot of Czar Peter thirty. Long 
live the czar, wlio was great, and long live Ins boot, which was still 
greater! Ladies, a friendly counsel ! deceive your neighboiu*s, if it 
seems good to you. The characteristic of hn'e is to rove. Love was 
not made to cower and cnjuch lifee an English housemaid whose 
knees are callused with scrtildiing. Gentle love was made but to rove 
gaily! It has been said to err is human; I say, to err is loving. 
Ladies, I idoIi.se you all. O Zephine, or Josephine, with face more 
than wrinkled, yttu would be charming if you were not cross. Yours 
is like a beautiful face, upon whicli some" one has sat down by mis- 
toke. As to hayourite, oh, nymphs and muses, one day, as Blache- 
ville wa.s cros.sing the Rue Guerin- Boisseau, he saw a beautiful girl 
with white, well-gartered .stockings, who was showing them. The 
prologue plca.se&lt;] him, ;md Bkiclicviilc loved, .Slie whom he loved 
was Favourite. Oh, Favourite ! Thou lia.st Ionian lips. There was a 
Greek painter, Fnphorion, who wa.s surnamed painter of Ups. This 
Greek Jilone would li.ave keen worth^f to paint thy mouth. Li.sten! 
before thee, there w.is no crejiture worthy the mime. Thou wert 
made to receive the ajiple like Venus, or to eat it like Eve. Beautly 
begins with thee. 1 have siioken of lCvc; .she was of thy creation, 
'■niou^deseryest tlie patent for the invention of beautiful women. 
Oh, Favourite, J cease to thou you, for I. pass from jjoetry to pi'o.se. 
You spoke just now of my name. It moved me; but, whatever we 
do, let us not trinst to names, they may be deceitful. I am called 
Felix, 1 am not happy. Words are deceivers. Do not blindly accept 
the indication.s which they give. It would lie a mi.stakc to write to 
Liege for corks or to J\au for gloves. Aiiss Dalilia, in your place, I 
should call myself Rose. The (lower should liave fragrance, and 
woman .slioidti htn 'i wit 1 stiy nothing of E’antine, she is visionary, 
dreamy, pensive, .sensitive ; she is a phantom with the form of a 
nymph, {ind the mmlesty of a nun, who has strayed into the life of a 
grisette, hut who takes refuge in illusion.?, and who sings, an&lt;l prays, 
and gtiztis at the sky without knowing clearly what she sees nor 
what she does, and wlio, with eyes lixed on lieiiven, wanders in a 
garden among more birds than exist there. Oh, I''antine, know this: 
L 'I'holoniyes, am an illusion — hut .she &lt;loes not even hear me— -the 
fair daughter of chimeras ! N evert hele.ss, everjihing on her is fresh- 
ness, gentleness, youth, soft, niatinal clearness. Oh, Fantine, worthy 
to he calleti Marguerite or Pearl, you are a Jewel of the purest 
water. Ladies, a second counsel, do not marry ; marriage is a graft; 
it may take well or ill. Shun the risk. But what do I say ? I am 
wasting my words. Women are incurable on the subject of wed- 
dings, and all that we wise men can say will not hinder vestmakers 
and gaiter-binders from dreaming about husbands loaded witl\'dia-

And, by mistake, he kissed Favourite.

“The dinners are l)etter at Edou’s than at Bombarda’s,” e.'cclaimed 
Zephine. 

“I like Bombarda l&gt;cttcr than lulon,” .s;iid Blacheville. “There is 
more luxury. It is more Asi.atic. See the lower hall. There are mir- 
rors {(/laces) on tlic walks.” 

“I prefer ice.s {(/luces) on my plate,” said Favourite. 

Blacheville pcrsi.sted. 

"Look at the knives. 1'he handles are silver at Bombarda's, and 
bone at Edtm's. Now, silver is more precious than bone.” 

“Except vvlievi it i.s oji the chin,” observed Tholomyes. 

He looked out at this moment at the dome of the Invalides, which, 
was visible from Bombarda’s window.s. 

There was a pause. 

"Tholomyes,” cried I'ameuil, "Listolier ami I have just had a dis- 
cussion.” 

“A discussion is good,” replied Tholomyes, “a quarrel is better.” 

“We were tliscus.sing philosophy.” 

“I have no ohjection ” 

“Which do you ju’cfer, Descartes or Spinoza ?” 

“Desaugiens,” .said Tholomyls. 

I'his decision rendered, he i/rank, and resumeil : 

“I consent to live. All is not over on earth, since we can yet rea- 
son falsely. 1 render thanks for this to the immortal gods. We lie. 
but we laugh. We affirm, but we doubt. The unexpected shoots 
forth from a syllogism. It i.s fine. There are men still on earth whe 
know how to open and shut pleasantly the surprise boxes of para- 
dox. Know, ladies, that this wine you are dnnking so calmly, is 
Madeira from the vineyard of Cotiral das Frerras, which is three 
hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of the ■'ea. Attei- 
tion while you drink! three hundred and seventeen fathoms! and 
M. Bombarda. this magnificent restaurateur, givM you these three

us a moment.” 

“It begins with a kiss,” said Blacheville. 

“On tlie foreliead,” added Tholomyis. 

Each one gravely placed a kiss on the forehead of his mistress ; 
after which they directed their steps towards the door, all four in 
file, laying their fingers on their lips. 

Favourite clapped her hands as they went out. 

“It is amusing already,” said she. 

“Do not be too long,” murmured Fantine. “We are waiting for 
you."

Tiik girls, left alone, leanetl tlieir elbows on the window sills in 
couples, and chattered together, bending their heads and speaking 
from one window to the other. 

They saw the young men go i»ut of Boinliarda’s, ann in arm ; 
they turned round, m:itle signals to them laughingly, then disap- 
peared in the dusty .Sunday crowd which takes possession of the 
Champs-Elysecis once a tveek. 

“Do not be long !” cried b^antine. ^ 

“What lire they going to bring us ?" said Zcphine. 

“Surly .s imetlung pretty," said Dahlia. 

“I hope it will lie gold," rcsumetl luivourite. 

They were soon mstracted by the stir on the water’s edge, which 
they distinguished tlirough tlie 'branches of the tall trees, and which 
diverted them greatly. It was the hour for tlie departure of the 
mails and diligences. Almost all the stagecoaches to the south and 
west, passed at that time by the Clmmps-Elysees. The greater part 
followetl the qiiai and went out through the Barriere l*as.sy. F.very 
minute some huge vehicle, painted yellow and black, lieavily loaded, 
noisily harnessed, tli.storteii with uiails, awnings, and vahses, full 
of heads that were constantly di.sappearing, grinding the curb- 
stones, turning the i&gt;avements into f1int.s, ritshed through the crowd, 
throwing out sparks like a forge, with dust for smokfc and an air, 
of fury. This hubljub delighted the young girls. Favourite cx- 
claimctl ; , 

“What an uproar; one would say that heaps of chains were tak- 
ing flight." , . . 

It so happened that one of these vehicles whidi could be distin 
guished with difficulty through the obscurity of fte elms, stopped 
for a mom«at, ffien set out a^in on a; gallop. This surprised Fan'

“For nearly two years we have made you happy. Bear us no ill

“Signed: Blacheville, 
Fameuil, 

Listolier, 

Felix TiioLOMYis. 

“P. S. The dinner is paid for.” 

The four girls gazed at each other. 

Favourite was the first to bi’eak silence. 

“Well !” said she, “it is a good farce all the same.” 

“It is very droll,” said Zephine. 

“It must have been Blacheville that had the idea,” resumed Fav- 
ourite. “This makes me in love with him. Soon loved, soon gone. 
That is the .story.” 

“No,” said Dahlia, “it is an idea of Tholomyes. This is clear.” 

“In that case,” returned Favourite, “down with Bladteville, and 
long live Tholomyes !” 

“Long live Tholomyes !” cried Dahlia and Zephine. 

And they burst into laughter. 

Fantine laughed like the rest. 

An hour afterwards, when .she had re-entered her chamber, she 
wept. I f w'as her first love, as we have said ; she had given herself 
to this Tholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a cliild.

Fil-st to obstruct the lane, and then to complete its work of rust. 
Tiiere is in tiie old social order a host of institutions which we find 
like this across our path in the full light of day, and whicli present 
no other reasons for l)cing there. 

Tlie middle of tlie chain was hanging quite near the ground, un- 
der t!ie axle ; aiid upon the bend, as on a swinging rope, two little 
girls were seated tliat evening in exquisite grouping, the smaller, 
eighteen months old, in the lap of the larger, who was two years and 
a half old. ■ ‘ 

A handkerchief carefully knotted kept them from falling. A 
mother, looking upon this frightful chain, had said: “Ah! there is 
a plaything for’ my children !” 

The nuliant children, })icture,squely and tastefully decked, might 
be fancied two roses twining the rusty iron, with their triumphantly 
sparkling cye.s, and their hlooming, laughing faces. One was a rosy 
blonde, tlie oilier ajirunette ; their artless facCvS were two ravi.shing 
surprises; the perfume that was shed ujion the air by a flowering 
shrub ne;ir by seemeil their own out-hreathings ; tire smaller one was 
showing lier pretty little bod}' with the chaste indecency of baby- 
hood. Aliovc and around lhe.se delicate heads, moulded in happiness 
and batheil in light, the gigantic carriage, black with rust and al- 
most frightful witii its entjmgled curves and abrupt angles, arched 
like the mouth of a cavern. 

Tlie mother, a woman whose appearance was rather forbidding, 
but touching at this moment, was seated on the sill of the inn, swing- 
ing the two children by a long .string, while she brooded them with 
her eyes for fear of accident with that animal but heavenly expres- 
sion peculiar to maternity. At each vibration the hideous links ut- 
tered a creaking ntiise like an angry cry; the little ones were in 
ecsta.des, the setting sun mingled in the joy, and nothing could be 
more chaniiing than this caprice of chance which made of a Titan’s 
chain a swing for cherubim. 

While rocking the babes the mother sang with a voice out of tune 
a then popular .song: 

“II le faut, disait un guerricr.” 

Her song anti watching her children prevented her hearing and 
seeing what was passing in the street. 

I'ome one, however, had approached her as she was twginningthe 
first couplet of the song, and suddenly she heard a voice say quite 
near her ear: 

"You have two pretty children there, madamc." 

"A la belle et tendre Imogine," 

answered tlie mother, cemtinuing her song; tiien she turned her 
head.

they had no longer cause to be so. Fantine was left alone. The father 
of her child gone — Alas ! sucli partings are irrevocable — she found 
herself absolutely isolated, with the halht of labour lost, and the 
taste for pleasure acquired. l.cd by her liaison with Tholomyes to 
disdain the small business that she knew how tu do, she had neg- 
lected her oi)i)ortunities, they were all gone. No resource. Fantine 
could scarcely read, and did not know how to write. She had only 
been taught in chihlhood how to sign her name. She had a letter 
written by a public letter-writer to 'rholom_ves, then a second, then 
a third. Tholomyes had i‘eplie»l to none of them. One day, Fantine 
heard some old women saying as they saw her child: “Do people 
ever take such cliiklren to heart? They only shrug their shoulders 
at such children !“ 'Fhcn she thought of Tholomyes, who shrugged 
his shoulders at hi.s cliild, and who did not take this innocent chiUi to 
heart, aiul her heart Ijecame daik in the place that was his. What 
should she &lt;lo ? .She ha&lt;l no one to ask, .She had committed a fault ; 
but, in the depths of her nature, we know dwelt modesty and vir- 
tue. She had a vague feeling that she was on the eve of falling into 
distres.s, of .sli[)ping into the street. She mu.st have courage ; she had 
it, aiul Iiore uj) liravcly. I'he idea oceiirred to her Of returning to her 

native village M— — - sur M , there perhaps .some one would 

know her, and give her work. Yes, but she must hide her fault. And 
she had a confused glimp.se of the possible necessity of a separation 
still more painful thaii the first. Her heart ached, but she took her 
resolution. It will be seen that Fantine j)osses.sed the stern courage 
of life. She ha&lt;i {ilrea&lt;ly valiantly renounced her finery, was draped 
in calico, and had put all her sil’k.s, her gew-gaws, her riblwns, and 
laces on her daughter— the only vanity that remained, and that a 
holy one. She .sold all she had, which gave her two hundred francs ; 
when her little debts were paid, she had but atout eighty left. At 
twenty-two years of age, on a fine spring morning, she left Paris, 
carrying her child on her back. He who bad seen the two passing, 
must h.ive pitied them. The woman had nothing in the world but 
this child, and this child had nothing in the world but this woman. 
Fantine had nursed her child ; that had weakened her chest some- 
what, and she coughed slightly. 

We shall have no further need to speak of M. F^lix Tholomyis. 
We will only say here, that twenty years later, under King ^uis 
Philippe, he was a fat provincial attorney, rich and influeatkl, a 
wise elector and rigid juryman; always, however, a man of 
pleasure. 

Towards noon, after having, for the s^e of rett, travdled from 
time to time at a cost of three or four cents a kaqpift, in what they 
called then the Petites VoHures of the «viroi«&gt; m Pnris, Fantine 

reached Montf^rmefl, and stood in Boulanger lane.

One would say that they felt themselves to be angels, and knew us 
to be human. I'hen the child Iwgan to laugh, and, although the 
mother re-stniined her, slip,&gt;cd to tlie ground, with the indomitable 
energy of a little one that wants to run about. All at once she per- 
ceived the two others in their .swing, stopped short, and put out her 
tongue in token of .admiration. 

Motlier 'l'lienardier untied the childreit and took them from the 
swing stiying : 

“I’lay lijg&lt;aher. all three of you." 

At that .age acapj.aint.ance is easy, and in a moment the little The- 
nardiers were pl.iying with the new-comer, nuiking holes in tlie 
ground to their inten.se &lt;lclight. 

Thi.s new -conier wtis very sprightly : the goodness of the mothei 
is written in the gaiety of the child’; .she had taken a splinter of 
wootl, wliich she tjsed as a sspinie, aiu! was stoutly digging a hole fit 
for a lly. The gr.avetligger's work is charming w'hen done by a cliiUI. 

The two women continued to cli.at. 

“What do your c.all your brat ?’’ 

“Cosette," 

For fosi'tte read Fuphr.asie. 'fhe name of the little one was Hu* 
phrasie. But the niotiier had made Cosette out of it, by that .sweet 
and ciianning instinct of mothers and of the people, who change 
jt'wefa into I’epita, and Fnmgoise into Sillette, That is a kind of de- 
rivation which dcrange.s and disconcerts all the science of etymolo- 
gists. We knew a grandmotlier who succeeded in making from 
Theodore, (Inon, 

"llow old is she?" 

“.She i.s going on three years." 

“The age of my oldest.^’ 

Tlio tliree girls were grouped in an attitude of deep anxiety and 
bliss ; a gretil event ha&lt;l occurred ; a large worm h.ad come out of the 
ground ; they were afniid of it. and yet in cc.stasies over It. 

Their bright foreheads toucheii each other: three heads in one 
halo of glory. 

"ChiUiren," exclaimed the Th&lt;5nardier mother ; "how soon they 
know one another. Sec them I one would swear they were three sis- 
ters." 

These words were tlie spark which the other mother was prob- 
ably awaiting. She seized the hand of Madame Thenardier and said ; 

"Will you keep my child for me?" 

Madame Thenardier made a motion of surprise, which was 
neither consent nor refusal. 

Cosette’a mother continued : » 

"You see I cannot take my child into the oountry. Work forMda 
it. With a child I could not fmd a place there; they are kj absurd in 
that district It is God who has led me bef^ your inn. The of

II 

FIRST SKETCH OF TWO EQUIVOCAL FACES 

The captured mouse was a very puny one, but the cat exulted even 
over a lean mouse. 

What were the Thenardiers ? 

We will say but a word just here ; by-and-by the sketch shall be 
completed. 

They belonged to that bastard class farmed of low people who 
have risen, and intelligent people who have fallen, which lies be- 
tween the classes called middle and lower, and which unites some of 
the faults of the latter with nearly all the vices of the former, with- 
out possessing the generous impulses of the workman, or the re- 
spectability of the bourgeoi.s. 

They were of those tlwarfish natures, which, if perdiance heated 
by some sullen lire, easily become monstrous. The woman was at 
heart a brute ; the man a blackguard : both in the highest degree 
capable of that hideous species of progress which can be made to- 
wards evil. There are souls which, craldike, crawl continuajly to- 
wards darkness, going back in life rather than advancing in it; us- 
ing what experience they have to increase their deformity ; growing 
wtirsc without ceasing, and becoming steeped more and more thor- 
oughly in an intensifying wickedness. Such souls were this man and 
this woman. 

The man especially would have been a puzzle to a physiognomist. 
We have only to look at .some men to distrust them, for wc feel the 
darkness of their souls in two ways. They are re.stless as to what is 
behind them, and threatening as to what is before them. They are 
full of mystery. We can no more answer for what they have done, 
than for what they will do. The shadow in their looks denounces 
them. 1 f we hear them utter a word, or see them make a gesture, we 
catch glimpses of guilty secrets in their past, and dark mystepes in 
their future. 

This Thenardier, if we may believe him, had been a soldier, a 
sergeant he said ; he probably had made the campaign of 1815, and 
had even borne himself bravely acconling to all that appeared. We 
shall see hereafter in what his bravery consisted. The si^^ of h» 
inn was an allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it 
himself, for he knew how to do a little of everything— 4»dly. 

^ It was the time when the antique classical romance, which, after 
having been ClelU, sank to Lodohka, always noble, but bee»ming 
more and more vulgar, falling from Mdlle. de Scodeii to Madame 
Boumon-Malarme, and from Madams de Lafayette to Madame 
Barthflemy-Hadot, was firing the loviag sends of the portresses of 
Paris, ano making some ravages evm sS' the suDn^. Madame 
Thenardier was just inteliti^ enou^ to lead that sort &lt;p{ hook.

Hei' mother, as we shall see hereafter, who had found a place at 

]\^ sur M wrote, or rather had some one write for her, 

every month, inquiring news of her child. The Thenardiers replied 
invariably ; 

“Cossette is doing wonderfully well.” 

The six months passed away : the mother sent seven francs for 
the seventh month, and continued to send this sum regularly month 
after month. The year was not ended before I'henardier said : ‘‘A 
pretty price that is. What does she expect us to do for her seven 
francs?” And he wrote demanding twelve francs. The mother, 
whom he persuaded that her child w'as happy and doing well, as- 
sented, and forwarded the twelve francs. 

There are certain natures which cannot have love on one side 
without hatred on the other. This Thenardier mother passionately 
loved her own little ones : this made her detest the young stranger. 
It is sad to think that a mother’s love can iiave such a dark side. 
Little as was the place Cosette occupied in the house, it seemed to 
her that this little was taken from her children, and that the little 
one lessenecl tlie air hers bveathe&lt;l. This woman, like many women 
of her kind, had a certain amount of caresses, and blows, and hard 
words to dispense each day. 1 f she had not had Cosette, it is certain 
that her daughters, idolised as they were, would have received all, 
but the little' stranger did them the service to attract the blows to 
herself; her chikiren had only the caresses. Cosette could not stir 
that she did not draw down upon herself a hailstorm of undeserved 
and severe chastisements. A weak, .soft little one who knew nothing 
of this world, or of God, continually ill-treated, scolded, punished, 
beaten, she saw beside her two other young things like herself, who 
lived in a halo of glory ! 

The woman was unkind to Cosette, Eponine and Azelma were 
unkind also. Chikiren at that age are only copies of the mother • the 
size is reduced, that is all. 

A year passed and then another. 

People u.sed to say in the village : 

“What: good peojilc these Thenardiens are! I’hey are not rich, 
and yet tliiu' hriiig up a poor child, that has been left with them.” 

They tin ujght Cosette was forgotten by her mother. 

Meantime Thenartlier. having learned in some obscure way that 
the child was prohalilv illegitimate, and that its mother could not 
acknowledge it, demanded fifteen francs a month, saying “tliat the 
‘creature’ was growing and eating,” and threatening to send her 
away. "She won’t humbug me,” he exclaimed, "I will confound her 
with the brat in the midst of her concealment. I roust have more 
money,” The mother paid the fifteen francs. 

From year to year the child grew, and her misery also,

BOOK FIFTH— THE DESCENT 
I 


HISTOKY OF AN IMPROVEMENT IN JET-WORK 

What had become of this mother, in the meanwhile, who, accord- 
ing to the people of Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her 
child ? where was she ? what was she doing ? 

After leaving her little Cosette with the 'J'henardiers, she went on 
her way and arrived at M sur M . 

This, it will be remembered, was in 1818. 

Fantine had left the province some twelve years before, and 
M sur M had greatly changed in appearance. While Fan- 

line had been slowly sinking deeper and deeper into misery, her 
native village had been prosperous. 

Within about two years there had been accomplished there one 
of those^ industrial changes which are the great events of small 
communities. 

This circumstance is important and we think it well to relate it, 
we might even say to italici.se it. 

From time immemorial the special occupation of the inhabitants 
of M— — sur M — — - had been the imitation of English jets and 
German black glas.s trinkets. The business had always been dull in 
consequence of the high price of the raw material, which reacted 

upon the manufacture. At the time of Fantine’s return to M 

sur M an entire transformation had been effected in the pro- 

duction of these ‘black goods.’ Towards the end of the year 1815, 
an unknown man had established himself in the city, and had con- 
ceived the idea of substituting gum-lac for resin in the manu- 
facture; and for bracelets, in particular, he made the clasps by 
simply bending the ends of the metal together instead of soldering 
them. 

This very slight change had worked a revolution. 

This very slight change had in fact reduced the price of the raw 
material enormously, and this had rendered it possible, first, to 
raise the wages of the labourer — a benefit to the country— sec- 
ondly, to improve the quality of the goods — an advantage for the 
consumer — and thirdly, to sell them at a lower price even while 
making three times the profit— a gain for the inanufacturer. 

Thus we have three results from one idea.

the arrival of Father Madeleine, the whole region was languishing, 
now it was all alive with the healthy strength of labour. An active 
circulation kindled everything and penetrated everywhere. Idleness 
and misery were unknown. 1‘here was no pocket so obscure that it 
did not contain some money and no dwelling so poor that it was 
not the abode of some joy. 

Father Madeleine employed everybody ; he had only one condi- 
tion, "Be an honest man !” “Be an honest woman !” 

As we have said, in the midst of this activity, of which he was 
the cause and the pivot, Father Madeleine had made his fortune, 
but, very strangely for a mere man of business, that did not appear 
to be his principal care. It seemed that he though*' much for others, 
and little for himself. In 1820, it was known that he had six hundred 
and thirty thousand francs standing to his credit in the banking- 
house of Laffittc; but before setting a.side this six hundred and 
thirty thousaiul francs for nimself, lie had expended more than a 
million for the city and fur the poor. 

The hospital was poorly endowed, and he made provision for ten 

additional beds. M sur M~ — is divided into the upper city 

and the lower city. The lower city, where he lived, had only one 
school-hou.se, a mi.scralile hovel which was fast going to ruin ; he 
built two, one. for girls, and the other for boys, and paid the two 
teachers, from Ids own pocket, double the amount of their meagre 
salary from the government ; and one day, he said to a neighbour 
who expressed surpri.se at this: “The two highest functionaries of 
the .state are the nurse and the schoolinaster.” He built, at his own 
e.xpense, a housc of refuge, an institution then alniost unknown in 
France, and provided a fund for old and infirm labourers. About his 
factory, as a centre, a new quarter of the city had rapidly grown up, 
containing many indigent families, and he e.stablished a phannacy 
that was free to all. 

At first, when he began to attract the public attention, tlje good 
people would say : “This is a fellow who wishes to get rich.” When 
they saw him enrich the country before he enriched himself, the 
same good people said : “This man is ambitious." This seemed the 
more probable, since he was religious and observed the forms of 
the church, to a certain extent, a thing much approved in those 
days. He went regularly to hear mass eveiy Sunday. The local 
deputy, who scented rivalry everywhere, was not slow to borrow 
trouble on account of Madeleine’s religion. This deputy, who had 
been a member of the Corps Legislatif of the Empire, partook of 
the religious ideas of a Father of the Oratory, known by the naip&lt; 
of Fouchi, Duke of Otranto, whose creature and friaid he had 
been. In private he jested a little about God. But when he saw the 
rich mantifacturer, Madeleine, go to low mass af seven O’clock, h« 
foresaw a possible candidate in opposition to Mmself, and be re

honours, they said, “He is an adventurer.” When they saw him 
repel the advances of the fashionable, they said, “He is a brute.” 

In 1820, live years after his arrival at M sur M , tlie ser- 

vices that he had rendei'ed to the region where so brilliant, and the 
wish of the whole population was so unanimous, that theiking 
again appointed him mayor of the city. He refused again ; but the 
prefect resisted his detennination, the principal citizens came and 
urged him to accept, and the people in the streets begged him to do 
so ; all insisted .so strongly that at last he yielded. It was remarked 
, that what appeared most of all to bring him to this determination, 
i was the almost angry exclamation of an old woman belonging to 
the poorer class, who cried out to him from her door-stone, with 
some temper : 

“A good mayor is a good thing. Are you afraid of the good you 
can do ?” 

This was the third step in his ascent. Ihither Madeleine had be- 
come Monsieur Madeleine, and Monsieur Madeleine now became 
Monsieur the Mayor.

Nevertheless he remained as .simple as at first. He had grey hair, 
a serious eye, the brown complexif)n of a labourer, and the thought- 
ful countenance of a philosopher. 1 le usually wmre a hat with a wide 
brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He ful- 
filled his duties as mayor, but lieyontl that his life was isolated. He 
talked with very few persons. He shrank from compliments, and 
with a touch of the hat walked on rapidly ; he smiled to avoid talk- 
ing, and gave to avoid smiling. The women said of him: “What a 
good bear!” His pleasure was to walk in the fields. 

He always took his meals alone with a book open before him in 
which he read. His library was small but well selected. He loved 
books ; books are cold but sure friends. As his growing fortune gave 
him more leisure, it seemed that he profited by it to cultivate his 

mind. Since he had been at M- — sur M , it was remaned 

from year to year that his language became more polished, choicer, 
and more gentle. 

In his walks he liked to carry a gun, though he seldom used it. 
When he did so, however, his aim was frightfully certatou He never 
killed an inoffensive animal, and never fired at any of the small 
birds. / 

Although he was no longer young, it was repotted that he was of 
prodigious stttngffi. He would offer a to any one who

ilsually done. He would steal into houses in the evening, and fur- 
tively mount the stairs. A poor devil, on returning to liis garret, 
would find that his door had been opened, sometimes even forced, 
during his absence. The poor man would cry out: “Some thief has 
been liere !” Wlicn he got in, the first thing that he would see would 
be a piece of gold lying on the table. “The thief” wlio had been there 
was Father Madeleine. 

He was al'fable and sad. The people used to say : “There is a rich 
man wlio does not show pride. There is a fortunate man who does 
not appear contentetl.” 

Some pretended that he was a my.steriouB personage, and de- 
clared tliat no one ever %vent into his room, which was a time 
anchorite’s cell furnished with hour-glas.ses, and enlivened with 
death’s heads and cro.ss-bones. So much was said of this kind that 

some of the more misclnevous of the elegant young ladies of M 

sur — called on him one day and said : “Monsieur Mayor, will 
you show us your room? We have heard that it is a grotto.” He 
smiled, and introduced them on the spot to this “grotto.” They were 
well punished for their curiosity. It was a room very well fitted up 
with mahogany furniture, ugly as all furniture of that kind is, and 
the walls covered with shilling paper. They could see not'-.ing but 
two candlesticks of antique form that stood on the mantel, and ap- 
peared to bo silver, “for they were marked," a remark full of the 
spirit (jf these little towns. 

Ihit none the less did it continue to be said that nobody ever went 
into that chamber, and that it was a hermit’s cave, a place of dreams, 
a hole, a tomb. 

I t was also whispered that he had “immense” sums deposited w'ith 
Laffitte, with the special condition that they were always at his im- 
mediate command, in .such a way, it was added, that Monsieur 
Madeleine might arrive in the nniniing at X.affitte’s, sign a receipt 
and carry away his two or three millions in ten minutes. In reality 
these “two or three millions” dwindled &lt;lown, as we have said, to | 
six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs.

MONSIEUR MAUELKINE IN MOUHNING 

NeaIJ the beginning of the year 1821 , the journals annountfed the 
decease of Monsieur Myriel, Bishop of D , “suraamed Mon- 

seigneur Bienvenu,” who died in the odour of sanctity at the age 
of eighty-two years. 

The Bishop of D •, to add an' incident which the journals 

omitted, had been blin J for several years before he died, and was 
content therewith, li'r sister b'inf with him.

It appeared to throw some light upon the origin of Monsieur Made- 
leine. The conclusion was tliat be was in some way related to the 

venerable bishop. “H e wears black for the Bisho p of D was 

the talk of the drawing-rooms ; it elevated Monsieur Madeleine very 
much, and gave him suddenly, and in a trice, marked consideration 

in the noble world of M sur M . The microscopic Faubourg 

Saint Germain of the little place thought of raising the quai'antine 
for Monsieur Madeleine, the probable relative of a bishop. Mon- 
sieur Madeleine perceived the advancement that he had obtained, by 
the greater reverence of the old ladies, and the more frequent smiles 
of the young ladies. One evening, one of the dowagers of that little 
great world, curious by right of age, ventured to ask him : “The 
mayor is doubtless a relative of the late Bishop of D ?” 

He sai&lt;l : “No, madame.” 

“But,” the dowager persisted, “you wear mourning for him?” 

He answered : “In my youth I was a servant in hi.s family.” 

_ It was also remarked that whenever there passed through the 
city a young Savoyard who was tramping about the country in 
search of chimneys to .sweep, the mayor would send for him, ask 
his name and give him money. The little Savoyards told each other, 
and many of them passed that way. 


V 

VAGtIK FLA.SHE.S IN THE HORIZON 

I-ITTI.E by little in the lapse of time all opposition had ceased. At 
first there liad been, as always happens with those who vise by their 
own efforts, slanders and calumnies against Mon.sieur Madeleine, 
soon this was reduced to satire, then it was only wit, then it van- 
ished entirely ; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, and 
there came a moment, alxiut 1821, when the words Monsieur the 

Mayor were pronounced at M sur M with almost the same 

accent as the words Monseigneur the Bishop at D — - in 181S, 
People came from thirty miles around to consult Monsieur Made- 
leine. He settled differences, he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled 
enemies. Everybody, of his own will, chose him for judge. He 
seemed to have the book of the natural law by heart. A conta^on 
of veneration had, in the course of six or seven years, step by step, 
spread over the whole country. 

^ One man alone, in the city and its neighbourhood, held himself en- 
tirely clear from this contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine 
did, he remained indifferent, as if a sort of iasfinet, unchangeable 
and imperturbable, kept him awake and c« the watch. It would 
seem, inde^, that there is in certain men the veritable instinct of a

cation, well attended to, can always draw out of a soul, whatever it 
may be, the usefulness that it contains.. 

Be this said, nevertheless, fi’om the restricted point of view of 
the apparent earthly life, and without prejudice to the deep ques- 
tion of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings that are not 
man. The visible me in no way authorises the thinker to deny the 
latent me. With this reservation, let us pass on. 

Now, if we admit for a moment that there is in every man some 
one of the species of the animal creation, it will be easy for us to 
describe the guardian of the peace, Javert. ^ 

1 he peasants of the Asturias believe that in every litter of wolves 
there is one dog, which is killed by the mother, lest on growing up 
it should devour the other little ones. 

Give a human face to this dog son of a wolf, and you will have 
Javert. 

Javert was born in a prison. His mother was a fortune-teller 
wliose husl,)and was in the galleys. He giTw up to think himself 
without the pale of society, and despaired of ever entering it. He 
noticed that society closes its doors, without pity, on two classes of 
men, those who attack it and those who guard it ; he could choose 
between these two classes only ; at the same time he felt that he had 
an indescribable ba.sis of rectitude, order, and honesty, associated 
with an inxpressible hatred for that gypsy race to which he be- 
longed. He entered the police. He succeeded. At forty he was an 
inspectoi’. 

In his youth he had been stationed in the galleys at the South. 

Before going further, let us understand what we mean by the 
words human face, which we have just now applied to Javert. 

The human face of Tavert consisted of a snub nose, with two 
deep nostrils, which were bordered hy large bushy whiskers that 
covered both his cheeks. One felt ill at ease the first time he saw 
those two forests and those two caverns. Wlien Javert laughed, 
winch was rarely and terribly, his thin lips parted, and showed, not 
only his teeth, but his gums ; and around his nose there was a 
wrinkle as broad and wild as the muzr.le of a fallow deer. Javert, 
wlien serious, was a bull-dog ; when he laughed, he was a tiger. Fot 
the rest, a small head, large jaws, hair hiding the forehead and fall- 
ing (, ver the eyel)rows, between the eyes a permanent central frown, 
a gloomy look, a mouth pinched and frightful, and an air of fierce 
cotnmand. . , 

This man was a compound of two sentiments, very simple and 
very good in themselves, l&gt;ut he almost made them evil by his ex- 
aggeration of them ; respect for authority and hatred of rebellion ; 
and in his eyes, theft, murder, all crimes, were only forms of re- 
bellion. In his strong and implicit faith he included all who held anV 
function in th^ state, from the prime mimster to the constable. He

Such was this formidahle mart. 



F A N T I N E 145 

Javert was like an eye always fixed on Monsieur Madeleine ; an 
eye full of suspicion and conjectui'e* Monsieur Madeleine finally 
noticed it, but seemed to consider it of no consequence* He asked 
no question of Javert, he neither sought him nor shunned him, he 
endured this unpleasant and anno3dng stare without appearing to 
pay any attention to it. He treated Javert as he did everybody else, 
at ease and with kindness* 

F rom some words that Javeit had dropped, it was guessed that 
he had secretly hunted up, with that curiosity which belongs to his 
race, and which is more a matter of instinct than of will, all the 
traces of his previous life wdiich Father Madeleine had left else- 
wliere* He npi:)eared to know, and he said sometimes in a coveit 
way, that somebody had gathered certain information in a certain 
region about a certain missing family. Once he hai)pene(l to say, 
spealcing to himself ; *M. tliink 1 have got him !*' Then for three days 
he remained moody without speaking a wonl. It appeared that the 
clue which lie thought lie had was broken. 

But, and this is tlie necessary corrective to what the meaning of 
certain words mtiy have ]&gt;resenle&lt;l in too alisoute a sense, there 
can be nothing retilly infallible in a human creature, ami tlie very 
pecuHaritj^ of instinct is tliat it can lie disturlied, follovved up, and 
routed. Were this not so it would superior to intelligence, and 
the licast w'ould lie in po*ssession of a purer light than man. 

Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the completelj 
n«atural air and tlie traiiquillity of Monsieur Madeleine. 

One (lay, however, Ins strange manner appeared to make an im- 
pression upon Monsieur Madeleine. The occasion was this : 


VI 

FATH m FA UC I rntEVENT 

MoNSTiaTR MAnnLKiNK was ’walking one morning along one of the 
unpuvetl alleys of *siir M * he lieard a shouting and saw^ 

a cnnvil at a little distance. He went to the spot. An old man, 
nauu»d imtlier Fauchekvent, lutd fallen imdcr lus cart, his horse 
being tlirown down. 

This Faucbelevent was one of the few who were still enemies of 
Monsieur Madeleine at this time. When Madeleine arrived in the 
place, the business of Fauchelevent, wlio was a notary of long-- 
standing, and vtry well-read for a rustic, was beginning to decline. 
Fauchelevent haa seen this mere artisan grow rich, while he him- 
self, a professional man, had been going to ruin. This had filled him 
with jealousy, and he had done what he could on all occasions to 
injure Madeleine. Then came hankruptciy, and the old man, having

nothing but a horse and cart, as he was wilhuut family^ and 

out children, was compelled to earn his living; as a 

The horse had his thighs broken, anil coukl it-a sii;\ Tot' rild tu.ai

Javert continued;

'f hen, looking fixedly at Monsieur Madeleine, he went on empha- 
sising eveiy word that he uttered : 

^'Monsieur Madeleine, I have known but one man capable of 
doing what you call for/' 

Madeleine shuddered. 

Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without taking his 
eyes fi'om Madeleine: 

‘‘lie was a convict.'' 

*^Ah !’' said Madeleine. 

‘in the galleys at Toulon/' 

Madeleine became pale. 

Meanwhile the cart was slowly settling down. Father Fauchele- 
vent roared and screamed : 

“I am dying! my ribs are breaking! a jack! anything! oh!" 
Madeleine looked around him; 

‘is tlicre nobody, tlien, who wants to earn twenty louis and save 
this poor old man's life?" 

None of the 1)ystandcrs moved. Javert resumed: 

‘i have known but one man who could take the place of a jack; 
that was that convict/' 

“Oh ! how it crushes me !" cried tlie old man. 

Madeleine raised his head, met the falcon eye of Javert still fixed 
upon him, looked at the immovable peasants, and smiled sadly. 
Then, witliout saying a word, he fell on his knees, and even before 
the crowd had time to utter a cry, he was under the cart. 

There was an awful moment of suspense and of silence. 
Madeleine, l)ang almost flat under the fearful weight, was twice 
seen to try in vain to bring his elbows and knees nearer together. 
They cried out to him : “Father Madeleine ! come out from there !" 
Okrh^iuchdevent himself said : “Monsieur Madeleine ! go away ! I 
must die, you see that; leave me! you will be crushed too/' Made- 
leine made no answer. 

The bystanders held their breath. The wheels were still sinking 
and it luid now become almost impossilde for Madeleine to extricate 
hininelf. 

Xll at once the enormous mass started, the cart rose slowly, the 
wheels came half out of the ruts. A smothered voice was heard, 
crying; “Quick 1 help!" It was Madeleine, who had just made a 
final effort. 

They all rushed to the work. The devotion of one man had given 
strength and courage to all The cart was lifted by twenty arms. 
Old Fauchelevent was safe. 

• Madeleine arose/ He was very pale, though dripping with sweat 
His clothes were tom and covered with mud. All wept. The old

wore on his face an indescribable expression of joyous and celes-

sequently did not receive much for her day’s work ; but that little 
was enough, the problem was solved ; she was earning her living. 


' VIII 

MADAME VICTTIRNIEN SPENDS TIIIETV FRANCS ON MORALITY 

When Fantine realised how she was living, she had a moment of 
joy. To live honestly by her own labour ; what a heavenly boon ! 
The taste for laI)our returned to her, in truth. She bought a mirror, 
delighted herself with the sight of her youth, her fine hair and her 
fine teeth, forgot many things, thought of nothing save Cosette and 
the possibilities of the future, and was almost happy. She hired a 
small room and furnished it on the credit of her future labour; a 
remnant of her habits of disorder. 

Not being aide to say that she was married, she took good care, 
as we have already intimated, not to si)eak of her little girl. 

At first, as we have seen, .she paid the Thenardiers punctually. 
As she only knew how to sign her name she was obliged to write 
through a public letter-writer. 

She wrote often ; that was noticed. They began to whisper in the 
women’s workshop that Fantine “wrote letters," and that “she had 
airs.’’ For prying into any human affairs, none are equal to those 
whom it doe.s’ not concern. “Why does this gentleman never come 
till dusk?” “Why does Mr. So-and-so never hang his key on the 
nail on Thur.sday?’’ “Why does he always take the by-streets?" 
“Why does madtime always leave her carriage before getting to the 
hou.se ?” “Why does she send to buy a (juire of writing-paper when 
she has her portfolio full of it?” etc. etc. There are persons who, 
to solve these enigma.s, which are moreover perfectly immaterial to 
them, spend more money, waste more time, and give themselves 
more trouble than would suffice for ten good deeds; and that 
gratuitously, and for the pleasure of it, without being paid for their 
curiosity in any other way than by curiosity. They will follow this 
man or that woman whole days, stand guard for hours at the cor- 
ners of the street, under the entrance of a passage-way, at night, 
in the cold and in the rain, bribe messengers, get hack-drivers and 
lackeys drunk, fee a chambermaid, or buy a porter. For what ? for 
nothing. Pure craving to see, to know, and to find out. Pure itching 
for scandal. And often these secrets made known, these mysteries 
published, these enigmas brought into the light of day, lead to catas- 
trophes, to duels, to failures, to the ruin of families, and make lives 
wretched, to the great joy of thow who have “dis&lt;»vered all” with- 
out any interest, and from pure instinct. A sad thinjy. 

Some people are malidota from the mere jnecessify of talkii^.

FAKTINE 151 

Fantine was thunderstruck. She could not leave the city; she 
was in debt for her lodging and her furniture. Fifty francs were 
not enough to clear off that debt. She faltered out some suppliant 
words. The overseer gave her to understand tliat she must leave 
the shop instantly. Fantine was moreover only a moderate worker. 
Overwhelmed with shame even more than with despair, she left 
the shop, and returned to her room. Her fault then was now known 
to all! 

She felt no strength to say a word. She was advised to see the 
mayor; she dared not. The mayor gave her fifty francs, because 
he was kind, and sent her away, because he was just. She bowed 
to that decree. 


IX 

StTCCESS OF MAPAME VICTUKNIEN 

TriK monk’s widow was then good for .something. 

Mon.sieur Madeleine had known nothing of all this. The.se are 
combinations of events of which life is full. It was Monsieur Made- 
leine's habit .scarcely ever to enter the women's workshop. 

He had placed at the head of this shop an old spinster whom the 
cure had recommendetl to him, and he had entire confidence in this 
overseer, a very respectable person, fimi, just, upright, full of that 
charity which consists in giving, hut not having to the same extent 
that charity which con.sists in understanding and pardoning. Mon- 
sieur Madeleine left everything to her. The best men ftre often com- 
pelled to delegate their authority. It wa.s in the exercise of this full 
power, and with the conviction that she was doing right, that the 
overseer had framed the indictment, trie&lt;l, condemned, and exe- 
cuted Fantine. 

As to tlie fifty francs, she had given them from a fund that Mon- 
sieur Madeleine had entrusted her with for alms-giving and aid to 
work-women, and of which she rendered no account. 

Fantine offered herself as a .servant in the neighbourhood; she 
went from one house to anotlier. Nobody wanted her. She could 
not leave the city. The second-hand dealer to whom she was in debt 
for her furniture, and such furniture! hod said to her: "If you go 
away, I will have you arrested as a thief.” The landlord, whenn she 
owed for rent, had said to her: "You are young and pretty) you can 
pay.” She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the 
dealer, returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only 
what was necessary, and found herself without work, without posi- 
tion, having nothing but her bed, and owing still abgiiljm^iiiJiidrBdr; 
francs. uiT/vi.

months she shook off her shame and went out as if there were noth- 
ing in the way. “It is all one to me,” said she. 

She went and came, holding her head up and wearing a bitter 
smile, and felt that slie was becoming .shameless. 

Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her pass her window, noticed 
the distress of “that creature,” thanks to her “put back to her place,” 
and congratulated herself. The malicious have a dark happiness. 

E.\cessive work fatigued Fanline, and the slight dry cough that 
she had increa.sed. She sometimes said to her neighbour. Margue- 
rite, “just feel how hot my hands are.” 

In the morning, however, when with an old broken comb she 
combed her fine hair which flowed down in silky waves, she en- 
joyed a moment of happiness.

KKSIJLTS OF THE SUCCESS 


SiiF. had been discharged towards the end of winter ; summer 
passed away, hut winter returned. Short «lays, less work. In winter 
there is no heat, no light, no noon, evening touches morning, there 
is fog, and mist, the window i.s frosted, and you cannot see clearly. 
The .sky is but the mouth of a cave. The whole day is the cave. The 
sun has the appearance of a pauper. Frightful season! Winter 
changes into stone the water of heaven and the heart of man. Her 
creditors harassed her. 

Famine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thenar- 
diers being poorly paid, were constantly writing letters to her, the 
contents of which disheartened her, while the postage was ruining 
her. One day they wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely 
de.stitute of clothing for the cold weather, that she needed a woollen 
skirt, and that her mother must send at least ten francs for that. 
She received the letter and crushed it in her hand for a whole day. 
In the evening she went into a barber’s shop at the comer of the 
street, and pulled out her comb. Her beautiful fair hair fell below 
her waist. 

“What beautiful hair !" exclaimed the barber. 

“How much will you give me for it ?" said she. 

“Ten francs.” 

“Cut it off.” . 

She bought a knit skirt and sent it to the Thinar^ers. , 

This skirt made the Thinafdiers furioiis. It w«a the money that 
they wanted. They S*ve the skirt to Epooiae. The poor lark still

harangue, in which were mingled slang for the rabble and jargon 
for the better sort. The puller of teeth saw this beautiful girl laugh- 
ing, and suddenly called out : “You have pretty teeth, you girl who 
are laughing there. If you will sell me your two incisors, I will give 
you a gold Napoleon for each of them.” 

“What is that ? What are my incisors ?” asked Fantine. 

“The incisors,” resumed the professor of dentistry, “are the front 
teeth, the two upper ones.” 

“How horrible !” cried Fantine. 

“Two Nepoleons!” grumbled a toothless old hag who stood by. 
“How lucky she is !” 

Fantine lied away and stopped her ears not to hear the shrill voice 
of the man who allied after her : “Consider, my beauty ! two Napo- 
leons ! how much good they will do you 1 1 f you have the courage for 
it, come this evening to the inn of the TiUac d'Argcjit; you will find 
me there.” 

Fantine returned home ; she was raving, and told the story to her 
good neighbour Marguerite: “Do you understand that? isn't he an 
abominalile ni;in? Wliy do the)'' let .such people go about the coun- 
try ? Pull out my two front teeth ! why, i should be horrible 1 The 
hair is bad enough, but the teeth ! Oh ! what a monster of a man 1 1 
would rather throw myself from the fifth story, head first, to the 
pavement ! He told me that he would be this evening at the Tiliae 
d' Argent.” 

“And what was it he offereil you ?” asked Marguerite. 

“Two Napoleons." 

“That is forty francs.” 

“Yes,” said Fantine, “that makes forty francs.” 

She became thoughtful and went about her work. In a quartet' 
of an hour she left her sewing and went to the stairs to read again 
the TluSnardiers’ letter. 

On her return she said to Marguerite, who was at work near her : 

“What does this mean, a miliary fever ? Do you know ?" 

“Yes,” answered the oUi woman, “it is a disease.” 

“Then it needs a good many drags ?” 

“Yes; terrible drugs.” 

“How does it come upon you ?” 

“It is a disease that comes in a moment.” 

“Does it attack children ?” 

"Children especially." 

“Do people tfic of it ?” 

“Very ou«i,” said Marguerite. 

Fantme withdrew and went once more to read over tlie letter on 
the stairs. 

In the evening she went out, and took the diureetkm of the Rue de 
Paris where the inns are.

thinking. She had a strange brilliancy in her eyes, and a constant 
pain in her shoulder near the top of her left shoulder-blade. She 
coughed a great deal. She hated Father Madeleine thoroughly, and 
never complained. She sewed seventeen hours a day ; but a prison 
contractor, who was working prisoners at a loss, suddenly cut down 
the price, and this reduced the day’s wages of free labourers to nine 
sous. Seventeen hours of work, and nine sous a day ! Her creditors 
were more pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer, who had 
taken back nearly all his furniture, was constantly saying to her: 
“When will you pay me, wench ?” 

Good God ! what did tliey want her to do? She felt herself hunted 
down, and something of the wild beast began to develop within her. 
About the same time, Thenardier wrote to her that really he had 
waited with too much genei-osity, and that he must have a hundred 
francs immediately, or else little Cosette, just convalescing after 
her severe sickness, would be turned out of doors into the cold and 
upon the highway, and that she would become what she could, and 
would perish if she must. “A hundred francs,” thought Fantine. 
“But where is there a place where one can earn a hundred sous a 
day?” 

“Come !” said she, “I w'ill .sell what is left.” 

The unfortunate creature became a woman of the town.

CIIRTSTUS NO.S I.IRERAVIT 

What is thi.s history of Fantine? It is society buying a slave. 

From whom ? From misery. 

From hunger, from cold, from loneliness, from abandonment, 
from privation. Melancholy barter. A soul for a bit of bread. Misery 
makes the ol'ier, society accepts. 

The holy law of Jesus Christ governs our civilisation, but it does 
not yet permeate it ; it is said that slavery has disappeared from 
European civilisation. This is a mistake. It still exists : but it weighs 
now only upon woman, -and it is called prostitution. 

It weighs upon woman, that is to say, upon grace, upon feeble- 
ness, upon beauty, upon maternity. This is not one of the least of 
man’s shames. 

^ At the stage of this mournful drama at which we have now ar- 
rived, Fantine has nothing left of what she had formerly been. She 
has become marble in becoming corrupted. Whoever touches her 
feels a chill. She goes her waySi she endures you and she knows you 
not ; she wears a dishonoured and severe face. life and social order- 
have spoken their last word to her. All that can happen to her has 
happened. She has endured alh bme (^, e^p«tieiK%d sil, suffered

Amonj^ these idlers there are some that are Uhc'i, &lt;M&gt;inr iliat aic 
bored, .some dreamers, and some jokers. 

In those days, ,-i dandy was nrade up of a larRe collar, a large 
cravat, a watch loaded with chains, three waistcoat v wori, our over 
the other, of different colours, the rc&lt;! and blue wiihm, a *l«ofi ohve- 
coloured coat with a fish-tail skirt, a double row of .iUer l*.itons 
alternating with one another and running up to ib« sHitulder. and 



FANTINE 15S&gt; 

pantaloons of a lighter olive, ornamented at the two seams with an 
indefinite, but always odd, number of ribs, varying from one to 
eleven, a limit which was never exceeded. Add to this, Blucher boots 
with little iron caps on the heel, a high-crowned and narrow- 
brimmed hat, hair bushed out, an enormous cane, and conversation 
spiced with the puns of Potier. Above all, spurs and moustaches. In 
those days, moustaches meant civilians, and spurs meant pedes- 
trians. 

The provincial dandy wore longer spurs and fiercer moustaches. 

It was the time of the war of the South American Republics 
against the King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Hats with 
narrow brims were Royalist, and were called Morillos ; the liberals 
, wore hats with wide brims which were called Bolivars. 

Eight or ten months after what has been related in the preceding 
pages, in the early part of January, 1823, one evening when it had 
been snowing, one of thc.se dandies, one of these idlers, a “well-in- 
tentioned" man, for he wore a morillo, very warmly wrapped in one 
of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in 
cold weather, was amusing himself with tormenting a creature who 
was walking back and forth before the window of the officers’ caf4 
iti a ball-dress, with her neck and shoulders bare, and flowers upon 
her head. Tlie dandy was smoking, for tliat was decidedly the fash- 
ion. 

Every time that the woman passed before him, he threw out at 
her, with a puff of smoke from his cigar, some remark which he 
thought was witty and pleasant as : “How ugly you are !’’ "Are you 
tiy'ing to hide?" “You have lost your teeth !’’ etc., etc. This gentle- 
man’s name was Monsieur Bamatabois. The woman, a rueful, bedi- 
zened spectre, who was walking backwards and forwards upon the 
snow, did not answer him, did not even look at him, but continued 
her walk in silence and with a dismal regularity that brought her 
under his sarcasm every five minutes, like the condemned soldier 
who at stated periods returns under the rods. This failure to secure 
attention doubtless piqued the loafer, who, taking advantage of the 
moment when she turned, came up liehind her with a stealthy step 
and stifling his laughter stooped down, seized a handful of snow 
from the side walk, and threw it hastily into her back between her 
naked shoulders. The girl roared with rage, turned, bounded lik» a 
panther, and rushed upon the man, burying her nails in his face, and 
using the most frightful words that ever fell from the off-scburii^ 
of a guard-house. These insults were thrown out in a voice rottglt- 
ened oy brandy, from a hidwms mouth which ladced the two frcMOt 
teeth. It was Fantine, , 

At the noise which this made, tibe officers cs^ oitl of the caf^ 
a crowd gathered, and a latige drde was laughing, jeeiing 

and around tins eentre ol of two

the more he revolted at it. It was clear that he had seen a crime com- 
mitted. He had seen, there in the street, society repi’esented by a 
property holder and an elector, insulted and attacked by a creature 
who was an outlaw and an outcast. A prostitute had assaulted a 
citizen. He, Javert, had seen that himself. He wrote in silence. 

When he had finished, he signed his name, folded the paper, and 
handed it to the sergeant of the guard, saying : “Take three men, 
and carry this girl to jail.” Then turning to l^antine : “You are in for 
six months.” 

The hapless woman shuddered. 

“Six months ! six months in prison !” cried she. “Six months to 
earn seven sous a day ! but what will become of Cosette ! my (laugh- 
ter 1 my^ daughter ! Why, I still owe more than a hundred francs to 
the Th(5nardiers, Monsieur Inspeclor, do you know that ?” 

She dragged herself along on the floor, dirtied by the muddy boots 
of all these men, without rising, clasping her hands, and moving 
rapidly on her knees. 

“Monsieur Javert,” said she, “I beg your pity. I assure you that 
I was not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would 
have seen, I swear to you by the good God that I was not in the 
wrong. That gentleman, whom I do not know, threw snow in my 
hack. Have they the right to throw snow into our backs when we 
are going along quietly like that without doing any harm to any- 
liody ? That made me wild. I am not very well, you seel and then 
he had already been saying things to me for some time. ‘You are 
homely !' ‘You have no teeth !’ I know too well that I have lost my 
teeth. I did not do anything; I thought: ‘He is a gentleman who is 
amusing himself.’ I was not immodest with him, 1 did not speak to 
him. It was then that he threw the snow at me. Monsieur Javert, my 
good Monsieur Inspector I was there no one there who saw it and 
can tell you tliat this is true ! I perhaps did wrong to get angry. You 
know, at the first moment, we cannot master ourselves. We are ex- 
citable, And t|ien, to have something so cold thrown into your bade 
when you are not expecting it. I did wrong to spoil the gentleman’s 
hat. Why has he gone away? I would ask his pardon. Oh 1 1 would 
beg his ^rdon. Have pity on me now this once, Monsieur Javert. 
Stop, you don’t know how it is, in the prisons they only earn seven 
sous; that is not the fault of the government, but they earn seven 
sous, and just think that I have a hundred franca to pay, or else they 
will turn away ray little one. O my God 1 1 cannot have hee witih tn*.

SO monstrous that in his most daring suppositions he would have 
thought it sacrilege to believe it possible. On the other hand, deep 
down in his thought, he dimly brought into hideous association what 
this wonian was and what this mayor might be, and then he per- 
ceived with horror something indescribably simple in this prodig- 
ious assault. But when he saw this mayor, this magistrate, wipe his 
face quietly and say : set this woman at liberty, he was stupefied 
with amazement; thought and speech alike failed him; the sum of 

f possible astonishment had been overpassed. He remained speech- 
ess. 

The mayor’s words were not less strange a blow to Fantine. She 
raised her bare arm and clung to the damper of the stove as if she 
were staggered. Meanwhile she looked all around and began to talk 
in a low voice, as if speaking to herself : 

“At liberty! the}^ let me go! I am not to go to prison for six 
months I Who was it said that ? It is not possible that anybody said 
that. 1 misunderstood. That cannot be thi.s monster of a mayor ! 
Was it you, my good Monsieur javert, who told them to set me at 
liberty? Oh ! look now ! I will tell you and you will let me go. This 
monster of a mayor, this old whelp of a mayor, he is the cause of all 
this. Think of it, Monsieur Javert, he turned me away I on account 
of a parcel of beggars who told stories in the workshop. Was not 
that horrible ! To turn away a poor girl who does her work honestly. 
Since that I could_ not earn enough, and all the wretchedness has 
come. To begin with, there is a change that you gentlemen of the 
police ought to make — that is, to stop prison contractors from 
wronging poor people. T will tell you how it is; listen. You earn 
twelve sous at shirt making, that falls to nine sous, not enough to 
live. Then we must do what we can. For me, I had my little Cosette, 
and I had to l&gt;e a bad woman. You sec now that it is this beggar of 
a mayor who has done all this, and then, I did stamp on the hat of 
this gentleman in front of the officers’ caf^. But he, he had spoiled 
my whole dress with the snow. We women, we have only one silk 
dress, for evening. See you, I have never meant to do wrong, in 
truth, Monsieur Javert, and I see ever 3 nwhere much worse women 
than I am who are much more fortunate, ph. Monsieur Javert, it is 
you who said that they must let me go, is it not ? Go and inquire, 
speak to my landlord ; 1 pay my rent, and he will surely tell you tlxat 
I am honest. Oh dear, I l«ig your pardon, I have touched — | did not 
know it — the damper of the stove, and it smokes.” 

Monsieur Madeleine listened with profound attention. While she 
was talking, he had fumbled in his waistcoat, had taken out his 
purse and opened it It was empty. He had put it back into his 
pocket He said to Fantine : 

"How much did you say that you owed?" 

Fantine, who had only lookea at Javert, twa#d towards him:

“I/* said Madeleine. 



F A N T I N E 165 

At the words of Javert, Funtine had trembled and dropped the 
latch, as a thief who is caught, drops what he has stolen. When 
Madeleine spoke, she turned, and from that moment, without say- 
ing a word, without even daring to breathe freely, she looked by 
turns from Madeleine to Javert and from Javert to Madeleine, as 
the one or the other was speaking. 

It was dear that Javert must have been, as they say, "thrown off 
his balance,” or he would not have allowed himself to address the 
sergeant as he &lt;lid, after the direction of the ma}’or to set Fantine 
at liberty. Had he forgotten the presence of the mayor? Had he 
finally d'edded within himself that it was impossible for "an au- 
thority" to give such an onler, and th.-it very certainly the mayor 
must have said one thing when he meant another? Or, in view of 
the enormities which he had witnessed for the last two hours, did 
he say to himself that it was necessary to revert to extreme meas* 
ures, that it was necessary for the little to make itself great, for the 
detective to transform hiin.self into a magistrate, for the policeman 
to become a judge, and tliat in this fearful e.xtremity, order, law, 
mor.ality, government, society as a whole, were personified in him, 
Javert ? 

However this might be, wiien Monsieur Matleleine immounced 
that / which we have just heard, the in.spedor of police, Javert, 
turned towards the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, a desperate 
look, his wlwle Ixidy agitated with an imperceptible trenjor, and, 
an unheard-of thing, said to him, with a downcast look, but a firm, 
voice : 

“Monsieur Mayor, that cannot be done.” 

"Why?” said Monsieur Madeleine. 

"Tlu.s wretched vvt»man has insulted a citizen.” 

"Inspeelor Javert," replied Monsieur Madeleine, in .1 conciliating 
and calm tone, ''listen, \'tju are an honest man, aitd 1 have no ob- 
jection to explain my.self to you. Tiie truth i.s tliis. 1 w'as passing 
through tlie siiuare when you arrested tliis woman ; there wa.s a 
crowd still there; I learned the circunustances ; 1 know all about it; 
it is the citizen who was in the wrong, ami who, by a faitltful jioiice, 
would have !»een arrested." 

Javert went on ; 

"This wretch has just insulted Monsieur the Mayor.” 

"That costcerns me," said Monsieur Madeleine, "The insult to 
me rests with myself, perhaps, I can do wliat I please about it." 

“I lieg Monsieur the Mayor's pardon. The insult rests not with 
him. it rests with justice.’* ’ 

"Ins|»ctor Javert," replied Monsieur Madeleine, "the highest 
justice is conscience. I have heard this woman. I know what I am

“Then content yourself with ul&gt;eying.“ 

“I obey my duty. My duty requires that this \v»auan spend six

“Listen to this. She shall not a day/’ 

At these decisive words, Javert: had the' Inddiiess !&lt;■'* i,h^

“I am very sorry to resist Monsiettr the ..Xliivor ; it i-. die Iii'ni

their hands her liheriy, her life, her intd. her rhifd : one nf ihrse 
men w’'as drawing lier to the side of darkness, the other Ira*hng 
her towards the light, In this contest, seen with diiitinion thnnigh 
the magnifving fKm^er of fright, these two men had afifiearrit la her 
like two giants; one s|Hike as her demon, the tnher as her gmid 



F A N T I N E 167 

angel. The angel had vanquished the demon, and the thought of it 
made her shudder from head to foot; this angel, this deliverer, 
was precisely the man whom she abhorred, this mayor whom she 
had so long considered as the author of all her woes, this Made- 
leine ! and at the very moment when she had insulted him in a hide- 
ous fashion, he had saved her ! Had she then been deceived ? Ought 
she then to change her whole heart ? She did not know, she trembled. 
She listened with dismay, she looked around with alarm, and at 
each word that Monsieur Madeleine uttered, she felt the fearful 
darkness of her hatred melt within and flow away, while there was 
born in her heart an indescribable and unspeakable warmth of joy, 
of confidence, and of love. 

When Javert was gone. Monsieur Madeleine turned towards her, 
and said to her, speaking .slowly and with difficulty, like a man who 
is struggling that he may not weep : 

"I have hprd you. I knew nothing of what you have said. I be- 
lieve that it is true. I did not even know that you had left my work- 
shop. Why did you not apply to me ? But now : I will pay your debts, 
1 will have your child come to you, or you shall go to her. You shall 
live here, at Paris, or where you will. I take charge of your child 
and you. You shall do no more work, if you do not wish to. I will 
give you all the money that you need. You shall again become hon- 
est in again becoming happy. More than that, listen. I declare to you 
from this moment, if all is as you say, and I do not doubt it, that you 
have never ceased to be virtuous and holy before God. Oh, poor 
woman 1" 

This was more than poor Fantine could bear. To have Cosette ! 
to leave this infamous life! to live free, rich, happy, honest, with 
Cosette ! to see suddenly spring up in the midst of her misery all 
these realities of paradise 1 She looked as if she were stupefied at the 
man who was speaking to her, and could only pour out two or three 
sobs : ‘‘Oh ! oh f oh !’’ Her limbs gave way, she threw herself on her 
knees before Monsieur Madeline, and, before he could prevent it, 
he felt that she had seized his hand and carried it to her lips. 

Then she fainted.

168 



li" A N T I N E 169 

He sighed deeply ; but she smiled with this sublime smile from 
which two tcetli were gone. 

That same night, Javert wrote a letter. Next morning he carried 

this letter himself to the post-office of M sur M- — . It was 

directed to Paiis and boi-e this address: “To Monsieur Chabouillet, 
Secretary of Monsieur the Pi'efect of Police.” 

As the affair of the Bureau of Police had l)een noised about, the 
postmistress.and some others who saw the letter before it was sent, 
and who recognized Javert’s handwriting in the address, thought 
he was sending in his resignation. Monsieur Madeleine wrote im- 
mediately to the Thennreliers. Fantine owed them a hundred and 
twenty francs. He .sent them three hundred francs, telling them to 

pay themselves out of it, and bring the child at once to M sur 

M , where her mother, who was sick, wanted her. 

This a.stonished Thenardier. 

“Tlie Devil !” he said to his wife, “we won't let go of the child. 

: It may be that this lark will become a milch cow. I guess some silly 
i fellow had been .smitten by the mother.” 

He replied by a liill of fiye hun’dred and some odd fx-ancs care- 
fully drawn up. In this bill figured two incontestable items for up- 
wards of thi'ee hundred francs, one of a physician and the other of 
an apothecary who had attendetl and supplied Eponine and Azelma 
during two long illnesses. Cosette, as we have said, had not been ill. 
This wa.s only a slight substitution of name.s. Thenardier wrote at 
the bottom of the bill : “Received on account three hundred francs.” 

Monsieur Matleleine immediately sent three hundred francs 
more, and wrote: “Make ha.ste to bring Cosette.” 

“Christy !" said I'henardier, “we won't let go of the girl.” 

Meanwhile Fantine had not recovered. She still remained in the 
infirmary. 

It was not without some rcpugixance, at first, that the sisters re- 
ceived and cared for “this girl.” He who has seen the bas-reliefs at 
Rheims will recall the distension of the lower lip of the wise virgins 
beholding the foolish virgins. This ancient contempt of vestals for 
less fortunate women is one of the deepest instincts of womanly 
dignity ; the shters, had experienced it with the intensification of 
Religion. Rut in a few days Fantine had disarmed them. The moth- 
erly tenderness within her, with her soft and touchmjg words,/ 
moved them. One day the sisters heard her sajrun her delirium: **I 
have been a sinner, but when I shall have my ^Ud with ttm, that 
will mean that God has pardoned me. While I wlubad I would not 
have had my Cosette with me ; I could not have home her sad and 
surprised looks. It was for her I sinned, and that is why God for- 
gives me. I shall fee! this benediction when Cosette ^oomes. I shall 
gaae upon her; the sight of her mnooeac^ will do me good, She

knows nothing of it all. She is an angel, you see, my sisiors. At her 

age the wings have not yet fallen.” 

Monsieur Madeleine came to see her twifo a day, and at v;u h 
visit she asked him : 

"Shall I see my Cosette sotm?” 

He answered : 

“Perhaps to-morrow. I expect her every jiiomcut.'' 

And the mother’s pale face would hriglileti. 

“Ah!” she would say, "how liapity 1 shall he.”

“Yes.” 

“Weil then, make haste to brini; her." 

Monsieur Maileleiiie gave a slrndtirr,

HOW JEAN CAN BECOME CHAMP 

One morning Monsieur Madeleine was in his office arranging for 
some pressing business of the mayoralty, in case he should decide 
to go to Montfenneil himself, when he was informed that Javert, 
the inspector of police, wished to siwak with him. On hearing 
this name spoken. Monsieur Madeleine could not repress a dis- 
agreeable impression. Since the affair of the Bureau of Police, 
Javert had more than ever avoided him, and Monsieur Madeleine 
had not seen him at all. 

“Let him come in,” said he. 

Javert entered. 

Monsieur Madeleine remained seated near the fire, looking over 
a bundle of papers uj)on which he was making notes, and which 
contained the returns of tlie police patrol, l ie &lt;Hd not disturb him- 
self nt all for Javert : lie could not Imt think of poor Famine, and it 
was fitting tluit he .should receive him very coldly. 

. Javert respectfully saluted the mayor, who had his back towards 
him. I'he muyim did not look up. but continued to malce notes on 
the papers. 

Javert advanced a few steps, and paused without breaking 
silence. 

A physiognomist, ha&lt;l he liwn familiar with Javert’.s face, had 
he made a studj^ for years of this savage in the service of civilisa- 
tion, this odtl nil.xture of the Roman, Sj^artan, monk and corporal, 
this spy, incapable of a lie, this virgin iletective — a physiognomist, 
had he knov^n his secret and inveterate aversion for Monsieur 
Madeleine, his contest with the mayor on the subject of Fantine, 
and had he seen Javert at that moment, would have said: “What 
has hnppenetl to him ?’’ 

It was evident to any one who had known this conscientious, 
straight-forward, clear, sincere,, upright, austere, fierce man, that 
Javert ha&lt;i suffered some great interior commotion. There was 
nothing in his mind that was not depicted on his face. He was, like 
all violent people, subject to sudden changes. Never had his face 
been stranger or more startling. On entering, he had bowed before 
Monsieur Madeleine with a look in which was neither rancour, 
anger, nor defiance ; he paused some steps behind the mayor’s diair, 
and was now standing tn a soldierly attitude with the natural, cold 
rudeness of a man who was never kind, but has ai#aya beeoi patient ; 
he waited without speaking a word or making a motioo, hi genuine 
humility and tranquil resi^tion, until it shendd fdease 
the Mayor to turn towards him, calm, serious, baft k hand, and 
eyes cast down with an expresricn behmmtjmt nf a soldier before 



172 L E S M. I S fe R A K h K S 

his officer and a prisoner l)cfore his Al! the feelnii: as wcl! 

as all the remembrances which wc sliuuM have hu:i^ to 

have, disappeared. Nothing was left upon this fact% sinsph* and uu* 

oenetrable as granite, except a gloomy sadness, I iis wisde ptm -un 

expi'essed abasement and lirmncss, an ithlescribably c»‘uru;,;^/MU,s 

dejection. 

At last the mayor kid down his pen and ttirned | sai 1 n min ! : 
*'Well, what is it? What is tlie matter, Javert ; 

Javert remained silent a moment as if eti!leron;i; hnn r!i ; tljrtt 
raised his voice witli a sad solemnity wliieh did iu&lt;, luivo-un . rx- 
clude simplicity: ‘‘There has been a crimina! lut *o»nani*!rdi, Mt 
sieur Mayor/’ 

^ What act?" 

''An inferior agent of the government lias b«a*n w.nttim: in vr- 
spect to a magistrate, in tlie gravest manmvr. t e* Jiur, as i . mv din&gt;\ 
to bring the fact to your knowledge.’’ 

'Who is this agent?" asked Monsieur Mailelriue, 

"I," said Javert 
, "You?" 

"L" 

"And who is the. magistrate w!i»5 has to ciiniplaiu of this ajpan ?’* 
"You, Monsieur Ma\'or/‘ 

Monsieur Madeleine straightenetl hiue.rh in hi% rlaut. lavert 
continued, with serious looks and evi^s still east dp'^' m. 

"Monsieur Mayor, 1 come tt» iwk vmu tn be sh lies I as tv i toinke 
charges and procure my &lt;UsmissaI." 

Monsieur Madeleine, amazed, ojiened hk mninJi. lavrst 
rupted him : 

"You will say that 1 might tender my resign, niorn bm tlxo t ; mA 
enough* To resign is honourable; 1 liave d»»ne vv tMog. 1 mu/J t In* 
punished. I mu.st be dismisseti" 

And after a pause he added : 

"Monsieur Mayor, you were severe me the tiffjer dav. nn 
justly. Be justly so to-day." 

"Ah, indeed! why? What is all Uliat dMr , o all 

mean? What Is the criminal act committed bv wnt ag.on .f me? 
What have you done to me? Ihnv liave voii wrf*tigrd mr Vnu 
accuse yourself ; do vfiu wisli to be reliever! r" 

"Dismissed*" said'javert. 

"Dismissed it is then. It is very strange, f tlo nnl imder' l.md voii," 
"You will understand, Monsieur Mayor " javeii sighed drrpiv, 
and continued sldly and coldly: 

"Monsieur Mayor, six weeks agti, after that serne aknit that 
girl, I was enraged and I detumneed vrni/* 

"Denounced me ?" 

"To the Prefecture of Police at Paris,*'' 



FAN TINE 173 

Monsieur Madeleine, who did not laugh much oftener than Ja- 
vert, began to laugh : 

“As a mayor having encroached upon the police ?” 

“As a former convict.” 

The mayor became livid. 

Javert, who had not raised his eyes, continued : 

“I believed it. For a long while I had had suspicions. A resem- 
blance, information you obtained at Faverollcs, your immense 
strength ; the affair of old Fauchelevent ; your skill as a marksman ; 
your leg which drags a little — and in fact I don’t know what other 
stupidities ; but at last I took you for a man named Jean Valjean.” 

“Named what? How did you call that name?” 

“Jean Valjean. He was a convict I saw twenty years ago, when I 
was adjutant of the galley guard at Toulon. After leaving the gal- 
leys this Valjean, it appears, robbed a bishop’s palace, then he com- 
mitted another I'obbery with weapons in his hands, in a highway, on 
a little Savoyard. I''or eight years his whereabouts have been un- 
known, and search has been made for him. I fancieii — in short, I 
have done this thing. Anger determined me, ami I denounced you 
to the prefect.” 

M. Madeleine, who had taken up the file of papers again, a few 
moments before,- said with a tone of perfect indifference: "And 
what an.swer &lt;lid you get ?” 

“That 1 was crazy.” 

“Well !” 

“Well ; they were right.” 

“It is fortunate that you think so !” 

“It must be so, for the real Jean Valjean has been found.” 

The paper that M. Madeleine hehl fell from his hand; he raised 
his head, looked steadily at Javert, and said in an inexpressible 
tone: 

“Ah f” 

Javert continued : 

“I will tell you how it Ls, Monsieur Mayor. There was, it appears, 
in the country, near Aill^-le-Haut Clocher, a simple sort of fellow 
who was called Father Champmatbieu. He was very poor. Nobody 
paid any attention to him. Such folks live, one hardly knows how. 
Finally, this last fall, Father Champmathieu was arrested for steal- 
ing cider apples from , but that is of no consequence. There was 

a tlieft, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. Our Champmathieu 
was arrested ; he had even then a branch of an apple-tree in his 
hand. The rogue was caged. So far, it was nothing more than a 
itentiary matter. But here comes in the hand of Providrace. ^e 
jail being in a bad condition* the police justice thought it best to 
take him to Arras, where the prison of the department is. In this 
.prison at Arras there was a former comn« named Brevet, who is

' Former convict. 



, F A i.'T T I N E 17i' 

“Monsieur Mayor, truth is truth. I am sorry for it, but that man 
is Jean Valjean. I recognised him ahso.” 

Monsieur Madeleine said in a very low voice : 

“Are you sure ?” 

Javert began to laugh with the suppressed laugh which indicates 
profound conviction. 

“H’m, sure!” 

He remained a moment in thought, mechanically taking up 
pinches of the powdered wood used to dry ink, from the box on 
the table, and then added : 

“And now that I see the real Jean Valjean, I do not understand 
how I ever could have believed anything else. I beg your pardon, 
Monsieur Mayor." 

_ In uttering these serious_ and supplicating words to him, who 
isix weeks before had humiliated him before the entire guard, and 
had said_ “Retire !" Javert, this haughty man, was unconsciously 
full of simplicity and dignity. Monsieur Madeleine answered his 
reque.st, by this abrupt question : 

“And what did the man say?” 

“Oh, bless me ! Monsieur Mayor, the affair is a bad one. If it is 
Jean Valjean, it, is a second offence. To climb a wall, break a 
branch, and take apples, for a child is only a trespass ; for a man it is 
a misdemeanor ; for a convict it is a crime. Scaling a wall and tlieft 
includes everything. It is not a case for a police court, but for the 
assize-s. It is not a few days’ imprisonment, but the galleys for life. 
And then there is the affair of the little Savoyard, who I hope 
will be found. The devil ! There is something to struggle against, 
is there not? There would be for anyljody but Jean Valjean. But 
Jean Valjean is a sly fellow. And that is just where I recognise 
him. Anylxidy else would know that he was in a hot place, and 
would rave and cry out, as the tea-kettle sings on the fire ; he would 
say that he was not Jean Valjean, et cetera. But this man pretends 
not to understand, he says : ‘I am Champmathieu : I have no more to 
say.' He puts on an appearance of astonishment ; he plays the brute. 
Oh, the rascal is cunning ! But it is all the same, there is the evidence. 
Four persons have recognissed him, and the old villain will be con- 
demned. It has been taken to the assizes at Arras. I am going to 
testify. I have been summoned.” 

Monsieur Madeleine had turned again to his desk, and was 
quietly looking over his papers, reading and writing alternately, 
like a man pressed with business. He turned again towards Javert ; 

‘‘That will do, Javert. Indeed all these details inter«^ me very 
little. We are wasting time, and we have urgent business, Javert ; 
go at once to the house of the good wonian Buseaupied, who sells 
herbs at the comer of Rue Saint Saulve; tell her to make her com- 
c^inst the carman Pierre Qi«snelto^. Hfe is a brutal fellow.

your person, I, who am the agent of authority. If one of .my subordi- 
nates had done what I have, I would have pronounced him un- 
worthy of the service, and sent him away. Well, listen a moment, 
Monsieur Mayor; I have often been severe in my life towards 
others. It was just. I did right. Now if I were not severe towards 
myself, all I have justly done would become inju-stice. Should I 
spare myself more than others? No. What! if I should be prompt 
only to punish others and not myself, I should be a wretch indeed! 
They who say : ‘That Idackguard, Javert,’ would be right. Monsieur 
Mayor, I do not wish you to treat me with kindnesk Your kind- 
ness, when it was for others, enraged me ; I do not wish it for my- 
self. That kiiKlncsH which consists in '{lefending a woman of the 
town against a citizen, a police agent again.st the mayor, the inferior 
against the superior, that is what I call ill-judged kindness. Such 
kindness disorganizes society. Good God, it is easy to be kind, the 
difficulty is to he just. Had you been wliat 1 thought, I should not 
have been kind to you; not 1. You would have seen, Monsieur 
Mayor. 1 ought to treat my. self as I woukl treat anybody else. When 
I put down malefactors, when I rigorously brought up offenders, I 
often sai&lt;l to myself : ‘You, if you ever trip ; if ever I catch you do- 
ing wrong, look out!’ I have tripped, I have caught myself doing 
wrong. So much the worse ! 1 must be .sent away, broken, dismissed, 
that is right. I have hands : I can till the ground. It is all the same to 
me_. Monsieur Mayor, the good of the service demands an example. 
I simply ask the dismissal of In.sjKxtor Javert.” 

All this wa.s sai&lt;i iii a tone of proud humility, a desperate and 
resolute tone, which gave an indescribably whimsical grandeur to 
this oddly honest man. 

“We will see,” said Monsieur Madeleine. 

And be held out his hand to him. 

Javert started hack, and said fiercely .* 

“Pardon, Monsieur Mayor, that should not be. A mayor does not 
give his hand to a spy." 

He added between his teeth : 

“Spy, yes; from the moment I abused the power of my position, 
I have hecn nothing better than a spy !” 

Then he bowed profoundly, and went towards the door. 

There he turned around : his eyes yet downcast. 

“Monisieur Mayor, I will continue in the service until I am 
relieved.” 

He went out. Monsieur Madeleine sat musing, listening to his 
firm and resolute step as it died away along the txirrjidor.

SO much liberty with so much servitude. “Her only convent shall 
be the house of sickness ; her only cell, a hired lodging ; her cliapel 
the parish church ; her cloister the sti'eets of the city, or the wards 
of the hospital ; her only wall obedience ; her grate the fear of God ; 
her veil modesty.” This ideal was made alive in Sister Simplice. 
No one could have told Sister Simplice’s age ; she had never been 
young, and seemed as if she never should be old. She was a person 
— we dare not say a woman — gentle, austere, companionable, cold, 
and who had never told a He. She was so gentle that she appeared 
fragile ; but on tlie contrary she was more enduring than granite. 
She touched the unfortunate with charming fingers, delicate and 
pui'e. There was, so to say, silence in her speech ; she said just what 
was necessary, and she had a tone of voice which would at the same 
time have edified a confessional, and enchanted a drawing-i’oom. 
This delicacy accommodated it. self to the serge dress, finding in its 
harsh touch a continual reminder of Heaven and of God. Let us 
dwell upon one circumstance. Never to have lied, never to have 
spoken, for any pui’pose whatever, even carelessly, a single word 
which was not the truth, the .sacred truth, was the distinctive trait 
of Sister SimpUce ; it was the mark of her virtue. She was almost 
celebrated in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity. The 
Ahbe Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf mute, 
Massieu. Sincere and pure as we may be, we all have the mark of 
some little He upon our truthfulness. She had none. A little lie, an 
innocent lie, can such a thing exist ?. To lie is the absolute of evil. To 
lie a little is not possilde ; he who lies, lies a whole lie ; lying is the 
very face of the demon. Satan has two names ; he is called Satan, 
and he is called the Liar. Such were her thoughts. And as she 
thought, she practised. From this resulted that whiteness of which 
we have spoken, a whiteness that covered with its radiance even 
her lips and her eyes. Her smile was white, her look was white. 
There was not a spider’s web, not a speck of dust upon the glass of 
that conscience, when she took the vows of St. Vincent de Paul, 
she had taken the name of Simplice by especial choice. Simplice of 
Sicily, it is well known, is that saint who preferred to have both 
her tireasts torn out rather than answer, having been born at Syra- 
cuse, that she was born at Segesta, a lie which would have saved her. 
This patron saint was fitting for this soul. 

Sister Simplice, on entering the order, had two faults of which 
she corrected herself gradually ; she had had a taste for delicacies, 
and loved to receive Tetters. Now she read nothing but a prayer- 
book in large type at^ in Latin. She did not understand Latin, but 
she understood the book. . ^ 

The pious wtanan had conceived an a€ecti&lt;m for Fantine, per- 
ceiving in her probably $ofiat Uttent viitue, and had devoted herself 
almost ewduiivdy to her care.

'“Master Scaufflaire,” he asked, “have you a good horse ?” 

“Monsieur Mayor,” said the Fleming, “all my horses are good. 
What do you understand by a good horse ?” 

“I understand a horse that dan go twenty leagues in a day.” 

“The devil !” said the Fleming, “twenty leagues !” 

“Yes.” 

“Befoi-e a chaise?” 

“Yes.” 

“And how long will he rest after the journey?” 

“He must be able to start again the next day in case of need.” 

“To do the same thing again ?” 

“Yes.” 

“The devil ! and it is twenty leagues ?” 

Monsieur Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he 
had pencilled the figures. He showed them to the Fleming. They 
were the figures, S, 6, 8j4- 

“You see,” said he. “Total, nineteen and a half, that is to say, 
twenty leagues.” 

“Monsieur Mayor,” resumed the Fleming, “I have just what you 
want. My little white hoi-se, you must have seen him sometimes 
passing; he is a little beast from Bas-Boulonnais. He is full of fire. 
They tried at first to make a saddle horse of him. Bah ! he kicked, he 
threw everybody off. They thought he was vicious, they didn’t know 
what to do. I bought him. I put him before a chaise ; Monsieur, that 
is what he wanted ; he is as gentle as a ^rl, he goes like the wind. 
But, for example, it won’t do to get on his back. It’s not his idea to 
be a saddle horse. Everybody has his peculiar ambition. To draw, 
but not to carry : we must believe that he has said that to himself.” 

■ “And he will make the trip?” 

“Your twenty leagues, all the way at a full trot, and in less than 
eight hours. But 'there are some conditions.” 

“Name them.” 

“First, you must let him breathe an hour when you are half way ; 
he will eat, and somebody must be by while he eats to prevent the 
tavern boy from stealing his oats ; for I have noticed that at taverns, 
oats are oftener drunk by the stable boys than eaten by the horses.” 

“Somebody shall be there.” 

“Secondly — ^is the chaise for Monsieur the Mayor?”. 

“Yes." 

“Monsieur the Mayor knows how to drive?” 

"Yes.” ■ ■ 

"Well, Monsieur the Mayor will travel alone and without bag- 
gage, so as not to overload the horse.'" 

“But.Monriteur the bdayor, -having ■«d',os»a.'t^th. Mm, wHl bt 
ob%ed |o, take the trouble of se«ng to the oats himself ”

'^So said/’

a penny less, and the fodder of the beast at the exi&gt;cn,st: of Monsieur 
the Mayor/' 

Monsieur Madeleine took three Napoleons from his |:)urse and 
laid them on the table. 

'^There is two days, in advance.” 

^Tourthly, for such a trip, a chaise would he too heavy; that 
would tire the horse. Monsieur the Mayor must consent U) travel in 
a little tilbuiy that I hav'^ ” 

''I consent to that.” 

^‘It is light, but it is open,” 

^It is all the same to me.” 

'*Has Monsieur the Mayor rellected that it is winter r” 

Monsieur Madeleine did not an.swer ; the Fleming vverd; on : 

'That it is very cold ?” 

Monsieur Madeleine kept silence. 

Master Scaufflaire continued ; 

'That it may rain ?” 

Monsieur Madeleine raised his head and said : 

'*The horse and the till)ury will he before my door to-^morrnvv at 
half-past four in the morning.” 

“That is undenstood, Monsieur .May&lt;u*/’ answered Seautdaire, 
then scratching a stain on the top ui the table with hi;; t !uim! » naif » he 
resumed with that careless air that Flemings so well kianv hnw to 
associate with their shrewdness ; 

“Why, I have just thought of it ! Monsieur the Miw ur ftaN m tnld 
me where he is going. Where is .Monsieur the Mayur w.* r" 

He had thought of notliing else since tin* liegitmin;: ai xhv .over- 
sation, but without knowing whj% he had not dared tu ad; tlie 
tion. 

“Has w)ur fon’Iegs?” said Mondenr Madeh i;;e. 

'‘Yes, Momsieur Mayor. You will hold turn up a lit ilr goun; d- nvu- 
hill. Is there much downhill lietween here and whne vruraiv eo*. 

“Don't forget to he at my dc*or precisely at half pad fmir in tlie 
morning, ” answered Monsieur Madeleine, and he wem f*m. 

The Fleming was left “dumli-foimded.” as he said hnuself sraue 
tune afterwards. 

The mayor had been gone two or three tnimiles. when the dM^r 
again opened ; it was the mayor. 

He had the same impassive and alisem- minded air as ever. 

Monsieur Scmfllaire/* said he, “at what sum tlo you valur t!te

“The one drawing the other, Monsieur Mayor,” said the Flem- 
ing with a loud laugh. . 

“As you like. How much ?” 

“Does Monsieur the Mayor wish to buy them ?” 

“No, but at all events I wish to guarantee them to you. On niy 
return you can give me back the amount. At how much do you value 
horse and chaise ?’’ 

“Five hundred francs, Monsieur Mayor!” 

“Here it is.” 

Monsieur Madeleine placed a banknote on the table, then went 
out, and thi.s time did not return. 

Ma.ster Scaufllaire regretted terribly that he had not .said a thous- 
and francs. In fact, the horse and tilbury, in the lump, were worth 
a hundred crown.s. 

The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. Where 
the deuce could the mayor be going ? They talked it over. “He is go- 
ing to-Paris," said the wife. “I don’t believe it," sjiid the husl&gt;and. 
Monsieur Madeleine had forgotten the paper on which he had 
marked the fif'ures, and left it on the mantel. The Fleming seized 
it and studieil it. Five, six, eight and a hal f ? this must mean the re- 
lays of the iK&gt;st. He turned to his wife: “I have found it out.” 
“How ?” "It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to 
Saint Pol, 'eight and a half from Saint Pol to Arras. He is going to 
Arras.” 

Meanwhile Monsieur Madeleine had reached home. To return 
from Master Scaufllaire’s he had taken a longer road, as if the door 
of the parsonage were a temptation to him, and he wished to avoid 
it. He went up to his room, and shut himself in, which was nothing 
remarkable, for he usually went to bed early. However, the jan- 
itress of the factory, who was at the same time Monsieur Madel- 
eine’s only servant, observed that his light was out at half-past 
eight, afid she mentioned it to the cashier who came in, adding : 

“Is Monsieur the Mayor sick ? I thought that his manner wan a 
little singular.” 

The cashier occupied a room situated exactly beneath Monsieur 
Madeleine’s. He paid no attention to the portre-ss’s words, went 
to bed, and went to sleep. Towards midnight he suddenly awoke ; ha 
|had heard, in his sleep, a noise overhead. He listened. It was a

We have but little to add to what the reader already knows, con- 
cerning what had happened to Jean Valjean, since his adventure 
with Petit Gervais. From that moment, we have .seen, he was an- 
other man. What the bi.shop had desired to do with him, that he had 
executed. It was more than a transformation — it was a transheura- 
tion. 

lie succeeded in escapiiij? from sight, sold the bishop’s silver, 
keeping only the candlesticks as souvenirs, glided quietly from city 

to city across France, came to M sur M , conceived the idea 

tlrat we have described, accomplished what we have related, gained 
the point of making himself unas.sailal)lc and inaccessible, and 

thence forward, estai)Hshe&lt;l at M sur M— — , hapjiy tcj feel his 

conscience saddened by his past, and the last half of his cxi.stenci, 
giving the lie to the first, he lived juiacealile, reassured, and ht&gt;peful, 
having but two thoughts: to conceal his name, and to sanctify his 
life ; to escape from men and to return to God. 

These two thoughts were associaletl so closely in hi,s mind, that 
they formed but a single one ; they were both equally absorbing and 
iraperiou,s, and ruled his sliglitest actions. Ordinarjly they were in 
harmony in the regulation of the conduct of his life; they turned 
him towards the dark si&lt;le of life; they made him benevolent and 
simple-hearted ; they coun-selled him to the .same things. Sometimes, 
however, there wa.s a conflict between them. In such cases, it will 

be remembered, the man, whom all the country around M sur 

M called Monsieur Madeleine, did not waver in sacrificing the 

first to the second, his security to lii.s virtue. Thus, in despite of all 
re.serve and of all prudence, he had kept the bishop’s candlesticks, 
worn mourning for him, called and questioned all the little Savoy- 
ards who pas.se&lt;l by, gathered information concerning the families 
at Faverolles, .and s.aved tlie life of old Fauchelevent, in spite of the 
disquieting insinuations of Javert. It would seem, we have already 
remarked, that he thought, following the example of all who have 
been wise, holy, and just, that his highest duty was not towards 
himself. 

But of all these occasions, it must be said, none had ever been 
anything like that which was now presiented. 

Never had the two ideas that governed the unfortunate man 
.whose suffering.*) we are relating, engaged in so serious a struggle. 
He comprehended this confusedly, but thoroughly, from the nrst 
Urords that Javert pronounced on entering his office. At the moment 
^hen that name which he had so deeply buried was so strangely ut- 
iired, he was seized with stupor, and as if intoxicated by me sm&gt; 
feer grotesqueness of his destiny, and through that stupor he fete 
He shudder which precedes great ^odcs ; he bent like an oak at the 
^proach of a storm, like a soldier at the approacbi of an assault. He

himself against all jmssibililies, 

A moment afterwards he blew nut his light. It annoyed him. 

It seemed to him that nomebcKly could nee him. 

Who? .Somebody? 



F A N T I N E 187 

Alas ! what he wanted to keep out of doors had entered ; what he 
wanted to render blind was looking upon him. His conscience. 

His conscience, that is to say, God. 

At the 'first moment, however, he deluded himself ; he had a 
feeling of safety and solitude ; the bolt drawn, he believed himself 
invisible. Then he took possession of himself ; he placed his elbows 
on the table, rested his head on his hand, and. set himself to meditat- 
ing in the darkness. 

“Where am 1 ? Am I not in a dream? What have I heard? Is it 
really true that I saw tliis Javert, and that he talked to me so? Who 
can this Champmathieu be? He resembles me then? Is it possible? 
When I think that yesterday I was so calm, and so far from sus- 
pecting anything ! What was I doing yesterday at this time ? What 
is there in this matter ? How will it turn out ? What is to be done ?’’ 

Such was the torment he was in. His brain had lost the power of 
retaining its ideas ; they passed away like waves, and he grasped his 
forehead with both hands to stop them. 

Out of this tumult, which overwhelmed his will and his reason, 
and from which he sought to draw a certainty and a resolution, 
nothing came clearly forth but anguish. 

His brain was burning; He went to the window and tlirew it wide 
open. Not a star was in the sky. He returned and sat down by the 
table. 

The first hour thus rolled away. 

Little l)y little, however, vague outlines began to take form and to 
fix themselves in his meditatioir ; he could jfi'eceive, with the pr'e- 
cision of reality, not the whole of the situation, but a few details. 

He began by recognising that, however extraordinary and critical 
the situation wa.s, he was completely master of it. 

His stupor only became the deeper. 

Independently of the severe and religious aim that his actions had 
in view, all that he had done up to this day was only a hole that be 
was digging in which to bury his name. What he had always most 
drca(le&lt;i, in his hours of self-communion, in his .sleepless nights, was 
the thought of ever hearing that name pronounced ; he felt that 
would be for him the end of all ; that the day on which that nanje 
should reappear would see vanish from around him his new Kfe, 
and, who knows, even perhaps his new soul from within him. He 
shuddered at tine bare thought that it was possible. Surely, if suay 
one had told him at such moments that an hour would come when 
that name would resound in his ear, when that hideous word, Jean 
Valjean, would start forth suddenly from the n^|ht «sd stand be- 
fore him ; when this fearful pflare, destined to disSpate the mystery 
in which he had wrapped himself, would Awh suddboly upon his 
head, and that this name would not meoaoe han, and that this glare 
would only make his disourity th« deeperi this rending of tibe

Thus he sj«&gt;ke in the depths of his conscience, hanging over what 
might he called his own ahy ;.s. He rose f inm his ciuiir, am! hegan to 
walk the room. *T'oiiie." saiil he, "let us think of it no more. The 
resoUiliort is fonneil !" lUtt he felt no joy. 

Quite the contrary. 

One can no more prevent the niiml from returning to an Uica 
than the sea from returning to a shore. In the case of the sailor, this 
is called the tide : in the case of the guilty, it is called remorse. God 
upheaves the soul as well as the oce.m. 

After *he lapse »if ji few nioinenis. he couh! ilo no otherwise, he 
resumed this somhre dialogue, in which it was himself who s|i«rko 
and himself who listened, saying what he wished to keep silent, lis- 
tening to what he did not wish to hear, ^yielding to that mysterious 
power which said to him: "think 1 ” as it said two thousand years 
ago to another comlemnci! : '‘niamh !*’

admirable and pure in his sight. That men saw his mask, but the 
bishop saw his face. That men saw his life, but the bishop saw his 
conscience. He must then go to Arras, deliver the wrong Jean Val- 
jean, denounce the right one, Alas ! that was the greatest of sacri- 
fices, the most poignant of victories, the final step to be taken, but he 
must do it. Mournful destiny 1 he could only enter into sancity in the 
eyes of God, by returning into infamy in the eyes of men ! 

“Well,” said he, “let us take this course ! let us do our duty ! Let 
us save this man !” 

He pronounced these words in a loud voice, without preceiving 
that he was spealcing aloud. 

He took his books, verified them, ^d put them in order. He threw 
into the fire a padcage of notes which he held against needy small 
traders. He wrote a letter, which he sealed, and upon the envelope 
of which might have been read, if there had been any one in the 
room at the time : Monsieur Laffitte, banker. Rue d’ Artois, Paris. 

He drew from a secretary a pocket-book containing some bank- 
notes and the passport that he had used that same year in going to 
the elections. 

Had any one seen him while he was doing tiaese various acts with 
such serious meditation, he would not have suspected what was 
passing within him. Still at intervals his lips quivered; at other 
times he raised his head and fixed his eye on some point of the wall, 
as if he saw just there something that he wished to clear up or to 
interrogate. 

The letter to Monsieur I-affitte finished, he put it in his pocket as 
well as the poCket-book, and began to walk again. 

The current of his thought had not dranged. He still saw his 
duty clearly written in luminous letters which flared out before his 
eyes, and moved with his gaze; “Go I avow thy name! denounce' 
thyself!" 

He saw also, and as if they were laid bare before him with sensi- 
ble forms, the two ideas which had been hitherto the double rule of 
his life, to conceal his name, and to sanctify his soul. For the first 
time, they appeared to him absolutely distinct, and he saw the differ- 
ence .which separated them. He recognised that one of these ideas 
was necessarily good, while tlie other might became evil ; that the 
former was devotion, and that the latter was selfishness ; that the 
one said : “the neighbour," and that the other said ; “me;" that the 
one came from the light, and the other from the night. 

They were fighting with each other. He saw them fighting. While 
he was looking, thqr had expanded before his mind's, eye ; they were 
now colossal] and it seemed to him that he saw struggling withun 
him, in that iidmite of winch we spoke Jnst‘now, in the midst of 
-darkness aiKl'gIkxm, a goddesss-'amd hi^g^atm^..'

He was full of dismay, but it seemed to luin tlKtt tK .* tin 
was gaining the victory. 

He felt that he had reached the seconjl tirci^ivc mj’ Ids 

conscience, and his destiny; that the I)ishop had marlon! tS/ hrst 
phase of his new life, and that lliis Champinathieu mailo'd tlu* sta,-- 
ond. After a great crisis, a great trial. 

Meanwhile the fever, quieted for an instant, returned xiin-m him 
little by little. A thousaiul tlu&gt;ught.s tlaslu'd across lum, t!u‘v 
fortified him in his resolution. 

One moment he had saitl: that perhafis lie tciidv thr a hair t uu 
much to heart, that after all thi.s Champtnathieu was nnt w* irlhv of 
interest, that in fact he had comniittetl tluot. 

He answered : If tliis man has in fact stolen a few a|ipier, ih.\,\ is 
a month in prison. There is a wide distance between tiLe .md the 
galleys. And who knows even? has he committed tlaoi : is it 
proven? the name of jean Valjean overwludms him, an*! ?rv;s lu 
dispense with pn.K&gt;fs. Are not prosecuting t^inris in the ImI* t «i! 
acting thus? They think him a roliher, hecaitse tlicv ktiuw Iraa to he 
a convict. 

At another moment the idea occtirrcil to him th;tt, if !ir ‘dn -uM *!*•• 
nounce. himself, [X'rhaps the hcndsin of Ids actiott, an ! In . !ioue;4; 
life for he pa.st seven years, and what he had d» aie h r flu* ^ * »unt r&gt; , 
wmuki bn considered, and he woultl !«* pardiaicd. 

But this supposition quickly vattislted, and he smde f IdUrn !v at 
the thought, that the rubbery of the fun y sous itom I Vfit tirrvais 
made him a second offender, tlud that maff er would rertaudy teap * 
pear, and by the precise terms of t!ie law he wottid he cne;» !cnined to 
Itard labour for life. 

He turned awaty from all ilhisittn, tlistmgaged hint^el! tu»ae and 
more from the earth, and sought ctmsMiathiU utu\ snrngih else- 
where, He said to himself that he must dij td^v ihuv ; tl^at pc rhafis 
even he should not he more nuhaiqw afti*r liaving dnnr hi i diile 
than after having evaded it; that if In- tel maiters alomy u he re- 
mained at M~- stir M- his reputation, Ids gMrol nunie, Ids 
|jood works, the defere«ct% the veneration he corninaudrd, Ids ^ liar- 
ity, his riches, his popularity, his virtue. wmiM laimrd a 
crime, and what pleasure would there lie in all iheo* h»dv thunfs tied 
to that hideous thing? while, if he rarried ottl the sa» rilo e, in tlir 
galleys, with his chain, with his iron rntlar, with his ^trvu t *tc with 
his perpetual labour, with his pitiless shame, there would hr asso 
ciat^ed a cele.stial idea. 

Finally, he said to himself that it was a neretsily. ihiil hi** tlrMinv 
was so fixed, that it was not for him to derfinge the nnmmrmrnU of 
God, that at all events he must choose, either virtwr w iih*m!, and 
abomination within, or sanctitv within, nml infamy wdthnut. 

In revolving so many gloomy ideas, his courage did iioi fail* Init 



F A N T I N E 193 

his brain was fatigued. He began in spite of himself to think of 
other things, of indifferent things. 

His blood rushed violently to his temples. He walked back and 
forth constantly. Midnight was struck first from tlie parish church, 
then from the city hall. He counted the twelve strokes of the two 
clocks, and he compared the sound of the two bells. It reminded 
him that, a few days before, he had seen at a junkshop an old bell 
for sale, upon which was this name : Antoine Albin de RomainzriUa. 

He was cold. He kindled a fire. He did not think to dose the win- 
dow. 

Meanwhile he had fallen into his stupor again. It required not a 
little effort to recall his mind to what he was thinking of befox'e the 
clock struck. He succeeded at la-st. 

“Ah ! yes,”'said he, “I had formed the re olution to denounce my- 
self.” 

And then all at once he thought of Fantine. 

“Stop !” said he, “this poor woman 1” 

Here was a new crisis. 

Fantine, abruptly appearing in his reverie, was like a ray of un- 
expected light. It seemed to him that everything around him was 
changing its aspect ; he exclaimed : 

“Alj ! yes, indeed ! so far I have only thought of myself ! I have 
only looked to my own convenience ! It is whetherl shall keep silent 
or denounce myself, conceal my body dr save my soul, be a despic- 
able and respected magistrate, or an infamous and venerable galley 
slave: it is myself, always myself, only myself. But, good God! all 
this is egotism. Different forms of egotism, but still egotism ! Sup- 
pose I should think a little of others ? The highest duty is to think of 
others. Let us see, let us examine ! I gone, I taken away, I forgotten ; 
what will become of all this ? I denounce myself ? I am arrested, this 
Champmathieu is released, I am sent back to the galleys ; veiy well, 
and what then ? what takes place here ? Ah ! here, there is a country, 

, A city, factories, a business, labourers, men, women, old grandfath- 
ers, children, poor people 1 1 have created all this, I keep it all alive; 
wherever a chimney is smoking, I have put the brands in the fire 
and the meat in the pot; I have produced ease, circulation, credit; 
before me there was nothing ; I have aroused, vivified, animate^ 
quickened, stimulated, enriched, all the country; without me, the 
soul is gone. I take myself away; it all dies. And this .woman who 
has suffered so much, who is so worthy in her fall, all whose mis- 
fortunes I have unconsciously caused 1 And that child which I was 
going for, which I have promised to the mother ! Do I not also owe 
something to this woman, in reparation for the wrong that I have 
done her? If I should disappear, what happens? The mother dies. 
The child becomes what she majik Tl:&amp; is wh^ comes to pass, if I

denounce myself ; and if I do not dcaouncc tnr.;c!;' ? I ,i-t u*; mt. if f

After putting this questicin, he slojiiied ; fur a iunnu-ot hr hvJ- 
tated and irembled; but that inonicnt was brief, and hr an- weir,! 
with calmness : 

“Well, this man goes to the galleys, it is inie. bn!. w!ta! m' ?

He arose and resumed lii.s walk, 'f'liis time it smiie&lt;l to him that 
he was satisfied. 

Diamonds are found only in tlie dark places of the earlli ; ii utlis 



F A N T I N E 195 

are found only in the depths of thought. It seemed to him that after 
having descended into these depths, after having groped long. in the 
blackest of this darkness, he had at last found one of tliese dia- 
monds, one of these truths, and that he held it in his hand ; and it 
blinded him to look at it. 

“Yes,” thought he, “that is it ! I am in the true road. I have the 
solution. I must end by holding fast to sometliing. My dioice is 
made. Let the matter alone 1 No more vacillation, no more shrink- 
ing. This is in the interest of all, not in my own. I am Madeleine, I 
remain Madeleine. Woe to him who is Jean Valjean ! He and I are 
no longer the same. I do not recognise that man, I no longer know 
what he is ; if it is found that anybody is Jean Valjean at this hoijr, 
let him take care of himself. That does not concern me. That is a 
fatal name which is floating about in the darkness , if it stops and 
settles upon any man, so much the worse for that man." 

He looked at himself in the little mirror that hung over his man- 
tel-piece and said : 

“Yes ! To come to a resolution has solaced me 1 1 am quite another 
man now !" 

He took a few steps more, then he stopped short. 

“Come!” said he, “I must not hesitate before any of the conse- 
quences of the resolution I have formed. There are yet some threads 
which knit me to this Jean Valjean. They must be broken ! There 
are, in this very room, objects which would accuse me, mute things 
which would be witnesses ; it is done, all these must disappear,” . 

He felt in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out 
a little key. 

He put this key into a lock the hole of which was hardly visible, 
losit as it was in the darkest shading of the figures on thj paper 
which covered the wall. A secret door opened ; a kind of false press 
built teween the corner of the wall and the casing of the chimney. 
There was nothing in this closet but a few refuse trifles ; a blue 
smock-frock, an old pair of trousers, an old haversack, and a great 
thorn stick, iron-bound at both ends. Those who had seen Jean Val- 
jean at the time he ;^ssed through D , in October, 1815, wotdd 

have recognized easily all the fragments of this miserable outfit. 

He had kept them, as he had kept the alver csmdiesticks, to re- 
mind him at all times of what he had been. But he concealed what 
came from the galleys, wd left the candlesticks that came frc«n ^ 
bishop in sight, &gt; ' ' 

He cast a furtive look towards the door, as if he were afraid it 
iwould open hs spite of the bolt that held it ; then with a jq^ick and 
hasty movement and at a single atrmful, without cv«a a i^ance at 
Ibese things which he had kept so reli^ously knd with so much dan- 
ger during so .many years, he took the whote, rags, stick, iiaversadk, 
and threw them all into the fire. • :

him had not en&lt;iecL It amtiiuied ;

“Jean Valjean ! there shall be about you many voices which will 
make great noise, which will speak very loud, and which will bless 
you ; and one only which nobody shall hear, and which will curse 
you in the darkness. Well, listen, wretcli ! all these blessings shall 
fall before they reach Heaven ; only the curse shall mount into the 
presence of God !’' 

This voice, at first quite feeble, and which was raised from the 
most obscure depths of his conscience, had_ become by degrees loud 
and formidable, and he heard it now at his ear. It seemed to him 
that it had emerged from himself, and that it was speaking now 
from without. He thought he heard the last words so distinctly that 
he looked about the room with a kind of terror. 

“Is there anybody here ?” asked he, aloud and in a startled voice. 

Then he continued with a laugh, which was like the laugh of an 
idiot : 

“What a fool I am ! there cannot be anybody here.” 

There was One ; but He who was there was not of such as the 
human eye can see. 

He put the candlesticks on the mantel. 

Then he r.sumed this monotonous and dismal walk, which dis- 
turbed the man asleep beneath him in his dreams, and wakened him 
out of his sleep. 

This walk soothed him and excited him at the same time. It some- 
times seems that on the greatest occasions we put ourselves in mo- 
tion in order to ask advice from whatever we may meet by change 
of place. After a few moments he no longer knew where he was. 

He now recoiled with equal terror from each of the resolutions 
which he had fonned in turn. Each of the two ideas which coun- 
selled him, appeared to him as fatal as the other. What a fatality! 
What a chance that this Champmathieu should be mistaken for 
him I To be hurled down headlong by the very means which Provi- 
dence seemed at first to have employed to give him full security. 

There was a moment during which he contemplated the future. 
Denounce himself, great God! Give himself up! He saw with in- 
finite despair all that he must leave, all that he must resume. He 
must then bid farewell to this existence, so good, so pure, so radi- 
ant ; to this respect of all, to honour, to liberty ! No more would he 
' go out to walk in the fields, never again would he hear the birds 
; singing in the month of May, never more give alms to the little chii- 
;4ren 1 No longer would he feel the sweetness of looks of grathude 
Sand of love! He would leave this house that he had built, thia little 
*toom ! Everything appeared charming to him now. He would read 
ffio more in these books, he would write no more on this little white 
^ood table! His old portress, the only servant 'll* had, would no 
S)nger bring him his coffee in the xfidrmng. Great God ! instead of

IV 

FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING RT.pet &gt; 

The clock struck three. For five hours he had been walking thus, 
almost without interruption, when he dropped into his chair. 

He fell asleep and dreamed. 

_ This dream, like most dreams, had no further relation to the con- 
dition of_ affairs than its mournful a.nd poignant character, but it 
made an impression upon him. This nightmare strudc him so forci- 
bly that he afterwards wrote it down. It is one of the papers in his 
own handwriting, which he has left behind him. We think it our 
duty to copy it here literally. 

Whatever this dream may be, the story of that night would be 
incomplete if we should omit it. It is the gloomy adventure of a sick 
soul. 

It is as follows: Upon the envelope we find this line written; 
"‘The dream that I had that night"’ 

“1 was in a field. A great sad field where there was no grass. It 
did not seem tliat it was day, nor that it was night. 

“I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childhood'; 
this brother of whom I must say that I never think, and whom I 
scarcely remember. 

“We were talking, and we met others walking. We were speak- 
ing of a neighbour we had formerly, who, since she had lived in the 
street, always worked with her window open. Even while we talked, 
we felt cold on account ^ that open wiirdow. , 

“There were no trees m the field. 

“We saw a man passing near us. He was entirely naked, ashen- 
coloured, mounted upon a horse which was of the colour of earth. 
The man had no hair ; we saw his dcull and the veins in his skull. In 
his hand he held a stick which was limter like a twig; of grape vine, 
and heavy as iron. This horseman passed by and said nothing. 

"My brother said to me : *Let us take the deserted road.’ 

“There was a deserted road where we saw not a bush, even a 
sprig of moss. All was of the colour of earth, even lb# :A few 
steps further, and no one atteweraJ me when I epc^; T ]^rceived 
that my brother was no lom^with me. V ' ‘

made the sa,shes of the still o|K&lt;n window swing on ilu ii bun:* s 1 he 
fire had gone out. The candle was low in the soi ki-t, t he nigfil w .i'. 
yet dark. 

1 Ic arose and went to the window. There were sidl no star s in the 
sky. 

From his window he could U«ik into the court vard and into the 
street. A harsh, rattling noise that suddenly resutindrd from the 
ground made him Iwik down. 

He saw below him two red stars, whose rays dancetl l&gt;ark and 
forth grotesquely in the shadow. 

His mind was still half buried in the mist of his reverie ; ''Yesr* 
thought he, "there are none in the sky. They are on the earth now." 



F A N T I N E 201 

This confusion, however, faded away ; a second noise like the first 
awakened him completely ; he looked, and_ he saw that these two 
stars wei-e the lamps of a carriage. By the light which they emitted, 
he could distinguish the form of a carriage. It was a tilbury drawn 
by a small white horse. The noi.se which he had heard was the sound 
of the horse’s hoofs upon the pavement. 

“What carriage is that ?” said he to himself. “Who is it that comes 
so early ?’’ 

At that moment there was a low rap at the door of his room. 

He shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice: 

"Who is there?” 

Some one answered : 

"I, Mon.sieur Mayor.” 

He. recognised the voice of the old woman, his portress. 

“Well,’; said he, "what is it ?” 

"Monsieur Mayor, it is just five o’clock,” 

"What is that to me ?” 

“Monsieur Mayor, it is the chaise.” 

“What chai.se ?" 

“The tilbury.” 

“What tilbury?” 

“Did not Monsieur the Mayor order a tilbury ?” 

"No,” s.aid he. 

“The driver says that he has come for Monsieur the Mayor.” 

"What driver?” 

"Monsieur Scaufflaire’s driver.” 

“Monsieur Scaufflaire?” 

That name startled him as if a flash had pa.ssed before his face. 

“Oh, yes !” he said, "Monsieur Scaufflaire !” 

Could the old woman have seen him at that moment she would . 
have been frightened. ' m'' 

There was a long silence. He examined the flame of the, candle 
with a stupid air, and took some of the melted wax from around 
the wick and rolled it in his fingers. The old woman was waiting. 
She ventured, however, to speak again : 

"Monsieur Mayor, what shall I s&amp;y^ ?” 

“Say that it is right, and I am coming down.”

that it was true that Javert would be there, and Brevet, Chenildieu, 
Cochepaille, old convicts who had known him; but surely they 
would not recognise him ; bah ! what an idea ! that Javert was a 
hundred miles off the track ; that all conjectures and all suppositions 
were fixed upon this Champmathieu, and that nothing is so stubborn 
as suppositions and conjectures ; that there was, therefore, no dan- 
ger. 

That it was no doubt a dark hour, but that he should get through 
it ; that after all he held his destiny, evil as it might be, in his own 
hand ; that he was master of it. He clung to that thought. 

In reality, to tell the ti-utlx, he would have preferred not to go to 
Arras. 

Still he was on the way. 

Although absorbed in thought, he whipped up his horse, which 
.trotted away at that regular and sure full trot that gets over two 
leagues and a half an hour. 

In proportion as the tilbury went forward, he felt something 
within him which shrank back. 

At daybreak he was in the open country ; the city of jM-— — sur 

M was a long way behind. He saw the horizon growing lighter ; 

he beheld, without seeing them, all the frozen figures of a winter 
dawn pass before his eyes. Morning has its spectres as well as eve- 
ning. He did not .see them, but, without his consciousness, and by a 
kind of penetration which was almost physical, those black outlines 
of trees and hills added to the tumultuous state of his soul an in- 
describable gloom and apprehension. 

Every time he passed one of the isolated houses that stood here 
and there by the side of the road, he said to himself : “But yet, 
there are people there who are sleeping !’’ 

The trotting of the horse, the rattling of the harness, the wheels 
upon the pavement, made a gentle, monotonous sound. These things 
are charming when one is joyful, and mournful when one is sad. 

It was broad day when he arrived at Hesdin. He stopped before 
an inn to let his horse breathe and to have some oats given him. 

Thi.s horse was, as Scaufflaire had said, of that small breed oi 
the Boulonnais which has too much head, too much belly, and net 
enough neck, but which has an open chest, a large rump, fine and 
slender leg-s, and a firm foot ; a homely race, but strong and sound. 
The excellent animal had made five leagues in two hours, and had 
not turned a hair. - . , , 

He did not get out of the tilbury. The stable boy who brought 
the oats stooped down suddenly ana examined the left wheel, 

“Have you gone far so?" said the man. ^ , 

He answered, almost without breaking up his train of thought ; 

“Have you come far?” said the bey. 



204 ' ■ LES MlsiRAin-ES 


“Five leagues from here.” 

“Ah!” 

“.Why do you say : ah 

The hoy stooped down again, was sm-iit a i!i&lt;micnt, v. iih h!^ i‘\e 
fixed on the wheel, then he rose ni&gt; saving : 

“To think that tins wheel lias just n.iiu: livr U'a:;u. mat i&gt; pus-

“A wheel to exchange?” 

“Yes." 

“I have not a wheel made for your cabriolet. Two wheels make i

“In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.” 

“Monsieur, every wheel doesn’t go on to every axle ” 

‘‘But try.” 

“It’s of no use, monsieur. I have nothing but cart wheels to sell. 
,We are a small place here.” 

“Have you a cabriolet to let ?” 

The wheelwright, at the first glance, had seen that the tilbury 
was a hired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders. 

■ “You take good care of the cabriolets that you hire ! I should have 
one a good while before I would let it to you/’ 

“Well, sell it to me.” 

“I have not one.” 

“What ! not even a carriole? I am not hard to suit, as you see.” 
“We are a little place. True, I have under the old shed there,” 
added the wheelwright, “an old chaise that belongs to a citizen of 
the place, who has given it to me to keep, and who usese it every 
29th of February. I would let it to you, of course it is nothing to me. 
The citizen must not see it go by, and then, it is clumsy ; it would 
talce two horses.” 

“I will take two post-horses.” 

“Where is monsieur going ?” 

“To Arras./ 

“And monsieur would like to get there to-day?” 

“I would.” ‘ 

"By taking post-horses ?” . 

“Why not?’; 

“Will monsieur be satisfied to arrive by four o’clock to-morrow 
morning?” 

“No, indeed.” 

“I mean, you see, that there is something to be said, in taking 
post-horses. Monsieur has his passport?” ' 

“Yes.” 

“Well, by taking post-horses, monsieur will not Teach Arras 
before to-morrow. We are a cross-road. The relays are poorly 
served, the horses are in the fields. The ploughing season has just 
.commenced; heavy teams are needed, and tlie horses are taken 
from everywhere, from the post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will 
have to wait at least three or four hours at each relay, and then 
they go at a walk. There are a good many hillte to climb.” 

, _ “Well, I will go On horsebadc. Unhitch the cabriolet. Somebody

that we should not have had to relate any of the events which fol- 
low, but that conversation occurred in the street. Every colloquy 
in the street inevitably gathers a drcle. There are always people who 
ask nothing better than to be spectators. While he was questioning 
the wheelwright, some of the passers-by had stopped around them. 
After listening for a few minutes, a young boy whom no one had 
noticed, had separated from the group and ran away. 

At the instant the traveller, after the internal deliberation which 
yre have just indicated, was making up his mind to go back, this 
boy returned. He was accompanied by an old woman. 

“Monsieur,” said the woman, “my boy tells me that you are 
anxious to hire a cabriolet” 

This simple speech, uttered by an old woman who was brought 
there by a boy, made the sweat pour down his back. He thought he 
saw the hand he was but now freed from reappear in the shadow 
behind him, all ready to seize him again. 

He answered : 

“Yes, good woman, I am looking for a cabriolet to hire.” 

And he hastened to add : 

“But there is none in the place.” 

“Yes, there is,” said the dame. 

“Where is it then ?” broke in the wheelwright. 

“At my house,” replied the dame. 

He shuddered. The fatal hand had closed upon him again. 

The old woman had, in fact, under a shed, a sort of willow 
carriole. The blacksmith and the boy at the inn, angry that the 
traveller should escape them, intervened. 

“It was a frightful go-cart, it had no springs, it was true the seat 
was hung inside with leather straps, it would not keep out the 
rain, the wheels were rusty and rotten, it couldn’t go much further 
than the tilbury, a real jumper ! This gentlemcun would do very 
• wrong to set out in it,” etc., etc. . 

This was all true, but this go-cart, this jumper, this thing, what- 
ever it might be, went upon two wheels and could go to Arras. 

He paid what was asked, left the tilbury to be mended at the 
blacksmith’s agaipst his return, had the white horse harnessed to 
the carriole, got in, and resumed the route he had followed since 
morning. 

The moment the carriole started, he acknowledged that he had 
felt an instant before a certain joy at the thought that he should not 
go where he was going. He examined that joy with a sort of angcf, 
and thought it absurd.^ Why should he feel joy at gcrog back? 
After all, he was making a journey of his own accord, nobody 
forced him to it. 

;; And certainly, nothing could happen which he did not choose to 
ihave happen. '

As he was leaving Hesdin, he heard a voice crying ; ‘‘Sjopl 
stop!'' He stopped the carriole with a hasty inovetnenl, in winch 
there was still something strangely feverish and convulsive winch 
iyosembled hope. 

It was the dame’s little hoy. 

“Monsieur,” said he, “it was I who got the cari'iole for you," 
“Well 1” 

“You have not given me anytliiug.’' 

He, who gave to all, and so freely, felt this claim was exorhiiant 
wild almost odious. 

“Oh ! is it you, you beggar ?” said lu\ “you sliali have 

He whipped up the horse an&lt;l started away at a quick tmt. 

He had lost a good deal of time at llesdin, he wished tn suakr it 
up. The little horse was plucky, and pulUal enou:»!« for twu ; hm it 
was February, it had rained, the roatls were had. Aiiil then, it uas 
no longer the tilbury. The carriole ran hard, and was very ht/aw. 
And besides there were many stee|&gt; hills. 

He was almost four hours going front llestliti to Saint iNd. Innir 
hours for five leagues. 

At Saint Pol he drove to the nearest itm. and had the linr a: taken 
to the stable. As he had promised Scaulllaire. he ,'*tontd near th,e

and confused. 


The innkeeper’s wife came into iht* stable.

“Why, it is true.” said he. “! liave a giMnl api^etite.”

thousand objects for the first and for the last time, what can be 
deeper and more melancholy ? Tc travel is to be born and to die at 
every instant. It may be that in the most shadowy portion of his 
mind, he was drawing a comparison between these changing hori- 
zons and human existence. All the facts of life are perpetually in 
flight before us. Darkness and light alternate with each other. After 
a flash, an eclipse ; we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands 
to seize what is passing; every event is a turn of the road ; and all 
at once we are old. We feel a slight shock, all is black, we distin- 
guish a dark door, this gloomy horse of life which was carrying us 
stops, and we see a veiled and unknown form that turns him out 
into the darkness. 

Twilight was falling just as the children coming out of school 
beheld our traveller entering Tinques. It is true that the days were 
still short. He did not stop at Tinques. As he was driving out of the 
village, a countryman who was repairing the road, raised his head 
and said : 

“Your horse is very tired.*' 

The poor beast, in fact, was not going faster than a walk. 

“Are you going to Arras ?** added the countryman. 

“Yes.*' 

“If you go at this rate, you won*t get there very early.'' 

He stopped his horse and asked the countryman: 

“How far is it from here to Arras ?** 

“Near seven long leagues.** 

“How is that ? the post route only counts five and a quarter.** 
“Ah !** replied the workman, “then you don*t know that the road 
i^ being repaired. You will find it cut off a quarter of an hour from 
here. There’s no means of going further.** 

“Indeed!** 

“You will take the left, the road that leads to Carency, and cross 
the river ; when you are at Camblin, you will turn to the right ; that 
is the road from Mont Saint-Eloy to Arras.** 

“But it is night, I shall lose my way.** 

“You are not of these parts ?** 

“No.** 

“Besides, they are all cross-roads.** 

“Stop, monsieur,** the countr3^man continued, “do you want I 
should give you some advice? 'Four horse is tired; go back tc 
Tinques. There is a good house there. Sleep there. You can go bn 
to Arras to-morrow.** 

“I must be there to-night — ^this evening!** 

“That is another thing. Then go hack all the same to that inn, 
and take an extra horse. The boy that will go with the horse will

He followed the countryman’s advice, retraced his steps, and a

half hour afterwards he again passed the same place, init at a full 
trot, with a good extra horse. A stable-linv, who called iiimself a 
postillion, was sitting upon the shaft of tlie carriole. 

He felt, however, that he was losing time. It was lunv quite dark. 

They were driving through a enws-path. 'I'lie road heeaiiie f right- 
ful. The carriole tumbled from one rut to tlie other. He said to 
the postillion: 

“Keep up a trot ,and double drink-money." 

In one of the jolts the whifllc-tree broke. 

“Monsieur," said the postillion, “the wiiiflle-tree is broken ; I do 
not know how to harness my horse now, this roatt is very li.ul .at 
' night, if you will come back and st(»p at 'I'inques, we c.;in be at Arras 
early to-morrow morning." 

He answered : “Have you a piece of .string and a knife ?" 

“Yes, monsieur." 

He cut oilf the limb of a tree and made a wliiiile tree of it. 

This was another loss of twenty minutes; but they stalled eff 
at a gallop. 

The plain was dark. A low fog, thick nfi-i bkiek, was i reaping 
over the hill-tops and lloating ;iway like .sm»*ke. Thei e were gliiii- 
mering Ha.shes from tiie clouds. A .strong wind, which can.e iruni

“AVliat o’clock is tliat ?" 

“Seven o’clock, monsieur; we shall lie in An’.as at eigfit. We

VI 

SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF 

Meanwhile, at that veiy moment, Fantine was in ecstasies. 

She had passed a very bad night. Cough -frightful, fever re- 
doubled ; she had bad dreams. In the morning, when the doctor 
cam-e, she was delirious. He appeared to be alarmed, and asked to 
be informed as soon as Monsieur Madeleine came. 

All the morning she was low-spirited, spoke little and was mak- 
ing folds in the sheets, murmuring in a low voice oyer some calcu- 
lations which appeared to be calculations of distances. Her eyes 
were hollow and fixed. The light seemed almost gone out, but then, 
at moments, they would be lighted up and sparkle like stars. It seems 
as though at the approach of a certain dark hour, the light of 
heaven infills those who are leaving the light of earth. 

Whenever Sister Simphce asked her how she was, she answered 
invariably: *Well. I would like to see Monsieur Madeleine.'' 

A few months earlier, when Fantine had lost the last of hei 
. modesty, her last shame and her last happiness, she was the shadow 
of herself ; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering 
' had completed the work of moral suffering. This creature of twen- 
ty-five years had a wrinkled forehead, flabby cheeks, pinched nos- 
trils, shrivelled gums, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, protruding 
collar-bones, skinny limbs, an earthy skin, and her fair hair was 
mixed with grey. Alas ! how sickness extemporises old age. 

At noon the doctor came again, left a few prescriptions, inquired 
if the mayor had been at the infirmary, and shook his head. 

Monsieur Madeleine usually came at three o'clock to see the sick 
woman. A«5 exactitude was kindness, he was exact. 

About half-past two, Fantine began to be agitated. In the spacer 
of twenty minutes, she asked the nun more tlian ten times: ‘'My 
sister, what time is it ?" 

The clock struck three. At the third stroke, Fantine rose up in 
bed — ordinarily she could hardly turn herself — she joined her two 
shrunken and yellow hands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the 
nun heard from her one of those deep sighs which seein to uplift 
great weight. Then Fantine turned and looked towards the door. 

Nobody came in ; the door did not open. 

She sat so for a quarter of an hour, her eyes fixed upon the door, 
motionless, and as if holding her breath. The sister dared not 
speak. The church clock struck the quarter. Fantine fell back upon 
her pillow. 

She said nothing, andi again began to make folds iii the sheet. 

A half-hour passed, then an hour, but no one came : everv time 



212 L E S M I S E R A H h K S 

the clock struck, Fantine I'ose and looked inwards the donr. then 

she fell back. 

Her thought could be clearly seen, hut she pnnioutuH-d nauu\ 
she did not coniplaiu, she foun&lt;l no faiilu &gt;he onlv eiiuidu'd na »uni- 
fully. One would have said that sianething dark w;v^ stiihug iluwn 
upon her. She was livid, and her lips wri’e l)!ue. &gt;!u,* stuiUai at 
times* 

The clock struck five. Then the sister Ijeard her s|HMk very Imv 
and gently : '‘But since I am going away treineu rnw , he dnt^s wrt&gt;fig 
not to come to-day !'* 

Sister SimpHce herself was surpriseil at Momieur ,Mada*H‘ine*s 
delay. 

Meanwhile, Fantine was looking at the eauMpv of hw hr&gt;l. SIhj 
seemed to be seeking to recall something t*? hw truii!. Al! at mu e 
she began to sing in a vnta* as feeble us a wliisjtfi', 1 he tmo !i tened. 
This is what Fantine sang :

FANTINE 213 

This was an old nursery song with which she once used to sing 
her little Cosette to sleep, and which had not occurred to her mind 
for the five years since she had had her child with her. She sang it in 
a voice so sad, and to an air so sweet, that it could not but draw 
tears even from a nun. The sister, accustomed to austerity as she 
was, felt a drop upon her cheek. 

The clock struck six. Fantine did not appear to hear. She seemea 
no longer to pay attention to anything around her. 

Sister Simplice sent a girl to inquire of the portress of the fac- 
tory if the mayor had come in, and if he would not very soon come 
to the infirmary. The girl returned in a few minutes. 

Fantine was still motionless, and appeared to be absorbed in her 
own thoughts. 

The servant related in a whisper to Sister Simplice that the mayor 
had gone away that morning before six o'clock in a little tilbury 
drawn by a white hoi-se, cold as the weather was; that he -went 
alone, without even a driver, that no one knew the road he had 
taken, that some said he had been seen to turn off by the road to 
Arras, that others were sure they had met him on the road to 
Paris. That when he^ went away he seemed, as usual, very kind, 
and that he simply said to the portress that he need not be expected 
that night. 

While the two women were whisperingf, with their backs turned 
towards Fantine's bed, the sister questioning, the servant con- 
jecturing, Fantine, with that feverish vivacity of certain organic 
diseases, which unites the free movement of health with the fright- 
ful exhaustion of death, had risen to her knees on the bed, her 
shrivelled hands resting on the bolster, and with her head passing 
through the opening of the curtains, she listened. All at once she 
exclaimed: 

'‘You are talking there of Monsieur Madeleine ! why do you talk 
so low? what has he done? why does he not come?" * 

The Virgin Marjr to my bed 
Came yesterday in broidered cloak 
And told me: **Hcre hidden in itiy veil 
Is the babe that once you asked of me." 

*‘Ritn to the town, get linen, 

Buy thread, buy a thimble," 

We will buy very nretty things, 

A walking through the faubourgs. 

Good holy Virgin, by my bed 
I have put a cradle draped with ribbons; 

Were God to give me his fairest star, 

I should love the babe thou hast given me more, 

*‘Madame, what shall be done with this linen?" 

"Make a trousseau for my new-born." 

Violets are blue, roses are red, 

Violets are blue, I love my loves. 



214 L E S M I S 15 R A B T. K S 

Her voice was so harsh and rough that liie two women thouglit 
they heard the voice of a man ; they turnetl tt^wanls her affrighted. 
"‘Why don't you answer?” cried Fantine. 

The servant stammered out : 

""The portress told me that he could not ctnnc to-day/’ 

""My child,” said the sister, "‘he calm, lie down again.” 

Fantine, without changing her attitude, resumeti with a hnul 
voice, and in a tone at once piercing and im|HTinus : 

“He cannot come* Why not? know the reasr&gt;n. wma* 
whispering it there between you* I want to km ►wf' 

The servant whispered quickl}^ in tlie mu/s ear; “Answer that 
he is busy with the City Council.” 

Sister Simplice reddened slightly; it w?is a lie tlmt tfu* serv;mt 
had proposed to her. On the other hand, it fiii! seem tu her that to 
tell the truth to the sick woman woultl &lt;it.&gt;ul&gt;t!ess he a ten i!*le 
and that it was dangerous in tlie state in whit’h hatuine was. 
blush did not last long. The sister turnet! her calm, sad vyv. upoii 
Fantine, and said ; 

‘"The mayor has gone away.” 

Fantine sprang up and sat upon her feet. Uvr vyvs -sparkled. A 
• marvellous joy spread over (hat monnifttl fai(% 

""Gone away!” she cxclaime&lt;k “Hit has g‘»ne h»r 
Then she stretched her hands towards heaveti, and le r whole 
countenance became ineffable. Her lips movcil ; slur was prayim,; in 
a whisper. 

When her prayer was ended: “My sistiT/’ sail! sfie, “! am quit*;

FANTINE 215 

Fantine took the sister’s hand between hers , they were moist ; 
the sister was pained to feel it. 

“He started this morning for Paris. Indeed he need not even go 
through Paris. Montfermeil is a little to the left in coming. You 
remember what he said yesterday, when I spoke to him about Co- 
sette: Very soon, very soon! This is a surprise he has for me. You 
know he had me sign a letter to take her away from the Thenardiers 
They will have nothing to say, will they? They will give up Cosette. 
Because they have their pay. The authorities would not let them 
keep a child when they are paid. My sister, do not make signs to 
me that I must not talk. I am very happy, I am doing very well. I 
have no pain at all, I am going to see Cosette again, I am hungry 
even. For almost five years I have not seen her. You do not, you 
cannot imagine what a hold children have upon you ! And then she 
will be so handsome, you will see ! If you knew, she has such pretty 
little rosy fingers ! First, she will have very beautiful hands. At a 
year old she had ridiculous hands, — so! She must be large now. 
She is seven years old. She is a little lady. I call her Cosette, but 
her name is Euphrasie. Now, this morning I was looking at the 
dust on the mantel, and I had an idea that I should see Cosette 
again very soon I Oh, dear ! how wrong it is to be years witliout 
seeing one’s children ! We ought to remember tha^ life is not eter- 
nal ! Oh ! how good it is in the mayor to go — ^true, it is very cold I 
He had his cloak, at least ! He will be here to-morrow, will he not ? 
That will make to-morrow a fete. To-morrow morning, my sister, 
you will remind me to put on my little lace cap. Montfermeil is a 
country place. I made the trip on foot once. It was a long way for 
me. But the diligences go very fast. He will be here to-morrow with 
Cosette ! How far is it from here to Montfermeil ?” 

The sister, who had no idea of the distance, answered: “Oh! 
I feel sure that he will be here to-morrow.” 

“To-morrow ! to-morrow !” said Fantine, “I shall see Cosette to- 
morrow ! See, good Sister of God, I am well now. I am wild ; I 
would dance, if anybody wanted me to.” 

One who had seen her a quarter of an hour before could not have 
understood this. Now she was all rosy ; she talked in a lively, natural 
tone ; her whole face was only a smile. At times she laughed while 
whispering to herself. A mother's joy is almost like a child's. 

“Well,” resumed the nun, “now you are happy, obey me-^o not 
talk any more.” 

Fantine laid her head upon the pillow, and said in a low voice : 

“Yes, lie down again ; be prudent now that you are going to have 
Your-child. Sister Simplice is right. All here are right.” 

And then, without movine. or turning her head, she began to

and that, not being certain, they had nut tliMse/u i-e t tiU'

Arras. The man ’/ aco-l «e have followed thus far,’ got out, answered 
the hospitalities of the inn’s people with an absent-minded air, sent 
bade the extra horse, and took the little white one to the stable 
himself ; then he opened the door of a billiard-room on the first 
floor, took a seat, and leaned his elbows on the table. He had spent 
fourteen hours in this trip, which he expected to make in six. He 
did himself the justice to feel that it was not his fault ; but at bottom 
he was not sorry for it. 

The landlady entered. 

'‘Will monsieur have a bed ? will monsieur have supper?” 

He shook his head. 

"The stable-boy says that monsieur’s horse is very tired !” 

Here he broke silence. 

"Is not the horse able to start again to-morrow morning?” 

“Oh ; monsieur ! he needs at least two days’ rest.” 

He asked : , 

"Is not the Bureau of the Post here?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The hostess led him to the Bureau ; he showed his passport and 
inquired if there were an opportunity to return that very night to 

M sur M— ■ — by the mail coach ; only one seat was vacant, 

that by the side of the driver; he retained it and paid for it. "Mon- 
• sieur,” said the booking clerk, “don't fail to be here ready to start 
at precisely one o’clock in the morning.” 

This done, he left the hotel and began to walk in the city. 

He was not acquainted in Arras, the streets were dark, and he 
went haphazard. Nevertheless he seemed to refrain obstinately 
from asking his way. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found 
himself in a labyrinth of narrow streets, where he was soon lost. 
A citizen came along with a lantern. After some hesitation, he de- 
termined to speak to this man, but not until he had looked before 
and behind, as if he were afraid that somebody might overhear the 
question he was about to ask. 

“Monsieur,” said he, "the court house, if you please?” ^ 

“You are not a resident of the city, monsieur,” answered the 
citizen, who was an old man, “well, follow me, I am going right 
f by the court house, that is to say, the city hall. For they are repair- 
ing the court house just now, and the courts are holding theii 
.. sessions at the city hall, temporarily.” 

; “Is it there,” asked he, “that the assizes are held?” 

“Certainly, monsieur; you see, what is the city hall to-day was 
^l^the bishop’s palace before the revolution. Monsieur de Conzie, who 

i f was bishop in ’eighty-two, had a large hall bujlt. The court is held 
|tathathall.” 

I As they walked along, the citizen said tg him s

child, the infanticide was proven, the jury were not satisfied that 
there was any premeditation ; she was sentenced for life.” 

“It is a woman, then ?” said he. 

“Certainly. The Limosin girl. What else are you speaking of ?” 

“Nothing, but if it is finished ; why is the hall still-lighted up ?” 

“That is for the other case, which commenced nearly two hours 
ago.” 

“What other case ?” 

“Oh ! that is a clear one also. It is a sort of a thief, a second 
offender, a galley slave, a case of robbery. I forget his name. He 
looks like a bandit. Were it for nothing but having such a face, I 
would send him to the galleys.” 

“Monsieur,” asked he, “is there any means of getting into the 
hall?” 

“I think not, really. There is a great crowd. However, they are 
taking a recess. Some people have come out, and when the session 
is resumed, you can try.” 

“How do you get in ?” 

“Through that large door.” 

The lawyer left him. In a few moments, he had undergone, 
almost at the same time, almost together, all possible emotions. 
The words of this indifferent man had alternately pierced his heart 
like icicles and like flames of fire. When he learned that it was not 
concluded, he drew breath ; but he could not have told whether what 
he felt was satisfaction or pain. 

He approached several groups and listened to their talk. The 
calendar of the term being very heavy, the judge had set down two 
short, simple cases for that day. They had begun with the infanti- 
cide, and now were on the convict, the second offender, the “old 
stager.” This man had stolen some apples, but that did not appear 
to be very well proven ; what was proven, was that he had been in 
the galleys at Toulon. This was what ruined his case. The exami- 
nation of the man had been finished, and the testimony of the wit- 
nesses had been taken ; but there yet remained the argument of the 
counsel, and the summing up of his prosecuting attorney ; it would 
hardly be finished before midnight. The man would probably be 
condemned the prosecuting attorney was very good, and never 
failed with his prisoners ; he was a fellow of talent-, who wrote 
poetry, 

. An officer stood near the door which opened into the court- 
room. He asked this officer: 

“Monsieur, will the door be opened soon ?” 

“It will not be opened,” said the officer. 

^ “How 1 it will not be opened when the session is resumed ? is there 
pot a recess?" .. , ' '

“The session has just Iwen ivvanied," answeral the ulficer, “hut 
the door will not be opened 

“Why not?” 

“Because the hall is full.” 

“What ! there are no n'ore seats ?" 

“Not a single one. TI;e «lo&lt;&gt;r is eiosed. No one ran entfr.’' 

The officer added, after a silence: '“lliere are indeed iwo or 
three places .still behind Monsieur the .Indge, bnt MMiisieur the 
Judge admits none hut public fvinctiojiaries to tliein." 

So saying, the ofiicei turned his hack. 

He retired with his head bowe&lt;i down, crossed ilu; ante-ehaniber, 
and walked slowly down the staircase, seeming to hcMiate aj even' 
step. It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself. The 
violent combat that luul been going on witbiii bitn siiu »• ilu- pi cvanis

1 he judge of ihe Royal Court of Doutl. who was holding this 



F A N T I N E 221 

term of the assizes at Arras, was familiar, as well as everybody 
else, with this name so profoundly and so universally honoured. 
When the officer, quietly opening the door which led from the coun- 
sel chamber to the court room, bent behind the judge's chair and 
handed him the paper, on which was written the line we have just 
read, adding: ''This gentleman desires to witness the trials' the 
judge made a hasty movement of deference, seized a pen, wrote a 
few words at the bottom of the paper and handed it back to the 
ofl&amp;cer, saying to him : '‘Let him enter." 

The unhappy man, whose history we are relating, had remained 
near the door of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude 
as when the officer left him. He heard, through his thoughts, solne 
one saying to him : “Will monsieur do me the honour to follow 
me?" It was the same officer who had turned his back upon him 
the minute before, and who now bowed y{::^he earth before him. 
The officer at the same time handed him the paper. He unfolded it, 
and, as he happened to be near the lamp, he could read : 

“The Judge of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to 
Monsieur Madeleine," 

He crushed the paper in his hands, as if those few words had 
left some strange and bitter taste behind. 

He followed the officer. 

In a few minutes he found himself alone in a kind of panelled 
cabinet, of a severe appearance, lighted by two wax candles placed 
upon a table covered with green cloth. The last words of the officer 
who had left him still rang in his ear : “Monsieur, you are now in 
the counsel chamber ; you have but to turn the brass knob of that 
door and you will find yourself in the court room, behind the 
judge's chair." These words were associated in his thoughts with a 
vague* remembrance of the narrow corridors and dark stairways 
through which he had just passed. 

The officer had left him alone. The decisive moment had arrived. 
He endeavoured to collect his thoughts, but did not succeed. At 
those hours especially when we have sorest need of grasping the 
sharp realities of life do the threads of thought snap off in the brain. 
He was in the very place where the judges deliberate and decide. 
He beheld with a stupid tranquillity that silent and formidable room* 
where so many existences had been terminated, where his own name 
would be heard so soon, and which his destiny was crossing at this 
.moment He looked at, the walls, then he looked at himself, as- 
tonished that this could be this chamber, and that this could be he. 

^ He had eaten nothing for more than twenty-four hours ; he was 
bruised by the jolting of the carriole, but he did not feel it; it 
seemed to him that he felt nothing. 

He examined a black frame which hung on the wall, and which 
contained under glass an old autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache, 



222 L E S M 1 S E E A B L K S 

Mayor of Paris, and Minister, dated, douhlless hy mistake, June 
9th, year IL, in which Pache sent to tiie Oanmunc the list of the 
ministers and deputies held in arrest witlun their limits. ;\ sinnlator, 
had he seen and watched him then, would have iuiaj.;itied* dtnihtless, 
that this letter appeared very remarkable to him, for hr did luu take 
his eyes off from it, and he read it two or three times. ! it‘ was retid- 
ing without paying any attention, anti without kni&gt;\\in^' what he 
ws doing. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette. 

Even while musing, he turned imcotiscmusly, and his eyes en- 
countered the brass knob of the door which separated him in an 
the hall of the aswsizes. He had almost f(&gt;rgt.)! ten that dt h n\ 1 1 is coun- 
tenance, at first calm, now fell. His eves were fixed tm that brass 
knob, then became set and wild and little hy little tilled with dis- 
may. Drops of sweat started out from his head, aiid txdled tlown 
over his temples. 

At one moment he made, with a kind of authority mtittal to re- 
bellion, that indescribable gesture whicli means and which so well 
says: Well! who is there to compel ntef 'hhen he tnnusl ijuickly, 
saw before him the door by whicli he had entereil. wml to it. i^peiuM 
it, and went out. He was no longer in that room ; he was mitside, in 
a corridor, a long, narrow corridor, cut up witli st-ps and si&lt;le* 
doors, making all sorts of angles, liglUt‘d here and there hy lamps 
hung on the wall similar to mirse-lam|is for the sii'k; it Was the 
corridor by which he had come. He drew fueath and listened; no 
sound behind him, no sound heftn'e Itiin; he ran as if lie were 
pursued. 

When he had doubled several of the turns »if this p;tssarte. he 
listened again. There was still the same sihitce an 1 the same sliadovv 
about him. He was out of hreatlt, he trUtered, ite legated a,:ainst the 
wall. Tlie stone wa.s cold; the sweat was iev ujnm his fiU’ehead ; Ie' 
roused himself with a slnidd.er. 

Then and tliere, alone, standing in that rthscurifv, trenihling with 
cold and, perhaps, with s&lt;am*thing else, he retiected. 

He had reflected all night, he iiad rellecterl all rl;iy ; In* now lieard 
Intt one voice within him&gt; whicii said : **Ala^* !’* 

A quarter of an hour thus rolhnt away. Idnallv, he h**wed his 
head, sighed with anguish, kl his anus fail, and rriraceil Ins steps, 
He walked slowly and as if overwhehned* It seemed an if he had 
been caught in his flight and hrmighi liaek. 

He entered tlie counsel chamlier again, The ftrsi thing that he 
saw was tlie handle of the door. That hamlle, round and of f ioUshed 
brass, shone out before him like an orninouH siai% Ik hKikiid ai it n 
a Iamb might look at the eye of a tiger. 

His eyes could not move from it. 

FnW time to time, he took nnmher step inwardH the dour. 

Had he listened, he would have heard, as a kind of confuted 



F A N T I N E 223 

murmur, the noise of the neighbouring hall ; but he did not listen 
and he did not hear. 

Suddenly, without himself knowing how, he found himself near 
the door, he seized the knob convulsively; the door opened. 

He was in the court room. 


IX 

A PLACE FOR ARRIVING AT CONVICTIONS 

He took a step, closed the door behind him, mechanically, and re- 
mained standing, noting what he saw. 

It was a large Hall, dimly lighted, and noisy and silent by turns, 
where all the machinery of a criminal trial was exhibited, with its 
petty, yet solemn gravity, before the multitude. 

At one end of the hall, that at which he found himself, heedless 
judges, in threadbare robes, were biting their finger-nails, or clos- 
ing their eyelids ; at the other end was a ragged rabble ; there were 
lawyers in all sorts of attitudes; soldiers with honest and hard 
faces ; old, stained wainscoting, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with 
serge, which was more nearly yellow than green ; doors blackened 
by finger-marks ; taveim lamps, giving more smoke than light, on 
nails in the panelling ; candles, in brass candlesticks, on the tables ; 
everywhere obscurity, unsightliness, and gloom; and from all this 
there arose an austere and august impression; for men felt therein 
the presence of that great human thing which is called law, and 
that great divine thing which is called justice. ^ 

No man in this multitude paid any attention to him. All eyes 
converged on a single point, a wooden bench placed against a little 
door, along the wall at the left hand of the judge. Upon this bench, 
which was lighted by several candles, was a man between two 
gendarmes. 

This was the man. 

He did not look for him, he saw him. His eyes went towards him 
naturally, as if they had known in advance where he was. 

He thought he saw himself, older, doubtless, not precisely the 
game in features, but alike in attitude and appearance, with that 
fcristling Hair, with those wild and restless eyeballs, with that blouse 
^ust as he was on the day he entered D— % full of hatred, and

The prosecuting attorney, who had seen Madeleine at M sur

three hours, the s|R*ctators had seen a man, an unkiiowni, wretchd 
l&gt;emg, thoroughly .stiit«cl or thnrougldv artfu!, graflyally {iriiidlng 
beneath the weidit of a terrible prolmbility. Thii man, as ii already 



F A N T I N E 225 

known, was a vagrant who had been found in a field, carrying off a 
branch, laden with ripe apples, which had been broken from a tree 
in a neighbouring close called thd Pierron inclosure. Who was this 
man ? An examination had been held, witnesses had been heard, they 
had been unanimous, light had been elicited from every portion of 
the trial. The prosecution said : “We have here not merely a fruit 
thief, a marauder; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an outlaw 
who has broken his ban, an old convict, a most dangerous wretch, 
a malefactor, called Jean Valjean, of whom justice has been long 
in pursuit, and who, eight years ago, on leaving the galleys at 
Toulon, committed a highway robbery, with force and arms, upon 
the person of a youth of Savoy, Petit Gervais by name, a crime 
which is specified in Article 383 of the Penal Code, and for which 
we reserve the right of further prosecution when his identity shall 
be judicially established. He has now committed a new theft. It is a 
case of second offence. Convict him for the new crime ; he will be 
tried hereafter for the previous one.” Before this accusation, before 
the unanimity of the witnesses, the principal emotion evinced by 
the accused was astonishment. He made gestures and signs which 
signified denial, or he gazed at the ceiling. He spoke with difficulty, 
and answered with embarras.sment, but from head to foot his 
whole person denied the charge. He seemed like an idiot in the 
presence of all these intellects ranged in battle around him, and like 
a stranger in the midst of this society by whom he had been seized. 
Nevertheless, a most threatening future awaited him ; probabilities 
increased every moment; and every spectator was looking with 
more anxiety than himself for the calamitous sentence which 
seemed to be hanging over his head with ever increasing surety. 
One contingency even gave a glimpse of the possibility, beyond the 
galleys, of a capital penalty should his identity be established, and 
the Petit Gervais affair result in his conviction. Who was this man ? 
What was the nature of his apathy? Was it imbecility or artifice? 
Did he know too much or nothing at all ? These were questions upon 
which the spectators took sides, and which seemed to affect the jury. 
There was something fearful and something mysterious in the 
trial ; the drama was not merely gloomy, but it was obscure. 

The counsel for the defence had made a very good plea in that 
provincial language which long constituted the eloquence of the 
bar, and which was formerly employed by all lawyers, at Paris as 
well as at Romorantin or Montbrison, but which, having now be- 
come classic, is used by few except the official orators of the bar, 
to whom it is suited by its solemn rotundity and majestic periods ; 
a language in which husband and wife are called spouses, Paris, 
the centre of arts and civilisation, the king, the monarch, a bishop, 
&lt;« holy pontiff, the prosecuting attorney, the eloquent interpreter of 
the vengeance of the law, arguments, the accents which we have

ban, and not the fearful punishment decreed to the convict found 
guilty of a second offence. . 

The prosecuting attorney replied to the counsel for the defence. 
He was violent and flowery, like most prosecuting attorneys. 

He complimented the counsel for his “frankness,” of which he 
shrewdly took advantage. He attacked the accused through all the 
concessions which his counsel had made. The counsel seemed to 
admit that the accused was Jean Valjean. He accepted the admis- 
sion. This man then was Jean Valjean. This fact was conceded to 
the jprosecution, and could be no longer contested. Here, by an 
adroit autonomasia, going back to the sources and causes of crime, 
the prosecuting attorney thundered against the immorality of the 
romantic school — then in its dawn, under the name of the Satanic 
school, conferred upon it by the critics of the Qnotidicnne and the 
Oriflammc; and he attributed, not without plausibility, to the influ- 
ence of this perverse literature, the crime of Champmathieu, or 
rather of jean Valjean. These considerations exhausted, he passed 
to Jean Valjean himself. Who was Jean Valjean? Description of 
Jean Valjean; a monster vomited, etc. The model of all such de- 
scriptions may be found in the story of Thcramcne, which as 
tragedy is useless, but which does great service in judicial elo- 
quence every day. The auditory and the jury “shuddered.” This de- 
scription fini.shed, the prosecuting attorney resumed with an oratori- 
cal burst, designed to excite the enthusiasm of the Journal de la 
Prefecture to the highest pitch next morning. “And it is such a 
man," etc. etc. A vagabond, a mendicant, without means of exist- 
ence, etc.,_etc. Accustomed through his existence to criminal acts, 
and profiting little by his past life in the galleys, as is proved by the 
crime committed upon Petit Gervais, etc., etc. It is such a man who, 
found on the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a 
wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the subject of his 
crime, denies the act in which he is caught, denies the theft, denies 
the escalade, denies everything, denies even his name, denies even 
his identity ! Besides a hundred other proofs, to which we will not 
return, he is identified by four witnesses — ^Javert — the incorruptible 
inspector of police. Javert — and three of his former companions in 
disgrace, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and C'ochepaille, What 
has he to oppose to this overwhelming unanimity ? His denial. What 
depravity! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. 
While the prosecuting attorney was speaking the accused listened 
opened-mouthed, with a sort of astonishment, not unmingM with 
admiration. He was evidently surprised that a man could speik so 
well. From time to time, at the most “forcible” parts of , the argu- 
ment, at those moment# when doquence, uiitbte to cwatain itself, 
overflows in a stream of withering epithet!% and surrounds the 
fHisoner Uke a tempest, he slovi% mov^ Ms bead from right to

again, and suddenly fixing his eyes tipun tin* prusci tiling atiiitney, 
began to speak. It was like an eriipliftii. It seemed fniin the m amier 
in which the words escaped his lips, incoherent, impel utnis, iM- iIing 
each other pell-mell, as if tliey were ;t!I eager to fitul vent at the

good deal. And then the workmen are so bad ! When a poor fellow 
. isn^t young, they always call you old bird, and old beast ! I earned 
only thirty sous a day, they paid me as little as they could — the 
bosses took advantage of my age. Then I had my daughter, who 
was a washerwoman at the river. She earned a little for herself ; 
between us two, we got on ; she had hard work too. All day long up 
to the waist in a tub, in rain, in snow, with wind that cuts your face 
when it freezes, it is all the same, the washing must be done ; there 
are folks who haven't much linen and are waiting for it ; if you don’t 
wash you lose your customers. The planks are not well matched, 
and the water falls on you everywhere. You get your clothes wet 
through and through ; that strikes in. She washed too in the laundr&gt;" 
of the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes in through pipes. 
There you are not in the tub. You wash before you under the pipe, 
and rinse behind you in the trough. This is under cover, and you are 
not so cold. But there is a hot lye that is terrible and ruins your 
eyes. She would come home at seven o’clock at night, and go to bed 
right away, she was so tired. Her husband used to beat her. She is 
dead. We wasn’t very happy, She was a good girl ; she never went to 
balls, and was very quiet. I remember one Shrove Tuesday she went 
•to bed at eight o’clock. Look here, I am telling the truth. You have 
only to ask if ’tisn’t so. Ask! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. 
Who is there that knows Father Champmathieu ? But tliere is M. 
Baloup. Go and see M. Baloup. I don’t know what more you want 
of me.” 

The mail ceased speaking, but did not sit down. He had uttered 
these sentences in a loud, rapid, hoarse, harsh, and guttural tone, 
with a sort of angry and savage simplicity. Once, he stopped to bow 
to somebody in the crowd. The sort of affirmations which he seemed 
to fling out haphazard, came from him like hiccoughs, and he added 
to each the gesture of a man chopping wood. When he had finished, 
the auditory burst into laughter. He looked at them, and seeing 
them laughing and not knowing why, began to laugh himself. 

That was an ill omen. 

The judge, considerate and kindly man, raised his vdice ; ^ 

He reminded ‘‘gentlemen of the jury” that M. Baloup, the. 
former master wheelwright by whom the prisoner said he had bem 
employed, had been summoned, but had not appeared. He had be- 
come bankrupt, and could not be found. Then, turning to the 
accused, he adjured him to listen to what he was about to isay, and 
added : “You are in a position which demands reflection. The grav- 
est presumptions are weighing against you, and may iead^M fatal 
results. Prisoner, on your own behalf , I qeustiom you a second time, 
■explain yourself clearly on these two points. did you or did you 

not climb the wall, of the Pierron close, bresflii-off the branch and

addition of breaking into an inclosure ? Secondl)-, are you or are you 
not the discharged convict, Jean Valjean 

The prisoner shook his head witii a knowing look. like a man 
who understands perfectly, and knows wltal he is going to say. lie 
opened his mouth, turned towards the presiding judge, aiul said : 

“In the first place ” 

Then he looked at his cap, looked up at the eeiling, and was 
silent. 

“Prisoner,” resumed the prosecuting attorney, in an :ius!ere 
tone, “give attention. Yon have replieti to nothing that h.as heen 
asked you. Your agitati(m comfentns you. It is eviiietit tli.at voitr

that you have stolen ripe apples from tlie Piermn dose, with the 
addition of breaking into the inclosure. The g&lt;mtlemeii of ilie jiirv

The accu.sed had at la.st rtvsiiined his seat : he lose aliruptly wiien 
the prosecuting attorney had endcil, and evdainied : 

“You arc a very liad man, you. I mean. This is vvh.it I wauled

lasting nonsense. What is everybody after me for like a mad -dog?” 

The prosecuting attorney was still standing; he addressed the 
judge: 

“Sir, in the presence of the confused but very adroit denegations 
of the accused, who endeavours to pass for an idiot, but who will 
not succeed in it — ^we will prevent him— we request that it may 
please you and the court to call again within the bar the convicts. 
Brevet, Cochepaille, and Chenildieu, and the police-inspector Javert, 
and to submit them to a final interrogation, concerning the identity 
of the accused with the convict Jean Valjean.” 

“I must remind the prosecuting attorney,” said the presiding 
judge, “that police-inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the 
chief town of a neighbouring district, left the hall, and the city also 
as soon as* his testimony was taken. We granted him this permission, 
with the consent of the prosecuting attorney and the counsel of the 
accused.” 

“True,” replied the prosecuting attorney; “in the absence of 
Monsieur Javert. I think it a duty, to recall to the gentlemen of the 
jury what he said here a f ew hours ago. Javert is an estimable man, 
who does honour to inferior but important functions, by his rigor- 
ous and strict probity. These are the terms in which he testified : 1 
do not need even moral presumptions and material proofs to con- 
tradict the denials of the accused. I recognise him perfectly. This 
man's name is not Champmathieu ; he is a convict, Jeaii Valjean, 
very hard, and much feared. He was liberated at the expiration of 
his tei-m, but with extreme regret. He served out nineteen years at 
hard labour for burglary ; five or six times he attempted to esdlpe. 
Besides the Petit Gervais and Pierron robberies, I suspect him also 
of a robbery committed on his highness, the late Bishop of D— . 
I often saw him when I was adjutant of the galley guard at Toulon. 
I repeat it ; I recognise him perfectly.' ” 

This declaration, in terms so precise, appeared to produce a 
strong impression upon the public and jury. The prosecuting attor- 
ney concluded by insisting that, in the absence of Javert, the three 
witnesses, Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille, should be heard 
anew and solemnly interrogated. 

The judge gave an order to an officer, and a moment afterwards 
the door of the witness-room opened, and the officer, accompanied 
by a gendarme ready to lend assistance, led in the convict Brevet 
The audience was in breathless suspense, and all hearts palpitated 
as if they contained but a single soul. 

The old convict Brevet was clad in the black and gref jacket of 
the central prisons. Brevet was about sixty years old ; he had the 
face of a man of business, and the air of a rogue. They sometime!? 
together. He had become something like a turnkey in the prison 
which he had been brought bv neivtmfed^s. He was one 'of

make himself useful/^ The chaplain bore j^ofal ti‘stiint&gt;nv to his re- 
ligious habits. It must not be forgotten that tins happeueil tnuler the 
Restoration. 

“Brevet,” said the judge, “you Ijave sul'hntsl infamosis jninisli- 
Blent, and cannot take an oath.” 

Brevet cast down his eyes. 

“Nevertheless,” continued the judge, “even in the iu:ni u hr&gt;in the 
law has degraded there may remain, if iliyine pr t nut , a senti- 
ment of honour and equity. To that sentinuau 1 in this &lt;le-

look well upon the prisoner; colleet ytmr renaanlaam rs. ;uitl say, 
on your soul and conscience, whetheryou still rr, tirndve man as

Brevet looked at the prisoner, then tttrnrd a’.,:ain to the murt. 

“Yes, your honour, 1 was the jlr-t to manphir !;,irn, ao^S still do 
so. This man is Jean Valjean, who came Tmdoaj in ,md left

“Sit denyn,” said the judge. “Ih'isoiicr, rtnmhn ,

brigandage. Cochepaille was not less uncouth than the accused, and 
appeared still more stupid. He was one of those unfortunate men 
whom nature turns out as wild beasts, and society finishes up into 
galley slaves. 

The judge attempted to move him by a few serious and pathetic 
words, and asked him, as he had the others, whether he still recog- 
nised without hesitation or difficulty the man standing before him. 

“It is Jean Valjean,” said Cochepaille. “The same they called 
Jean-the-Jack, he was so strong.” 

Each of the affirmations of these three men, evidently sincere and 
in good faith, had excited in the audience a murmur of evil augury 
. for the accused — a murmur which increased in force and continu- 
* ance, every time a new_ declaration was added to the preceding one. 
The prisoner himself listened to them with that astonished counte- 
nance which, according to the prosecution, was his principal means of 
defence. At the first, the gendarmes by his side heard him mutter be- 
tween his teeth : “All, well ! there is one of them !” After the second, 
he said in a louder tone, with an air almost of satisfaction, “Good V’ 
At the third, he exclaimed, “Famous !” 

The judge addressed him : 

“Prisoner, you have listened. What have you to say?” 

He replied: , 

“I say — famous !” 

A buzz ran through the crowd and almost invaded the jury. It 
was evident that the man was lost. 

“Officers,” said the' judge, “enforce order. I am about to sura up 
the case.” ^ 

At this moment there was a movement near the judge. A voice 
was heard exclaiming : 

“Brevet, Chenildicu, Cochepaille, look this way !” 

So lamentalde and terrible was this voice that those who heard it 
felt their blood run cold. All eyes turned towards the spot whence it 
came. A man, who had been sitting among the privilege spectators 
behind the court, had risen, pushed open the low door which separ- 
ated the tribunal from the bar, and was standing in the centre of the 
hall. The judge, the prosecuting attorney, Monsieur Bamatabois, 
twenty persons recognised him, and exclaimed at once : 

“Monsieur Madeleine !”

take ; release that man. I am accomplishing a duty ; I am the un- 
happy convict. I am the only one who sees clearly here, and 'I tell 
you the truth. What I do at this moment, God beholds from on high, 
and that is sufficient. You can take me, since I am here. Neverthe- 
less, I have done my best. I have disguised myself under another 
name, I have become rich, I have become a mayor, I have desired 
to enter again among honest men. It seems that this cannot be. In 
short, there are many things which I cannot tell. I shall not relate to 
you the story of my life : some day you will know it. I did rob Mon- 
seigneur the Bishop — that is true ; I did rob Petit Gervais — that is 
true. They wei'e right in telling you that Jean Valj ean was a wicked 
wretch. But all the blame may not belong to him. Listen, your hon- 
ours ; a man so abased as I, has no remonstrance to make with Prov-^ 
idence, nor advice to give to society; but, mark you, the infamy 
from which I have sought to rise is pernicious to men. The galleys 
make the galley-slave. Receive this in kindness, if you will. Before 
the galleys, I was a poor neasant, unintelligent, a species of idiot; 
the galley changed me. I was stupid, I became wicked ; I was a log, 
I became a firebrand. Later, I was saved by indulgence and kind- 
ness, as I had been lost by severity. But, pardon, you cannot com- 
prehend what I say. You will find in my house, among the ashes of 
the fireplace, the forty-sous piece of which, seven years ago, I robbed 
Petit Gervais. I have nothing more to add. Take me. Great God ! 
the prosecuting attorney shakes his head. You say 'Monsieur Made- 
leine has gone mad ;* you do not believe me. This is hard to be borne. 
Do not condemn that man, at least. What ! these men do not know 
me ! Would that Javert were here. He would recognise me 

Nothing could express the kindly yet terrible melancholy of the 
tone which accompanied these words. 

He turned to the three convicts : 

"Well ! I recognise you, Brevet, do you remember — ” 

He paused, hesitated a moment, and said: 

"Do you remember those checkered, knit suspenders that you had 
in the galleys 

Brevet started as if struck with surprise, and gazed wildly at him 
from head to foot He continued : 

"Chenildieu, sumamed by yourself Je-nie-Dieu, the whole of 
your left shoulder has been burned deeply, from laying* it one d^y 
on a chafing dish full of embers, to efface the three letters T* F.' 
which yet are still to be seen there. Answer me, is this true 

"It is true T' said Chenildieu. 

He turned to Cochepaille: 

"Cochepaille, you have on your left arm, near where you have, 
been bled, a date put in blue letters with burnt powder. It is the date 
of the landing of the emperor at Cmnt^fMwch 1815. Lift up

turned her head, and uttered a faint cry. M. Madeleine stood Itefore 
her. He had just come in silently. 

"You, Mon.skur the Mayor!’’ she esclaiineil, 

“How is the {K)or woman ?" he answered in a low voice. 

“PiCttcr just now. Hut we have been very ansimis indeed." 

She e.xplained what had happened, that b’antine h.id been very ill 
the night before, hut was now better, because she Itelieved that'the 
mayor had gone to Montfenneil for her chiUl I he sister dared not 
question the mayor, but .she .saw clearly from his maimer that he ha«l 
not come from that place. 

“That is well," said he. “You did right not to deceive her." 

“Yes,” returned the sister, “but now. Monsieur llie Mavor, when 
she sees you without her child, what shall we tel! her ?'* 

He reflected for a moment, then sai*l. 

“God will inspire us.” 

“But, we cannot tell her a lie," murmureil the sister, in a smoth* 
ered tone. 


The broad daylight streamed into the room, and lighted tji* the 
face of M. Madeleine. 

The sister happened to raise her eves. 

“O God, monsieur." she exclaimed. "Wlwi has liefalleij vo«? 
Your hair is all white!" 

“White!" said he. 

Sister Simplice had no mirror j she rummaKed in a case of instru- 
ments, and fotmd a little glass which the physician of the intirinary 
“fd to discover whether the breath had left the bwly of a patient. 
M^adeleine took the glass, looked at his hair in it, and said, "In- 



F A N T I N E 239 

He spoke the word with indifiference, as if thinking of something 
else. 

The sister felt chilled by an unl^nown something, of which she 
•caught a glimpse in all this. 

He asked : “Can I see her ?” 

“Will not Monsieur the Mayor bring back her child ?” asked the 
sister, scarcely daring to venture a question. 

“Certainly, but two or three days are necessary.” 

. “If she does not see Monsieur the Mayor here,” continued the 
sister timidly, “she will not know that he has returned ; it will be easy 
for her to have patience, and when the child comes, she will think 
naturally that Monsieur the Mayor has just an-ived with her. Then 
we will not have to tell her a falsehood.” 

Monsieur Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments, then 
said with his calm gravity : 

“No, my sister, I must see her. Perhaps I have not much time.” 

The nun did not seem to notice this “perhaps,” which gave an ob" 
scure and singular significance to the words of Monsieur the Mayor, 

She answered, lowering her eyes and voice respectfully : 

“In that case, she is asleep, but monsieur can go in.” ' 

He made a few remarks about a door that shut with difficulty 
the noise of which might awaken the sick woman ; then entered thfi 
chamber of Fantine, approached her bed, and opened the curtains. 

She was sleeping. Her breath came from her chest with that tragic 
sound which is peculiar to these diseases, and which rends the heart 
of unhappy mothers, watching the slumbers of their fated children. 

But this laboured respiration scarcely disturbed an ineffable seren- 
ity, which overshadowed her countenance, and transfigured her in 
her sleep. Her jiallor had become whiteness, and her cheeks were 
glowing. Her long, fair eyelashes, the only beauty left to her of her 
maidenhood and youth, quivered as they lay clo^ upon her che^. 
Her whole person trembled as if with the flutteringof wings which - 
were felt, but could not be seen, and which seemed about to unfeld 
and bear her away. To see her thus, no one could have belieyed that 
her life was despaired of. She looked more as if about to soar away 
than to die. 

The stem, when the hand is stretched out to pluck the flo'^, . 
quivers, and seems at once to shrink back, and present itself* 
human body has something of this trepidation at the moment w^iea " 
the mysterious fingers of d^th are about to gather the sotti, ■ j 

Monsieur Madeleine remained for some time monisanless’ ficdr

done two months before, on the day when be first time

She did not start with surprise or jo&gt;- ; s!n‘ was joy itself. The siin* 
pie question ; “And Cosette?" was asked with stieh deep iaith. with 
SO much certainty, with so ctmifilcle an ahsi*nct* nt disquiet or 
that he could find no -word it' reply. She eontinned : 

“I knew that you were there ; ! was asleep, iiut 1 saw r ou. 1 have 
seen yon for a long time; I have foliowwJ yon with mv eves the 
whole night. You were in a luilo «d' glory, ami all manner ot celestial

He raised his eves towards the enieiliY. 

“Rut tell me, vvlicre is Cosette?" she resumed, m-t j.nt iter 

on my bed that 1 miglit see her the instant 1 wv-ki - : 

He aaswered .soinefhing mechanically, which he tonid tiever 
afterwards recall. 

Happily, the physician had come and had been appi ised ttf this. 
He came to tlie aid" of M . Madeleine. 

“My child,” said he, “he calm, ymir daughter is here." 

The eyes of Fantine heamed with joy, and lighteil up her whole 
countenance. She dasiutd her hands with an e\pn’ss|oi( full of the 
most violent and most gentle entreaty : 

“Oh !” she exclaimed, “bring licr to me !" 

Touching illusion of the mother ; Cosette was still to her a little 
child to be carried in the arms. 

“Not yet," continued the pliy.sidan, "mit at tliis ininneiit. You 
have some fever still. The siglit fit your child will agitate you, .md 
make you wor.se. \¥e must cure you first." 

She interrupted him inipetttously. 

"But I am cured ! I tell you I am curml 1 Is this jihysician a fot*l? 
I will see my child !" 

“You see how you are carrictl away !" said the physician, "So 
long as you are in this state, f cannot let you have your chilil. It is 
not enough to see her, you must live for her. When you are reason* 
able, I will nring her to you myself." 

The poor '.nother bowed her head, 

"Sir, I ask your pardon. I sincerely ask your pardrm. Once I 
would not have spoken as I have now, but so many misfortHucs have 
befallen me that sometimes I do not know what ! am saying. I un- 
derstand, you fear excitement j I will wait at long as you wish, but 



F A N T I N E 241 

I am sure that it will not harm me to see my daughter. I see her now, 
I have not taken my eyes from her since last night. Let them bring 
her to me now, and I will just speak to her very gently. That is all. 
Is it not very natural that I should wish to see my child, when they 
have been to Montf ermeil on purpose to bring her to me ? I am not 
angry. I know that I am going to be very happy. All night, I saw 
figures in white, smiling on me. As soon as the doctor pleases, he 
can bring Cosette. M)r fever is gone, for I am cured ; I feel that 
there is scarcely an3^hing the matter with me ; but I will act as if I 
were ill, and do not stir so as to please the ladies here. When they 
see that I am calm, they will say: ‘You must give her the child.’ ” 

M. Madeleine was sitting in a chair by the. side of the bed. She 
turned towards. him, and made visible efforts to appear calm and 
“very good,” as she said, in that weakness of disease which resem- 
bles childhood, so that, seeing her so peaceful, there should be no 
objection to bringing her Cosette. Nevertheless, although restrain- 
ing herself, she could not help addressing a thousand questions to 
M. Madeleine. 

“Did you have a pleasant journey. Monsieur the Mayor? Oh! 
how good you have been to go for her ! Tell me only how she is. Did 
she bear the j ourney well ? Ah ! she will not know me. In all this time, 
she has forgotten me, poor kitten ! Children have no memory. They 
are like birds. To-day they see one thing, and to-morrow another, 
and remember nothing. Tell me only, were her clothes clean ? Did 
those Thenardiers keep her neat ? How did they feed her ? Oh, if you 
knew how I have suffered in a.sking myself all these things in the time 
of my wretchedness ! Now, it is pa.st. I am happy. Oh ! how I want 
to see her ! Monsieur the Mayor, did you think her pretty ? Is not my 
daughter beautiful ? You must have been very cold in the diligence ? 
Could they not bring her here for one little moment? they might 
take her away immediately. Say ! you are master here, are you will- 
ing?” 

He took her hand. “Cosette is beautiful,” said he. "Cosette is 
well; you shall see her soon, but be quiet. You talk too fast; and 
then you throw your arms out of bed, which makes you cough.” 

In fact, coughing fits interrupted Fantine at almost every word. 

She did not murmur ; she feared that by too eager entreaties she 
had weakened the confidence which she wished to inspire, and be- 
gan to talk about indifferfgrt subjects. 

“Montfermeil is" a pretty place, is it not? In summer people go 
there on pleasure parties. Do the Thenardiers do*a good business ? 
Not many great people pass through that country. Their inn is a kind 
of chop-house.” . . 

Monsieur Madeleine still held her hand and looked at her with 
anxiety. It was evident that he had come to tell her things before

which his mind now hesitated. The physician had tnadr his visit aiid 

i-etirecl Sister Simplice alone remained with ihciu, 

But in the midst of the silence, Fantine crus! tun : 

‘*1 hear her ! Oh, darling' ! I hear her !*’ 

There was a child playing in the court the i hild ni the pnrtress 
or some workwoman. It was one of thoM* chances whicli are always 
met with, and which seem to tnake part of tlu* nivsteriuus re^presen- 
tation of tragic events. The child, which was a litih' girl, was run- 
ning up and down to keep herself warm, singing and langlnjet in a 
loud voice. Alas ! with what are not the jilays ro' children miogltHn 
Fantine had heard this little girl singing. 

*‘Oh V sSaid slie, is my C'osette ! i knmv her voire !’* 

The child departed as she had conn*, and tlic voice died away, 
Fantine listenecl for some lime. A shadow catne over her ne e, and 
Monsieur Madeleine heaol Iut whisper, ”1 tow wi* Ju/d if is of that 
doctor not to let me see my child ! Ilia! man has a Istd face !** 

But yet her happy train of tlamghl retni iu’d. Uiih her heai! on

JAVERT SATISFIED 

Let us see what had happened. ‘ 

The half hour after midnight was striking when M. Madeleine 
left the hall of the Arras Assizes. He had returned to his inn just 
in time to take the mail-coach, in which it will be remembered he 
had retained his seat. A little before six in the morning he had 

reached M sur M , where his first care had been to post his 

letter to M. Laffitte, then go to the infirmary and visit Fantine. 

Meanwhile he had scarcely left the hall of the Court of Assizes 
when the prosecuting attorney, recovering from his first shock, ad- 
dressed the court, deploring the insanity of the honourable Mayor 

of M— — sur M , declaring that his convictions were in no wise 

modified by this singular incident, which would be explained here- 
after, and demanding the conviction of this Champmathieu, who 
was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The persistence of the prose- 
cuting attorney was visibly in contradiction to the sentiment of all — 
the public, the court, and the jury. The counsel for the defence had 
little difficulty in answering this harangue, and establishing that, in 
consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine — ^that is, of |:he real 
Jean Valj ean — ^the aspect of the case was changed, entirely changed, 
from top to bottom, and that the jury now had before them an inno- 
cent man. The counsel drew from this a few passionate appeals, un- 
fortunately not very new, in regard to judicial errors, etc., etc. ; the 
judge, in his summing up, sided with the defence ; and the jury, after 
a few moments' consulation, acquitted Champmathieu. 

But yet the prosecuting attorney must have a Jean Valjean, and 
having lost Champmathieu he took Madeleine. 

Irnmediately upon the discharge of Champmathieu the prosecut- 
ing attorney closeted himself with the judge. The subject of their 
conference was, "'Of the necessity of the arrest of the person of 

Monsieur the Mayor of M sur M- This sentence, in which 

there is a great deal of of, is the jjrosecuting attorney's, written by 
his own hand, on the minutes of his report to the Attorney-general. 

The first sensation being over, the judge made few objections. 
Justice must take its course. Then to confess the truth, although the 
judge was a kind man, and really intelligent, he was at the same 
time a strong, almost zealous royalist, and had been shocked when 
fhe mayor of M— — sur M- — -, in speaking of the debarkation at 
l^nnes, said the Emperor instead oi Buonaparte. 

The order of arrest was therefore granted. The prosecuting at- 
l^ney sent it to M— — sur M— by a cpurier, at full speed, to 
police inspector Javert.

FANTINE 

It was the face of a demon who had again found his victim. 

The certainty that he had caught'jean Valjean at last brought 
forth upon his countenance all that was in his soul. The disturbed 
depths rose to the surface. The humiliation of having lost the scent 
for a little while, of having been mistaken for a few moments con- 
cerning Champmathieu, was lost in the pride of having divined so 
well at first, and having so long retained a true instinct. The satisfac- 
tion of Javert shone forth in his commanding attitude. Thedeformity 
of triumph spread/iver his narrow forehead. It was the fullest de- 
velopment of horror that a gratified face can show. 

Javert was at this moment in heaven. Without clearly defining 
his own feelings, yet notwithstanding with a confused intuition of 
his necessity and his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, 
and truth, in their celestial function as destroyers of evil. He was 
surrounded and supported by infinite depths of authority, reason, 
precedent, legal conscience, the vengeance of the law, all the stars in 
the firmament ; he protected order, he hurled forth the thunder of 
the law, he avenged so'ciety, he lent aid to the absolute; he stood 
erect in a halo of glory ; there was in his victory a reminder of defi- 
ance and of combat ; standing haughty, resplendent, he displayed in 
full glory the superhuman beastliness of a ferocious archangel; the 
fearful shadow of the deed which he was accomplishing, tnarlp vis- 
ible in his clenched fist, the uncertain flashes of the social sword ; 
happy and indignant, he had set his heel on crime, vice, rebellion, 
perdition, and hell, he was radiant, exterminating, sm ili ng; there 
was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous St. Michael. 

Javert, though hideous,, was not ignoble. 

Probity, _ sincerity, candour, conviction, the idea of duty, are 
things which, mistaken, may become hideous, but which, event 
th6ug;h hideous, remain great ; their majesty, peculiar to the human, 
conscience, continues in all their horror; they are virtues with a 
single vice — error. The pitiless, sincere joy of a fanatic in an act of 
atrocity preserves an indescribably mournful radiance which In- 
spires us with veneration. Without suspecting it, Javert, in his fear- 
inspiring happiness, was pitiable, like every ignorant man who wins 
a triumph. Nothing could be more painful and terrible than this 
face, which revealed what we may call all the evil of good. 


IV 

■ AUTHORITY RESUMES ITS SWAY 

iFANTiNE had not seen Javert since the day the mayor had wrested 
f|^r from him. Her sick brain accounted for nothing, only she was 
^re that he had come for her. She could not feridure this hideous 



246 L E s M 1 s f; u A m. k s 

face, she felt as if she were dying, she hid lier face with iMitii hamls 

and shrieked in anguish : 

“Monsieur Muileleine, save me 

Jean Valjean, we sliall call him hy no otiier name iienceforth, 
had risen. He said to Faufine in Ins gentlest :ind e.dmcsl tone : 

“Be composed ; it is not for you tinit he cuines.’’ 

He then turned to Javert aiini saitl : 

“I know what you want.'' 

Javert answered : 

“Hurry along.” 

There was in the manner in which these two words were uttered, 
an inexpressible .stmiething wliich remindeil ymi of a wild beast 
and of a maduian, Javert did nut say "Hurry along!’’ he s,aid; 
“Hurr-’long!'' No orthography can express the tone in which tiiis 
was pronounced; it ceased to Iw human s|W'ech ; it was a howl. 

He did not go through the usual ceicinony ; he made no words; 
he showed n&lt;} warrant. '!’o him jean Valjean was a sort of myster- 
ious and intangible antagonist, a .slunlowv w restler with whom he 
had been struggling for five years, wilhout Iwing able to throw him. 
This nrre.st was not a lieginning, hut an einl. He only said : "Hurry 
along 1" 

While speaking thus, he did not stir a step, but cast nimn Jean 
\’aljean a look like a n*'ose, wiih which hr was accnstoiiied totiniw 
the wretched to him hy force. 

It was the same I&lt;«ik which l'‘antine had felt |ienetrate to the very 
marrow of her hones, two inonihs before. 

.At the exchmuitioii of Javert, I’aiuine h,ad ojK-ned her eyes 
again. But the mayor was tlierc, what could she fear ? 

J.averl advanced to the mbhile of the chamljer, exclaiming : 

“Hey. there ; arc you coming ?" 

The unhappy wo’m.*m lookct! around her. There was no one but 
the mm and the mavor. To whom could this contenipt nous faniilwr- 
ity he ,’tddres.scd ? To herself alone. She shudilered. 

Then she saw a mysterious thing, so mysterinus that its like had 
never apprstred to her in the darkest delirium of fever. 

.•she saw the spy Javert seise Monsieur the Mayor hy the co!I.ari 
she saw .Monsieur the Mayor bow his head. The worUI scemct! van- 
tsliing Iteforc her sight. 

Javert. in fact, liad taken Jean Valjean by the collar. 

Javert Imrst into a horrid laugh, disfdaying all his teeth. 

"There is no Monsieur the Mayor here any longer f" said he. 

Jean \’aljean did hot attempt to diMuit the hand which grasped 
me collar of Ins coat. He siud : 

"Javert — 

Javert interrupted him : "Call toe MmOm ^ Inspector f" 



F A N T I N E 247 

“Monsieur,” continued Jean Valjean, “I would like to speak a 
word with you in private.” 

“Aloud, speak aloud,” said Javert, “people speak aloud to me.” 

Jean Valjean went on, lowering his voice. 

“It is a request that I have to make of you — ” 

“I tell you to speak aloud.” 

“But this should not be heard by any one but yourself.” 

“What is that to me ? I will not listen.” 

Jean Valjean turned to him and said rapidly and in a very low 
tone: 

“Give me three days ! Three days to go for the child of this un- 
happy woman ! I will pay whatever is necessary. You shall accom- 
pany me if you like.” 

“Are you laughing at me !” cried Javert. “Hey ! I did not think 
you so stupid ! You ask for three days to get away, and tell me that 
you are going for this girl’s child ! Ha, ha, that’s good ! That is 
good !” 

Fantine shivered. 

“My child !” she exclaimed, “going for my child ! Then she is not 
here ! Sister, tell me, where is Cosette ? I want my child ! Monsieur 
Madeleine, Monsieur the Mayor !” 

Javert stamped his foot. 

“There is the other now ! Hold your tongue, hussy ! Miserable 
•country, where galley slaves are magistrates and women of the 
town are nursed like countesses! Ha, but all this will be changed; 
it was time 1” 

He gazed steadily at Fantine, and added, grasping anew the 
'Cravat, shirt, and coat collar of Jean Valjean: 

- “I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine, and that there 
Ts no Monsieur the Mayor. There is a robber, there is a brigand, 
,&gt;th€re is a convict called Jean Valjean, and I have got him ! That is 
’what there is 1”, 

t ‘ Fantine started upright, supporting herself by her rigid arms 
td hands ; she looked at Jean Valjean, then at Javert, and then at 
e nun ; she opened her mouth as if to speak ; a rattle came from 
l^r throat, her teeth struck together, she stretched out her arms in 
Mguish, convulsivel)^ opening her hands, and groping about her ' 
Ike one who is drowning ; then sank suddenly back upon the pillow. 
pHer head struck the head of the bed and fell forward on her 
ffeeast, the mouth gaping, the eyes open and glazed. . . 

p&gt;She was dead. ■ ' 

^Mean Valjean put his hand on that of Javert which hdd l^ 
Kined it as he would have opened the hand of a child; then he 

"^&amp;ou have killed this woman.” 

Mpiave done with this!” cried Javert,'f«riotia, “l am not bere to 



248 L E S M I S K 1{ A )i I. !■'. S 

listen to sermons; save all that; the guanl is lK‘liAv; cnnic right 

along, or the handcuffs !” 

There stood in a corner of Ihe room an «ild ivnu iKMisicad in a 
dilapidated condition, wliich the sisters iisetl as a tamp hed when 
they watched. Jean Valjean went to the bed, w rem lird out; the 
rickety head bar— a thing easy for nniseles like his in the twink- 
ling of an eye, and with tiie bar in his clenched irst, hn^lvA at Javert 
Javert recoiled towards the door. 

Jean Valjean, his iron bar in hand, walked shnvly tmvards the 
bed of Fantine. On reuehing it, he turned and sai*! ti» Javert in a 
voice that could scarcely he heanl : 

“I advise 3am not to disturb me imw.” 

Nothing is more certain than that; javert trembled. 

He had an idea of calling the gnanb but Joan K'alji-an might 
profit by his alisence to esca|,)e. I remained, ihrrt'iore. grasped the 
bottom of his cane, and leaned against tlu^ fraiui’wmk of the door 
without taking his eves from Jean \ aljean. 

Jean Valjean rested his elbow upnn the post, ami Ins brad upon 
his hand, and gazed al I'antine, stretelied motiunless bmkjie him. 
He remained thus, mute and absorlH'd, evidently lo-a to everything 
of this life. His conntenanee anti attitiule bespr»ke iiotbing hut im 
expressible pity. 

After a few moments’ reverie, he bent tkoMi to bantine, and ad- 
dressed her in a whisper. 

What did he say? What coult! tins condemned man say to this 
dead woman? What were tliese we»rds? dliey wrw lieard by tame 
on earth. Did the dead woman hear them? dliere aiv touching 
illusions whicli ])erhaps are sublime realities, t hu* thing is beyond 
doubt; Sister Simplice, the only witness of what paNstsl. has often 
related tliat, at the nnnnent when Jean Valjean whi‘^p«’rcd in the ear 
of Fantine, she distinctly saw an imdi'ahle :&gt;tniie beam on tlmse pale 
lips and in those dim eyes, full of tiie womler tu the tomb. 

Jean Valjean took Fantine's head in liis bauds and arranged it 
on the pillow, as a itaaher wnuhl have diaie tur her child, tlum 
fastened the string of her niglu-dress, and r&lt;‘placf d her liuir lic- 
neath her cap. This ilone, he closet! her eytn;, 

The face of Fantine, ai this instant:, seemed sirauf.:e!v illumineil 

Death is the entrance into llie great ligith 

Fantineks hand hung over the side of the lied, jean N'aljcan 
knelt before this hand, raise&lt;l it gently, and kissed it. 

Then lie rose, and, turning to javert, said:

A FITTING TOMB 

Javert put Jean Valjean in the city prison. 

The arrest of Monsieur Madeleine produced a sensation, or 

rather an extraordinary commotion, at M sur M . We are 

sorry not to be able to disguise the fact that, on this single sentence, 
he was a galley slave, almost everybody abandoned him. In less 
than two hours, all the good he had done was forgotten, and he was 
: “nothing but a galley slave.” It is just to say that the details of the 
scene at Arras were not yet known. All day long, conversations like 
this were heard in every part of the town ; “Don’t you know, he was 
a discharged convict!” “He! Who?” “The mayor.” “Bah! Mon- 
sieur Madeleine.” “Yes.” “Indeed!” “His name was not Made- 
leine ; he has a horrid name, Bdjean, Bojean, Bonjean !” “Oh ! bless 
me!” “Pie has been arrested.” “Arrested!” “In prison, in the city 
^ prison to await his removal.”^ “His removal! where will he be 
taken ?” “To the Court of Assizes for a highway robbery that he 
once committed.” “Well! I always did suspect him. The man was 
too good,_too perfect, too sweet. He refused fees, and gave sous 
to every little blackguard he met. I always thought that there must 
be something bad at the bottom of all this.” 

“The drawing-rooms,” above all, were entirely of this Opinion. 

; , An old lady, a subscriber to the Drapeau Blanc, made this re- 
i^nark, the depth of which it is almost impossible to fathom : 
i . “I am not sorry for it. That will teach the Bonapartists !” . 

In this manner the phantom which had been called Monsieur 

Madeleine was dissipated at M sur M- — -. Three or four per- 

i,^ns alone in the whole city remained faitliful to his memory. The 
^Id portress who had been his servant was among the number. 

( 1 the evening of this same day, the worthy old woman was sit- 
in her lodge, still quite bewildered and sunk in sad reflections, 
factory had been dosed all day, the carriage doors were bolted, 
;reet was despted. There was no one in the house but the two 
Sister Perpetue and Sister Simplice, who were watching the 
le of Fantine. 

wards the time when Monsieur Madeleine had been accu^ 
d to return, the honest portress rose mechanically, took the 
&gt;f his room from a drawer, with the taper-stand that used 
jht to light himself up the stairs, then hung the key on a uaH 
which he ted been in Jhe habit of taking it, and pkeed -the 
-stand by its. side, as if she were expecting hfe. She then 
d herself again in her chair, and jeswned ter reflections. The 
old woman’ had done aU this without teinf . c(Mscj&lt;3iis of it. 

&gt;re flian two hours had elapsed when ^tfted from her

wardrobe an old shirt which he tore into* several pieces and in which 
he packed the two silver candlesticks. In all this there was neither 
haste nor agitation. And even while packing the bishop's candle- 
sticks, he was eating a piece of black bread. It was probably prison- 
bread, which he had brought away in escaping. 

This has been established by crumbs of bread found pn the floor 
of the room, when the court afterwards ordered a search. 

Two gentle taps were heard at the door. 

‘‘Come in," said he. 

It was Sister Simplice. 

She was pale, her eyes were red, and the candle which she held 
trembled in her hand. The shocks of destiny have this peculiarity ; 
however subdued or disciplined our feelings may be, they draw 
out the human nature from the depths of our souls, and compel us 
to exhibit it to others. In the agitation of this day the nun had again 
become a woman. She had wept, and she was trembling. 

Jean Valjean had written a few lines on a piece of paper, which 
he handed to the nun, saying: “Sister, you will give this to the 
cure." 

The paper was not folded. She cast her eyes on it. 

“You may read it," said he. 

She read: “I beg Monsieurthe Cure to take charge of all that I 
leave here. He will please defray therefrom the expenses of my 
trial, and of the burial of the woman who died this morning. The 
remainder is for the poor." 

The sister attempted to speak, but could scarcely stammer out a 
few inarticulate sounds. She succeeded, however, in saying : 

“Does not Monsieur the Mayor wish to see this poor unfortunate 
again for the last time?" 

“No," said he, “I am pursued; I should only be arrested in her 
chamber ; it would disturb her." 

He had scarcely finished when there was a loud noise on the 
staircase. They heard a tumult 6f steps ascending, and the old 
portress exclaiming in her loudest and most piercing tones : 

“My good sir, I swear to you in the name of God, that nobody 
has come in here the whole day, and the whole evening ; that I have 
not even once left my door !" 

' A man replied : “But yet, there is a light in this room." 

They recognised the voice of Javert. , . 

The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening covered 
the corner of the wall to the right. Jean Valjean blew out the taper, 
and placed himself in this comer, ^ 

Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table. 

The door opened. ^ 

Javert entered. ; ^

blouse. This might have been the one. 

A last word in regard to Fantine. 

We have all one mother-r-the earth. Fantine was restored to 
this mother. 

The cure thought best, and did well perhaps, to reserve out of 
what Jean Valjean had left, the largest amount possible for the 
poor. After all, who were in question ? — a convict and a woman of 
the town. This was why he simplified the burial of Fantine, and re- 
duced it to that bare necessity called the Potter's field. 

And so Fantine was buried in the common grave of the ceme- 
tery, which is for everybody and for all, and in which the poor are 
lost. Happily, God knows where to find the soul. Fantine was laid 
away in the darkness with bodies which had no name ; she suffered 
the promiscuity of dust. She was thrown into the public pit. Her 
tomb was like her bed. 




COSETTE 




BOOK FIRST— WATERLOO 


I 

WHAT you MEET IN COMING FROM NIVELLES 

On a beautiful moniing in May, last year (1861), a traveller, he 
who tells this story, was journeying from Nivelles towards La 
Hulpe. He travelled a-foot. He was*following, between two rows of 
trees, a broad road, undulating pver hills, which, one after another, 
upheave it and let it fall again, like enormous waves. He had passed 
Lillois vand Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. He saw to the west the slated 
steeple of Braine-l’AlIeud, which has the fonn of an inverted vase. 
He had just passed a wood upon a hill, and at the comer of a cross- 
road, beside a sort of worm-eaten sign-post, bearing the inscription 
— Old Toll-Gate, No. 4 — a tavern with this sign : — The Four 
Winds. Echaleau, Private CafS, 

Half a mile from this taven, he reached the bottom of a little 
valley, where a stream flowed beneath an arch in the embankment 
of the road. The cluster of trees, thin-sown but very green, which 
fills the vale on.one side of the road, on the other spreads out into 
meadows, and sweeps away in graceful disorder towards Braine 
I’Alleud. 

At this point there was at the right, and immediately on the road, 
an inn, with a four-wheeled cart before the door, a great bundle of 
hop-poles, a plough, a pile of dry brush near a quickset hedge, 
some lime which was smoking in a square hole in the ground, and a 
ladder lying along an old shed with mangers for straw. A young 
girl was pulling weeds in a fidd, where a large green poster, prob- 
ably of a travelling show at some annual fair, fluttered in the wind. 
At the comer of the inn, beside a pondi in which a flotilla of ducks 
was navigating, a difficult foot-path lost itself in the shrubbery. 
The traveller took this path. 

At the end of a hundred paces, passing a wall of the fifteenth cen- 
tury, surmounted by a sharp gable qf crossed bricks, he found' 
himself opposite a great arched stone doorway, with rectilinear im- 
post, in the solemn style of Louis XI V, and plaai medallions on 
the sides. Over the entrance ifSts a sevwe faqkde, and a wall per- 
pendicular to the f aqade almost touched ttC doOifway, flanking it at 
; an abrupt right angle. Op the mc?.dpw befbre the door lay three 
: harrows, throegii wdth were blooming, as best they could, all the

flowers of May. The doorway was cli&gt;st*d. It was sho,i i*y uvn t|r-

probably in love, was singing des])eratcly in a tall tree. 

The traveller paused and examined in the stnne at the left « »f the 
door, near the ground, a large circular exea vat inn like the liMllnw of 
a sphere. Just then the folding-doors tijjenetk aiid a peasemt woman 
came out. 

She saw the traveller, and perceivetl what lie was esatniiung. 

'‘It was a Frencli ball which ilid that," said she. 

And she added —

the wood.” 

“What is the name of this place asked the t r.n ellrr

court, the conquest of which was the aspiration of Napoleon This 
bit of earth, could he have taken it, would perhaps have given him 
the world. The hens are scattering the dust with their beaks. You 
hear a giowling : it is a great dog, who shows his teeth, and takes 
the place of the English. 

The English fought admirably there. The four companies of 
guaicls under Cooke held their ground for seven hours, against the 
fury of an assaulting army, 

Hougoniont, seen on the map, on a geometrical plan, comprising 
buildings and mclosure, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one 
coinci of which is cut off. At this corner is the southern entrance 
guarded by this wall, which commands it at the shortest musket 
range. Hougomont has two entrances: the southern, that of the 
chateau, and the noithern, that of the farm, Napoleon sent against 
Hougornont liis brother Jerome, The divisions of Guilleminot, Foy, 
and Bachelu were huxded against it ; nearly the whole corps of Reille 
was there employed and there defeated, and the bullets of Keller- 
mann were exhausted against this heroic wall-front. It was too 
much for the brigade of Bauduin to force Hougomont on the north, 
and the brigade of Soye could only batter it on the south — it could 
not take it. 

^ The buildings of the farm are on the southern side of the court. 
A small portion of the northern door, broken by the French, hangs 
dangling f i om tlie wall. It is composed of four planks, nailed to two 
cross-pieces, and in it may be seen the scars of the attack. 

The northern door, forced by the French, and to which a piece 
has been added to replace the panel suspended from the wall, 
stands halt ojien at the foot of the court-yard ; it is cut squarely in 
a wall of stone below, and brick above, and closes the court on the 
north. It is a simple cart-door, such as are found on all small farms, 
composed of two large folding-doors, made of rustic planks; be- 
Wind this are the meadows. This entrance was furiously contested* 
F()r a long time there could be seen upon the door all sorts of prints 
of bloody hands. It was there that Bauduin was killed. 

/ The storm of the combat is still in this court : the horror is visible 
there ; the overturn of the conflict is there petrified ; it lives, it dies ; 

,it was but yesterday. The walls are still in death agonies ; the stoneS; 

. fall, the breaches cry out ; the holes are wounds; the trees bend and; 

; shudder, as if making an effort to escape. 

This court, in 1815, was in better condition than it is to-day. 
i^Structures which have since been pulled down formed redans, 
|!|iigles, and squares. 

|,v The English were barricaded there; the French effected an en- 
pnance, but could not maintain their position. At the side of the 
gapel, one wing of the chateau, the cnly_ remnant which exists of

Van Kylsom. He was a peasant, who lived in Hougomont, and was 
gardener there. On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and hid 
in the woods. 

The forest about the Abbey of Villiers concealed for several days 
and several nights all that scattered and distressed population. Even 
now certain vestiges may be distinguished, such as old trunks of 
scorched trees, which mark the place of these poor trembling 
bivouacs in the depths of the thickets. 

Guillaume Van K}flsom remained at Hougomont “to take care of 
the chateau,” and hid in the cellar. The English discovered him 
there. He was torn from his hiding place, and, with blows of the 
flat of their swords, the soldiers compelled this frightened man to 
wait upon them. They were thirsty ; this Guillaume brought them 
drink. It was from this well that he drew the water. Many drank 
their last quaff. This well, where drank so many of the dead, must 
die itself also. 

After the action, there was haste to bury the corpses. Death has 
its own way of embittering victory, and it causes glory to be fol- 
lowed by pestilence. Typhus is the successor of triumph. This well 
was deep, it was made a sepulchre. Three hundred dead were 
thrown into it. Perhaps with too much haste. Were they all dead? 
Tradition says no. It appears that on the night after the burial, 
feeble voices were heard calling out from the well. 

This well is isolated in the middle of the court-yard. Three walls, 
half brick and half stone, folded back like the leaves of a screen, 
and imitating a square turret, surround it on three sides. The fourth 
side is open. On that side the water was drawn,. The back wall has 
a sort of shapeless bull’s-eye, perhaps a hole made by a shell. This 
turret had a roof, of which only the beams remain. The iron that 
sustains the wall on the right is in the shape of a cross. You bend 
over the well, the eye is lost in a deep brick cylinder, which is filled 
with an accumulation of shadows. All around it, the bottom of the 
walls is covered by nettles. 

This well has not in front the large blue flagging stone, which 
serves as a curb for all the wells of Belgium. The blue stone is re- 
placed by a cross-bar on which rest five or six misshapen wooden 
stumps, knotty and hardened, that resemble huge bones.. There is 
no longer either bucket, or chain, or pulley ; but the stone basin is 
j^till there^hich served for the waste water. The rain water gidhers 
|here, and from time to time a bird from the neighbouriag forest 
|omes to drink and flies away. ....

grape and of balls ; and Soye's brigade broke there. Waterloo com 
menced thus. 

The orchard, however, was taken. They had no scaling ladders, 
but the French climbed the wall with their hands. They fought hand 
to hand under the trees. All this grass was soaked with blood. A bat- 
talion from Nassau, seven hundred men, was annihilated there. Or 
the outside, the wall against which the two batteries of Kellermann 
were directed, is gnawed by grape. 

This orchard is as responsive as any other to the month of May. 
It has its golden blossoms and its daisies ; the grasS is high ; farm 
horses are grazing ; lines on which clothes are drying cross the in- 
tervals between the trees, making travellers bend their heads ; you 
walk over that sward, and your foot sinks in the path of the mole. In 
the midst of the grass you notice an uprooted trunk, lying on the 
ground, but still growing green. Major Blackmann leaned back 
against it to die. Under a large tree near by f ell the German general, 
Duplat, of a French family which fled on the revocation of the edict 
of Nantes. Close beside it leans a diseased old apple tree swathed in 
a bandage of straw and loam. Nearly all the apple trees are falling 
from old age. There is not one which does not show its cannon ball 
or its musket shot. Skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard. 
Crows fly in the branches ; beyond it is a wood full of violets. 

Bauduin killed, Foy wounded, fire; slaughter, carnage, a brook 
made of English blood, of German blood, and of French blood, 
mingled in fury ; a well filled with corpses, the regiment of Nassau 
and the regiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Black- 
mann killed, the English Guards crippled, twenty French battalions, 
out of the forty of Reille’s corps, decimated, three thousand men, 
in this one ruin of Hougomont, sabred, slashed, slaughtered, shot, 
burned; and all this in order that to-day a peasant may say to a 
traveller : Monsieur, give me three francs; if you like, I will explain 
to you the affair of Waterloo.

THE 18th of JUNE, 1815 

Let us go back, for such is the story-teller’s privilege, and place: 
ourselves in the year 1815, a little before the date of the commence- 
ment of the action narrated in the first part of this book. 

Had it not rained on the night of the 1/th of June, 1815, the futtiafe 
of Europe would have been changed. A few drops of water ifidre ot 
less prostrated Napoleon. That Waterloo should be thf i|nd of Aus- 
terlitz, Providence needed only a little rain, and an fin^asonable 
cloud crossing the sky sufficed for the overthrowicrf a wor^^ 

The battle of Waterloo — ^and this gave^BIil^er timh to come lip^ —

We think not 

His plan of battle was, all. confess, a masterpiece. To march 
straight to the centre of the allied line, pierce the enemy, cut them 
in two, push the British half upon Hal and the Prussian half upon 
Tongres, make of Wellington and Bliicher two fragments, carry 
Mont Saint Jean, seize Brussels, throw the German into the Rhine, 
and the Englishman into the sea. All this, for Napoleon, was in this 
battle. What would follow, anybody can see. 

We do not, of course, profess to give here the history of Water- 
loo ; one of the scenes that gave rise to the drama which we are de- 
scribing hangs upon that battle; but the history of the battle is not 
our sub j ect ; that history moi-eover is told, and told in a masterly way, 
from one point of view by Napoleon, from the other point of view 
by Charras. As for us, we leave the two historians to their contest ; 
We are only a witness at a distance, a passer in the plain, a seeker 
bending over this ground kneaded with human flesh, taking perhaps 
appearances for realities ; we have no right to cope in the name of 
science with a mass of facts in which there is doubtless some mir- 
age ; we have neither the militaty experience nor the strategic abil- 
ity which authorises a system ; in our opinion, a chain of accidents 
overruled both captains at Waterloo ; and when destiny is called in, 
this mysterious accused, we judge like the people, that artless judge*

A 

Those who would get a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo have 
only to lay down upon tlie ground in their mind a capital A. The 
left stroke of the A is the road from Nivelles, the right stroke is the 
road from Genappe, the cross of the A is the sunken road from 
Chain to Braine I’Alleud. The top of the A is Mont Saint Jean, Wel- 
lington is there ; the left-hand lower point is Hougomont, Reille is 
there with Jerome Bonaparte ; the right-hand lower point is La Belle 
Alliance, Napoleon is there. A little below the point where the cross 
of the A meets and cuts the right stroke, is La Haie Sainte. At the 
middle of this cross is the precise point where the final battle-word 
yras spoken. There the lion is ;^laced, the involuntary S3nnbbl of the 
supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard. 

The triangle contained at the top of the A, between the two 
strokes and the cross, is theplateau of Mont Saint Jean, l^e strug- 
gle for this plateau was the whole of the battle. 

The wings of the two armies extended to the light ^ left of the 
two roads from Genappe and from Nivelles j.D’Erlon being op^ 
posite Hcton, Reille opposite Hill. '

Behind the point of the A, behind the plateau oi M&lt;»nt Saint Jean, 

is the forest of Soignes. . .

which has his form. 


THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES 

Everybody knows the first phase of this battle ; the difficult opening, 
uncertain, hesitating, threatening for both armies, but for the Eng- 
lish still more than for the French. 

It had rained all night ; the ground was softened by the shower; 
water lay here and there in the hollows of the plains as in basins ; at 
some points the wheels sank in to the axles; the horses’ girths 
dripped with liquid mud ; had not the wheat and rye spread down by 
that multitude of advancing carts filled the ruts and made a bed un- 
der the wheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys on the sid^ 
of Papelotte, would have been impossible. 

The affair opened late; Napoleon, as we have explained, had a 
habit of holding all his artillery in hand like a pistol, aiming now at 
one point, anon at another point of the battle, and he desired to wait 
until the field-batteries could wheel and gallop ireely ; for this the 
sun must come out and dry the ground. But the sun did not come 
out He had not now the field of Austerlitz. When the first gun was 
fired, the English General Colville looked at his watch and noted 
that it was thirty-five minutes past eleven. 

The battle commenced with fury, more fury perhaps than the 
emperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French at 
Hougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by 
hurling the brigade of Quiot upon La Haie Sainte, and Ney pushed 
the right wing of the French against the left wing of the English 
which rested upon Papelotte. 

The attack upon Hougomont was partly a feint ; to draw Welling- ' 
ton that way, to make him incline to the left ; this was the plan. This 
|)lan would have succeeded, had not the four companies of the Eng- 
lish Guards, and the brave Belgians of Perponcher’s division, reso- 
iutely held the position, enabling Wellington, instead of massing 
.. bis forces upon that point, to limit himself to reinforcing them only 
; fcy four additional companies of guards, and a Brunswick battalion. 

The attack of the French right wing upon Papelotte was intended 
' $0 overwhelm the English left, cut the Brussels road, bar the passage 
lof the Prussians, should they come, to carry Mont Saint Jean, drive 
j’lslck Wellington upon Hougomont, from thence upon BraineJ’Al- 
p||rd, ‘from thence upon Hal; nothing is clearer. With the exception 
Mi a few incidents, this attack succeeded Papelotte was t^ken ; La 
^aie Sainte was carried. /; ■ ■■

iers, before our foimidable infantry, were heroic; their inexperh 
ence bore itself boldly in the affair ; tluw did esiieeirdly good service 
as skii'mishers ; the soldier as a skinnisher, to some extiMit left to 
himself, becomes, so to speak, his own general ; these reeniits ex- 
hibited something of French invention and I'reneli tiny. '1 Ins raw 
infantry showed enthusiasm. That displeased \\ ellingfon. 

After the capture of La Ilaie Sainte, tlie iKittle wavered. 

There is in this day from noon to four o'clock, an obscure inter- 
val; the middle of this battle is alnio.st indistinct, and partakes of 
the thickness of the conllict. Twilight was gathering, ^’ou could 
perceive vast fluctuations in this mist, a giddy mirage, implements 
of war now almost unknown, the. Ikinting colli.acks, the waving .sa- 
bretaches, the cros.scd shoulder-lK'Ils, the grenade cartridge boxes, 
the dolmans of the hussars, the red liuots u ilh a thinisaiul creases, 
the heavy shakos festooned with fringe, the almtisi black infantry 
of Brunswick united with the scarlet inf.antiy nf h iigland, the i’.ng- 
lish soldiers with great white circular pads on their sleeves lor epau- 
lets, the Hanoverian light horse, witli their ohloitg le.athi-r eap with 
copper bands and flowing plumes of red liorse-bair, the .Scotch with 
bare knees and plaids, the large, white gaiters of our grenailiens; 
tableaux, not strategic, lines, the need of .''.alvator Uosa, nut of flri- 
beauval. 

A certain amount of tempest always mingles v. iili a haiile, (}uid 
obscunm, qtikl diviuum. Each historian traces the p.anit idar linea- 
ment which pleases him in this luirly-hutiy . VVliatever may he the 
combinations of the generals, the sltock of armed ma.sses has incal- 
culable recoils in action, the two jilaus of the two le.nlers enter into 
each other, and are disarranged I w each other. Such a |tojiit of the 
battle-field swallows uj) more coniliatants th.m such another, as the 
more or less spongy' soil drinks up w.aler thrown upon it tVister or 
slower. You are ohliged to pour out more soldii'i'N there than you 
thought. An unforeseen (.‘.xpendiliire. The line of hatlie waves and 
twists like a thread ; .streams of hloud ilow reganlle.ss of logic; the 
fronts of the armies undulate ; regimeuts entering or retirim; make 
capes and gulfs; all these .shoals are conlimiaUv .swaying Jimk atitl 
forth before each other ; where infantry w;is, artillerv comes ; where 
artillery was, cavalry nislte.s up; battalions are stnoke. 'I here was 
something there ; look for it ; it i.s gone ; the vistas are displaced : the 
sombre folds advance and recoil : a kind of sepnlchnd w iml pushes 
forwards, crowds back, swells and di.s|terses the.se tragic nntliii titles. 
What is a hand to hand light ? an oscillation. A rigid niatlicmatical 
plan tells the story of a tninute. and not a «tay. To p.aint tt battle 
need.s those mighty painters who have chaos in their touch. Kem- 
brandtis better than yandermculen. Vandcrmculen, essaet at noon,

add that there is always a certain moment when the battle degener- 
ates into a combat, particularises itself, scatters into innumerable 
details, which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, “be- 
long rather to the biography of the regiments than to the Hstory of 
the army.” The historian, in this case, evidently has the right of 
abridgment. He can only seize upon the principal outlines of the 
struggle, and it is given to no narrator, however conscientious he 
may be, to fix absolutely tlie form of this horrible cloud which is 
called a battle. 

* This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particular!}' 
applicable to Waterloo. 

However, in the afternoon, at a certain moment, the battle as- 
sumed precision. 


VI 

FOUR o’clock in THE AFTERNOON 

Towards four o’clock the situation of the English army was seri- 
ous. The Prince of Orange commanded the centre, Hill the right 
wing, Picton the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and 
intrepid, cried to the PIollando-Belgians : Nassau! Brunswick! never 
retreat! Hill, e.xhausted, had fallen back upon Wellington. Picton 
was dead. At the veiy moment that the English had talcen from the 
French the colours of the lOSth of the line, the French had killed 
General Picton by a ball through the head. For Wellington the bat- 
tle had two points of support, Hougomont and La Haie Sainte; 
Hougomont still held out, but was burning; La Haie Sainte had 
been taken. Of the German battalion which defended it, forty-two 
men only survived ; all the officers, except five, wet® dead or prison- 
ers. Three thousand combatants were massacred in that grange. A 
sergeant of the English Guards, the best boxer in England, reputed 
invulnerable by his comrades, had been killed by a little French 
drummer. Baring had been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Sev- 
eral colours had been lost, one belonging to Alton’s division, and one 
to the Luneburg battalion, borne by a prince of the family of Deux- 
Ponts. The Scotch Grays were no more; Ponsonby’s heavy dra- 
goons had been cut to pieces. That valiant cavalry had gpven way bi^ 
fore the lancers of Bro and the_ cuirassiers of Travers ; of theif 
twelve hundred horses there remained six hundred ; of three lieuten- 
ant-colonels, two lay on the ground, Hamilton wounded, Mathet 
killed. Ponsonby had fallen, pierced with seven thrusts of a lance. 
jGordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifffi and the

Wellington, anxious, but impassible, was on horseback, and re- 
mained there the wliole day in the same attitude, a little in front of 
the old mill of Mont Saint Jean, which is still standing, under an 
elm which an Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, has since bought 
for two hundred francs, cut down and carried away. Wellington 
was frigidly heroic. The balls rained down. His aide-de-camp, Gor- 
don, had just fallen at his side. Lord Hill, showing him a bursting 
shell, said : My Lord, what are your instructions, and what orders 
do you leave us, if you allow yourself to be killed ? — To follow my 
example, answei'ed Wellington. To Clinton, he said laconically: 
Hold this spot to the last man. The day was clearly going badly. 
Wellington cried to his old companions of Talavera, Vittoria, and 
Salamanca: Boys! We must not be beat: whatzoould they say of us 
in England! 

About four o’clock, the English line staggered backwards. All at 
once only the artillery and the sharp-shooters were seen on the crest 
of the plateau, the rest disappeared ; the regiments, driven by the 
shells and bullets of the French, fell back into the valley now crossed 
by the cow-path of the farm of Mont Saint Jean ; a retrograde move- 
ment took place, the battle front of the English Ivas slipping away, 
Wellington gave ground. Beginning retreat ! cried Napoleon. 


VII 

NAPOLEON IN GOOD HUMOUR 

The emperor, although sick and hurt in his saddle by a local afflic- 
tion, had never been in so good humour as on that day. Since morn- 
ing, his impenetrable countenance had worn a smile. On the 18th 
of June, 1815, that profound soul masked in marble, shone ob- 
scurely forth. The dark-browned man of Austerlitz wa.s gay at Water- 
loo. Tlte greatest, when foredoomed, present these contradictions. 
Our joys are shaded. The perfect smile belongs to God alone. 

Ridtt C(C.&lt;!ar, Pnmprms fiebit, said the legionaries of the_ Ful- 
tninatrix Legion. Pompey at this time was not to weep, but it is cer- 
tain that Oesar laughed. 

From the previous evening, and in the night, at one o’clock, ex- 
ploring on horseliack, in the tempest and the rain, with Eertrand, 
the hills near Rossomme, and gratified to see the long line of the 
English fires illuminating all the horizon from Frischemont to 
Braine 1‘Alleud, it had seemed to him that destiny, for which he had 
made an appointment, for a certain day UfKin the fiield of Waterloo, 
was punctual ; he stopped his horse, and remained some time mo- 
tionless, watching the lightning and listening to the thunder; and 
this fatalist was h^ard to utter in the darkness these mysterious

grotesque than witty, says Benjamin Constant. These gaieties of a 
giant are worthy of remembrance. He called his grenadiers “the 
growlers he would pinch their ears and would pull their mous- 
taches. The emperor did nothing but play tricks on us; so one of 
them said. During the mysterious: voyage from the island of Elba 
to France, on the 27th of Februaiy, in the open sea, the French 
brig-of-war Zephyr having met the brig Inconstant, on which Na- 
poleon was concealed, and having asked the Inconstant for news 
of Napoleon, the emperor, who still had on his hat the white and 
amaranth cockade, sprinkled with bees, adopted by him in the island 
of Elba, took the speaking-trumpet, with a laugh, and. answered 
himself : the emperor is getting on finely. He who laughs in this way 
is on familiar terms with events ; Napoleon had several of these 
bursts of laughter during his Waterloo breakfast. After breakfast, 
for a quarter of an hour, he collected his thoughts ; then two gen- 
erals were seated on the bundle of straw, pen in hand, and paper on 
knee, and the emperor dictated the order of battle. 

At nine o’clock, at the instant when tire French army, drawn up 
and set in motion in five columns, was deployed, the divisions upon 
two lines, the artillery between the brigades, music at the head, play- 
ing marches, with the rolling of drums and the sounding of trum- 
pets — ^mighty, vast, joyous, — ^a sea of casques, sabres, and bayonets 
in the horizon, the emperor, excited, cried out, and repeated : “Mag- 
nificent ! magnificent !” 

Between nine o’clock and half-past ten, the whole army, which 
seems incredible, had taken position, and was ranged in six lines, 
forming, to repeat the expression of the emperor, “the figure of six 
V’s.” A few moments after the formation of the line of battle, in 
the midst of this profound silence, like that at the commencement of 
a storm, which precedes the fight, seeing as they filed by the three 
batteries of twelve pounders, detached by his orders from the three 
' Corps of D’Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, to commence the action by at- 
tacking Mont Saint Jean at the intersection of the roads from Nivel- 
les and Genappe, the emperor struck Haxo on the shoulder, saying: 
There are twenty-four pretty girls. General. 

Sure of the event, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed be- 
fore him, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had 
:designated to erect barricades in Mont Saint Jean, as soon as the 
tillage was carried All this serenity was disturbed by but a word of 
haughty pity ; on seeing, massed at his left, at a place where there is 
to-day a great tomb, those wonderful Scotch Grays, with their 
Mperb horses, he said: M a 

fi’ . Then he mounted his horse, rode forward from Rossomme, anq 
^se for his point of view a narrow grassy ridge, stt the right of 
road from Genappe to Brussels, whidi was Ws second station 
luring the battle. The third station, that of seven -p’dock. between;

which crosses an undulating plain, often burying itself in the hills 
like a furrow, so that at certain points it is a ravine. In 1815, as now, 
this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont Saint Jean between 
the two roads from Genappe and Nivelles; only, to-day it is on a 
level with the plain ; whereas then it was sunk between high banks. 
It's two slopes were taken away for the monumental mound. That 
road was and is still a trench for the greater part .of its length ; a 
trench in some parts a dozen feet deep, the slopes of which are so 
steep as to slide down here and there, especially in winter, after 
showers. Accidents happen there. The road was so narrow at the 
entrance of Braine I’Alleud that a traveller was once crushed by a 
waggon, as is attested by a stone cross standing near the cemetery, 
which gives the name of the dead, Monsietir Bernard Debrye, mer- 
chant of Brussels, and the date of the accident, February, 1637.^ It 
was so deep at the plateau of Mont Saint Jean, that a peasant, Mat- 
thew Nicaise, had been crushed there in 1783 by the falling of the 
bank, as another stone ci'oss attested; the top of this has disap- 
peared in the changes, but its overturned pedestal is still visible 
upon the sloping bank at the left of the road between La Haie 
Sainte and the farm of Mont Saint Jean. 

On the day o’f the battle, this sunken road, of which nothing gave 
warning, along the crest of Mont Saint Jean, a ditch at the siimmit 
of the escarpment, a trench concealed by the ground, was invisible, 
that is to say terrible.

THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE 

On the morning of Waterloo then, Napoleon was satisfied. 

He was right ; the plan of battle which he had conceived, as we 
have shown, was indeed admirable. 

After the battle was once commenced, its very diverse fortune, 
the resistance of Hougomont, the tenacity of La Haie Sainte, Bau- 
duin killed, Foy put hors de combat, fhe unexpected wall against 
which Soye's brigade was broken, the fatal blunder of Guilleminot 
in having neither grenades nor powder, the miring of the batteries,

At the moment when Wellington drew back, Napoleon started up. 
He saw the plateau of Mont Saint Jean suddenly laid bare, and the 
front of the English army disappear. It rallied, but kept concealed. 
The emperor half rose in his stirrups. The flash of victory passed 
into his eyes. 

Wellington hurled back on the forest of Soignes and destroyed; 
that was the final overthrow of England by France ; it was Cressy, 
Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged. The man of Marengo 
was wiping out Agincourt. 

The emperor then, contemplating this terrible turn of fortune^ 
swept his glass for the last time over every point of the battle-field. 
His guard standing behind with grounded arms, looked up to him 
with a sort of I'eligion. He was reflecting; he was examining the 
slopes, noting the ascents, scrutinising the tuft of trees, the square 
rye field, the footpath ; he seemed to count every bush. He looked 
for some time at the English barricades on the two roads, two large 
abattis of trees, that on the Genappe road above La Haie Sainte, 
armed with two cannon, which alone, of all the English artillery, 
bore upon the bottom of the field of battle, and that of the Nivelles 
road where glistened the Dutch bayonets of Chasse’s brigade. He 
noticed near that barricade the old chapel of Saint Nicholas,

I’Alleud. He bent over and spoke in an under tone to the guide La- 
coste. The guide made a negative sign of the head, probably treach- 
erous. 

The emperor rose up and reflected. Wellington had fallen back. 
It remained only to complete this repulse by a crushing charge. 

Napoleon, turning abruptly, sent off a courier at full speed to 
Paris to announce that the battle was won. 

Napoleon was one of those geniuses who rule the thunder. 

lie had found his thunderbolt. 

He ordered Milhaud's cuirassiers to carry the plateau of Mont 
Saint Jean.

THE UNLOOKED FOR 

They were three thotisand five hundred. They formed a line of half 
a mile. They were gigantic men on colossal horses. There were 
twenty-six squadrons, and they had behind them, as a support, the 
division of Lefebvre Desnouettes, the hundred and six gendarmes 
d'elite, the Chasseurs of the Guard, eleven hundred and ninety- 
seven men, and the Lancers of the Guard, eight hundred and 
eighty lances. They wore casques without plumes, and cuirasses of 
wrought iron, with horse pistols in their holsters, and long sabre- 
swords. In the morning, they had been the admiration of the whole

severx on the first, and six on the second — ^with musket to the 
shoulder, and eye upon their sights, waiting calm, silent, and im- 
movable. They could not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirrassers 
could not see them. They listened to the rising of this tide of men. 
They heard the increasing sound of three thousand horses, the alter- 
nate and measured striking of their hoofs at full trot, the rattling 
of the cuirasses, the clicking of the sabres, and a sort of fierce roat 
of the coming host. There was a moment of fearful silence, then, 
suddenly, a long line of raised arms brandishing sabres appeared 
above the crest, with casques, trumpets, and standards, and three 
thousand faces with grey moustaches, crying, Vive Tempereur ! All 
this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the beginning 
of an earthquake. 

All at once, tragic to relate, at the left of the English, and on our 
right, the head of the column of cuirassiers reared with a frightful 
clamour. Arrived at the culminating point of the crest, unmanage- 
able, full of fury, and bent upon the extermination of the squares 
and cannons, the cuirassiers saw between themselves and the Eng- 
lish a ditch, a grave. It was the sunken road of Chain. 

It was a frightful moment. There was the ravine, unlooked for, 
yawning at the very feet of the horses, two fathoms deep between its 
double slope. The second rank pushed in the first, the third pushed 
in the second ; the horses reared, threw themselves over, fell upon 
their backs, and struggled with their feet in the air, piling up and 
overturning their riders ; no power to retreat ; the whole column was 
nothing but a projectile. The force acquired to crush the English 
crushed the French. The inexorable ravine could not yield until it 
was filled ; riders and horses rolled in together pell-mell, grinding 
each other, making common flesh in this dreadful gulf, and when 
this grave was full of living men, the rest marched over them and 
passed on. Almost a third bf Dubois' brigade sank into this abyss. 

Here the loss of the battle began. 

, A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates, says that two 
thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the sunken 
road of Chain. This undoubtedly comprises all the other bodies 
thrown into this ravine on the morrow after the battle. 

Napoleon, before ordering this charge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, 
had examined the ground, but could not see this hollow road, which 
did not make even a wrinkle on the surface of the plateau. Warned, 
however, and put on his guard by the little white chapel which 
marks its junction with the Nivelles road, he had, probably on the 
contingency of an obstacle, put a question to the guide Lacoste. 
The guide had answered no. It may almost be said that from this 
shake of a peasant's head came the catastrophe of Napoleon. 

Still other fatalities must arise. 

Was it possible that Napoleon should win this battle? We ans^ver

no. Why? Because of Wellington? Bccau.se of Bluchcr? No. Be- 
cause of God. 

For Bonaparte to be conqueror at Walerloo w;i,s ntil in the law 
of the nineteenth century. Another series of facts were preparing in 
which Napoleon had no place. Tlie ill-will tif events had long been 
announced. 

It was tiipe that this vast man should fall. 

The excessive weight of this man in hnni.in destiny disturbed the 
equilibrium. This individual counted, of himself alone, more than 
the universe bc.sidcs. The.se pietlioras of till hmnan viiahiy euneen- 
trated inasingle head, the world mounting to the brain of’one man, 
would be fatal to cmlisation if tluw should endure. The inmnent had

Napoleon had been impeached liefore llu* liiltnile, and his fall was 
decreed. 

He vc.xed God, 

Waterloo is not a Nittle ; it is the change of front of the universe.

Then It was frightful. 

• All sides of the English squares were attacked at once. A whirl- 
wind of frenzy enveloped them. This frigid infantry remained im- 
passible. The first rank, with knee on the ground, received the 
cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second shot them down ; behind 
the second rank, the cannoneers loaded their guns, the front of the 
square opened, m^de way for an eruption of. grape, and closed again. 
‘The cuirassiers answered by rushing upon them with crushing force. 
Their great horses reared, trampled upon the ranks, leaped over the 
bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four living walls. 
The balls made gaps in the ranks of the ctiirassiers, the cuirassiers 
made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared, ground 
down beneath the horses' feet. Bayonets were buried in the bellies 
of these centaurs. Hence a monstrosity of wounds never perhaps 
seen elsewhere. The squares, consumed by this furious cavalry, 
closed up without wavering. Inexhaustible in grape, they kept up an 
* explosion in the midst of their assailants. It was a monstrous sight. 
These squares were battalions no longer, they were craters; these 
cuirassiers were cav^ry no longer, they were a tempest. Each square 
was a volcano attacked by a thunder-cloud ; the lava fought with the 
lightning. 

The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being 
in the open field, was almost annihilated at the first shock. It was 
f ormed of the 75th regiment of Highlanders. The piper in the cen- 
tre, while the work of extermination was going on, profoundly ob- 
livious of all about him, casting down his melancholy eye full of the 
shadows of forest and lakes, seated upon a drum, his bagpipe under 
his arm, was playing his mountain airs. These Scotchmen died think- 
ing of Ben Lothian, as the Greeks died remembering Argos. The 
sabre of a cuirassier, striking down the pibroch and the arm which 
bore it, caused the strain to cease by killing the player. 

The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, lessened by the catas- 
trophe of the ravine, had to contend with almost the whole of the 
English army, but they multiplied themselves, each man became 
equal to ten. Nevertheless some Hanoverian battalions fell back. 
Wellington saw it and remembered his cavalry. Had Napoleon, at 
that vei“y moment, remembered his infantry, he would have won the 
liattle. This forgetfulness was his great fatal blunder. 

Suddenly the assailing cuirassiers perceived that they were as- 
sailed. The English cavalry was upon their back. Before them the 
squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset, with the fourteen hun- 
^^red dragoon guards. Somerset had on his right Dombeig with his 
^Cerman light-horse, and on his left Trip, with the Belgian carbi- 
llieers. The cuirassiers, attacked front, flank, and rear, % infantry 
|iind cavalry, were compelled to face in all directions. What was that 
p&gt; them ? They were a whirlwind. Their valour became unspeakable. 



282 ■ LES MISiRABEES 

Besides, they had behind them the ever thuiKkTin.y; artillery. AI! 
that was necessarj' in order to wound such men in the liack. &lt; Jne of 
their cuirasses,_ with a hole in the left slinulder-plaie made In- a 
musket ball, is in, the collection of the WaKu-luo Mtismini. 

With such Frenchmen only such h’.nglishmeu coulil cope. 

It was no longer a conflict, it was a darkness, a fury, a giddy vurtex 
of souls and courage, a hurricane of .swonl-tlishes. In an instant the 
fourteen hundred horse guards were hut eight hundred ; I’nller 
their lieutenant, fell dea&lt;i. Kky rusheii uj» with the kineers and chas- 
seurs of Lefcbvre-Desnouettes, 'rite plateau of .Mont Saint jean wins

turn to the inkntry, or more correctly, all this terrihle multitude 
wrestled with each other without letting go their hold, 'Hie stjuares 
still held. There were twelve assaults. Ney had four hdi si-s killed 
under him. Half of the cuirassiers lav on the pl.iteau. ’I'liis stnr'trle 
lasted two hours. ^ 

The Engli.sh anny w;is terribly shaken, 'riiere is nmlunVit, if they 
had not been crippled in their first shock by the disaster of the 
sunken road, the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the Centre

spiked .sixty pieces of cannon, and took from the I'liglish regiments 
six colours, which tliree cuirassiers and three eltacseu! s of the iniard 
earned to the emperor before the farm of La llefle AIHam e. ' 

The .situation of Wellington was growing worse. This "stram-c 
battle was like a duel between two wmmded infuriat'-s who wliiic 
yet lighting and resisting, lose till their blood. Which of the two 
shall fall first ? 

The struggle of the plateau continued.

But the enfeeblement of the English appeared irremediable The 
hemorrhage of this army was horrible. Kempt, on the lef win7

WEunderstand the bitter mistake of .Xapoleon : t iroiu liy hoped for, 
Bluchcr arriving; dc,ath instead of life. 

Destiny lias siich turnings. Awaiting the world's itiione, .Saint 
Helena became visililc. 

If tlie little cowboy, who acted as guide to lUihnv, ilUicher's 
lieutenant, had advised him to debonch from the forest above 
Frischeniont mthcr than helow J’lanclicnoii. the sbaiiiiu; of the nine- 
teenth century would iicrhaps have heen ditfeienl. ,\apoleun would 
have won the battle of Waterloo, lly any other road than below. 
Planchenoit, the Prussian army wmilil have brotii’lit up at a ravine 
impassable for artilkrj', tmd Hulmv would tioi have arrived. 

Now, an hour of delay, . as tlu* Prussian general Miiftling declares, 
and Bluchcr woultl not have found Wellington in position ; “the 
battle was lost." 

It was time, we have .seen, tliai Bulow should arrive, lie liad 
bivouacked at Dion Ic Mont, .and started on at dawn. Hut the roadi 
were impractic.able. and his divisbn .stnek in the niire. ‘I'he eannoa 
sank to the hubs in the ruts. Furtlicnnort’, he had in cross tlie Dyle 
on the narrow bridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge 
lead been fired by the French; lire caissoii.s and artillery waggons, 
being unable to pass between two rows of burning houses, had to 
wait till the fire was extinguished. It was nmjti Ivforc Itulow omM 
reach Cliapelle Saint [.amliert. 

Had the action commenced two hours earlier, it would have bee# 
finished at four o’clock, and Bliiclter would have fallen p{mn t 
field already won by Napoleon. Such are these immemc diances, 
proportioned to an infinity, which we cannot grasp. 

As early as mid-day, the emperior, first o( all, with his field glass, 
I^rceived in the e.\tremc horiaon sonvihing which fmeil his atten- 
tion. He said; “I see yonder a cloud which appears to me to be

troops.” Then he asked the Duke of .Dalmatia : “Soult, 'what do 
you see towards Chapelle Saint Lambert?” The marshal, turning- 
his glass that way, answered : “Four or five thousand men, sire. 
Grouchy, of course.” Meanwhile it remained motionless in the haze. 
The glasses of the whole staff studied “the cloud” pointed out by 
• the emperor. Some said : “They are columns halting.” The most 
said: “It is trees.” The fact is, that the doud did not stir. The em- 
peror detached^ Demon’s division of light cavalry to reconnoitre 
this obscure point. 

Bulow, in fact, had not moved. His vanguard was very weak, 
and could do nothing. He had to wait for the bulk of his corps 
d’armie, and he was ordered to concentrate his force before enter- 
ing into line ; but at five o’clock, seeing Wellington’s peril, Bliicher 
ordered Bulow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words : “We 
must give the English army a breathing spell.” 

Soon after the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel 
deployed in front of Lobau’s corps, the cavalry of Prince Willianj 
of Prussia debouched from the wood of Paris, Planchenpit was ia 
flames, and the Prussian balls began to rain down even in die ranks 
of the guard in reserve behind Napoleon. 


XII 

THE GUARD 

The rest is known ; the irruption of a third army, the battle thrown 
out of joint, eighty-six pieces of artillery suddenly thundering 
forth, Pirch the First coming up with Bulow, Ziethen’s cavalry led' 
by Bliicher in person, the French crowded back, Marcognet swept 
from the plateau of Ohain, Durutte dislodged from Papelotte, 
Donzelot and Quiot recoiling, Lobau taken en ectorpe, a new battle 
falling at night-fall upon our dismantled regiments, the whole 
English line assuming the offensive and pushed forward, the gigan- 
tic gap made in the French army, the English grape and the Prus- 
sian grape lending mutual aid, extermination, disaster in front, 
disaster in flank, the guard entering into line amid this terrible 
crumbling. 

» Feeling that they were going to their death, they cried out : 
Vive I’Empereur! There is nothing more touching in history th«a 
'-,&amp;is death-agony bursting forth in acclamations. 

P he sky had been overcast all day. All at once, at this very mo- 
t — it was eight o’clock at night— the clouds in the horizon 
||irotce, and through the elms on the Nivelles road streamed the; 
P^ister red light of the setting sun. The rising sun shone upon

friends slay each other in their flight ; squadrons and battalions are 
crushed and dispersed against each other, enormous foam of the 
battle._Lobau at one extremity, like Reille, at the other, is rolled 
away in the flood In vain does Napoleon make walls with the re- 
mains of the guard ; in vain does he expend his reserve squadron in 
a last ettort. Quiot gives way before Vivian, Kellermann before 
Vandeleur, Lobau before Bulow, Moraud before Pirch, Domon 
and Lubervic before Prince William of Prussia. Guyot, who had 
led flie emperors squadrons to the charge, falls under the feet of 
me English horse. Napoleon gallops along the fugitives, harangues 
them, urges, threatens, entreats. The mouths, which in the morning 
were c^mgmve I Empereur, are now agape; he is hardly recog- 
msed. The Prussian cavalry, just come up, spring forward, fling 
^emselves upon the enemy, sabre, cut, hack, kill, exterminate. 
Teams rush off, the guns are left to the care of themselves ; the 
soldiers of the tram unhitch the caissons and take the horses to 
escape ; waggons upset, with their four wheels in the air, block up 
the road and are accessories of massacre. They crush and thev 
crowd ; they Sample upon the living and the dead. Arms are broken. 
A multitude fills roads, paths, bridges, plains, hills, valleys, woods, 
choked up by this flight of forty thousand men. Cries, despair, knap- 
sacks and muskets cast into the rye, passage forced at the point of 
the sword ; no more comrades, no more officers, no more generals: 
inexpressib^ dismay. Ziethen sabring France at his ease. Lions be^ 
come kids. Such was this flight. 

At Genappe there was zn effort to turn back, to form a line, to 
make a stand. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entrance to 
the village was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian grape, 
all took to flight again,_and Lobau was .captured. The marks of that 
volley of grape are still to be seen upon the old gable of a brick 
i^in at tl^ right of the road, a short distance before entering 
Genappe. The Prussians rushed into Genappe, furious, doubtless, 
at having conquered so little. The pursuit was monstrous. Bliichei 
|;ave orders to kill all, Roguet had set tliis sad example by threaten- 
mg with death every French grenadier who should bring him a 
Prussian prisoner. Bliicher surpassed Roguet. The general of the 
Young Guard, Duhesme, caught at the door of a tavern in Genappe, 

g ive TO his sword to a Hussar of Death, who took the sword and 
lied the prisoner. The victory was completed by the assassination 
blthe vanquished. Let us punish, since we are history : old Bliicher 
^graced himself. This Terodty filled the disaster tb the brim. The 
psperate rout passed through Genap^ie, passed through Quatre

A FEW squares of the guard, inimovalde in tlie tlow t»f tlie rmit .ts 
socks in running water, held out unlii night. N iglii appma* bing. and 
death also, they waited fhi.s doulde shadow, and vii-lde*l uiif.diiTiiig, 
to its embrace. Each regiment, isolatctl from the others, and having 
no further communication witli tlie armv, which was liroken in all 
diceefions, was dying alone. They had taken position, for this last 
^niggle, some upon the heights of Ho-ssomme, olhcr.s in the plain of 
Mont Saint Je?in. There, abandoned, conquered, terrihie, these 
»mbrt‘ .squares suffered formidable martyrdom, t '1111, W'agrain, 
Jena, I'Viedland, were dying in them. 

At du.sfc, toward.s nine o'clock in the evening, stt the foot of the 
plateau of Mont Saint Jean, there remained hiii one. In this fata! 
valley, at the bottom of that slope which had Iwn cHmlied by the 
cuicwsiers, mandated now by the English masses, under thc con- 
yergmg fire of the victoriotis artillery of the enemy, under a fright- 
ful storm of projectiles, this square ftmght on. It was commanded 



COSETTE 289 

by an obscure officer whose name was Cambronne. At every dis- 
charge, the square grew less, but returned the fire. It replied to 
grape by bullets, narrowing in its four walls continually. Afar off 
the fugitives, stopping for a moment out of breath, heard in the 
darkness this dismal thunder decreasing. 

When this legion was reduced to a handful, when their flag; was 
reduced to a shred, when their muskets, exhausted of ammunition, 
were reduced to nothing but clubs, when the pile of corpses was 
larger than the group of the living, there spread among the con- 
querors a sort of sacred terror about these sublime martyrs, an^ 
the English artillery, stopping to take breath, was silent. It was a 
kind of respite. These combatants had about them, as it were, a 
swarm of spectres, the outlines of men. on horseback, the black 
profile of the cannons, the white sky seen through tlie wheels and 
the gun-carriages ; the colossal death’s head which heroes always 
see in the smoke of the battle was advancing upon them, and glar- 
ing at them. They could hear in the gloom of the twilight the load- 
ing of the pieces, the lighted matches like tigers’ eyes in the pi^ 
made a circle about their heads; all the linstocics of the English 
batteries approached the guns, when, touched by their heroi^, 
holding the death-moment suspended over these men, an Engli^ 
general, Colville, according to some, Maitland, according to others, 
cried to them: "Brave Frenchman, surrender!” Cambronne an- 
swered: “Aferde/”

CAMBRONNE 

Out of respect to the French reader, the finest word, perhaps, that 
a Frenchman ever uttered cannot be repeated to him. We are pro- 
hibited from embalming a sublimity in history. 

; At our own risk and peril, we violate that prohibition. 

Among these giants, then, there was one Titan — Cambronne. 

To speak that word, and then to die, what could be more grand I 
for to accept death is to die, ^d it is not the fault of this man, if. 
Ip the storm of grape, he survived. 

The man who won the battle of Waterloo is not Napoleon put t® 
vf out ; nor Wellington giving way at four o’clock, desperate at five; 
fj^t Bliicher, who did not fight; the man who won the battle of 
i^aterloo was Cambronne. , ,

Bliicher, to be ironical in the sepulchre, to act so as to remain up-

European coalition, to offer to kings these ju iyiiies alreadv known 
to the Csesars, to make the last of words the first, liv .assoeiating it 
with the glory of France, to cln.se Waterloo insnlently by .a .M.ardi 
Gras, to complete Leonidas by Rabelais, to sum up this victory in a 
supreme word which cannot be pronounced, to lose the field, and to 
preserve history, after this carn.age to have llie laugh on his side, 
IS immense. 

It is an in.sult to the thnnderlKilt. Tliat attains the gr.aiuieitr of 
'.iEschylus. 

This word of Cambronne’s gives the effect of a fracture. It is 
the breaking of a heart liy scorn ; it is an overplus of agony in ex- 
plosion. Who conquered? Welliiiglou? Xo. W ithout I’.liicher he 
would have been lo.st. BUicher? X'n. If \Ve!rin;;(on li.ad not com- 
menced, Bliicher could not have finished, 'i'liis t'anilironne, this 
passer at the la.st hour, this unknown soldirr, this infmiiesiiii.al of 
war, feels that there is there a He in a ea last top! le, doubly hitter; 
and at the moment when he is bursting with rage, he is offered this 
mockery — life? How can he restrain liimself ? They are there, all 
the kings of Europe, the fortunate generals, the tlmndeiing joves, 
they have a hundred thousand victorious soMiers, ;tnd beitind the 
hundred thousand, a million ; their guns, with inatclies lighted, are 
agape; they htive the Imperial Guard atul the « Ir.aiti! .Xrmy under 
their feet; they have crushed Napttleon, ami I’attibronne only re- 
mains; there is none but this worm of the e.artlt to protest. He will 
protest. Then he .seeks for a word tis one seelss for a sword. He 
froths at the mouth, and this froth is the word. Before this mean 
and monstrous victory, before tliis victory without victors, this 
desperate man straightens him.self up, he suffers its enornniy, but 
he establi.slies its nothingness; and he does more tliaii spit upon iti 
and overwhelijied in numbers ami material .strength he finds in the 
soul an expression— ordure. We n-peat it. to .‘lay that, to do that, to 
find that, is to be the conqueror. 

The soul of great days entered into this imkmnvn ni.ari :it that 
moment of death. Cambronne finds the word of Waterloo, as 
Rouget de risle finds the Mar.sei!laise, throngit a sniim ior !ns]&gt;ira- 
tion. An cfiltience from the divine afflatus detaches itself, .md 
passes over these men, and they tremble, ami tin* one sines the 
.supreme song, and the other utters the terrilile erv. d his word of 
titanic scorn Cambronne throws down not merely to l-;uro}ie, in 
the name of the h-mpire, that would lie but lilfle ; he throws it down 
to the past, in the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and men 
recognize in Cambronne the oltl .sou! of the giants. It seems as if it 
were a speech of Danlon. or a roar of Kieber. 



C O S E T T E 291 

To this word of Cambronne, the English voice replied: “Fire!” 
the batteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen throats, 
went forth a final vomiting of'grape, terrific; a vast smoke, duslcy 
white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the 
smoke was dissipated, there was nothing left. That formidable 
remnant was annihilated ; the guard was dead. The four walls of 
the living redoubt had fallen, hardly could a quivering be distin- 
guished here and there among the corpses ; and thus the French 
legions, grander than the Roman legions, expired 2tt Mont Saint 
Jean on ground soaked in rain and blood, in the sombre wheat-fields, 
at the spot where now, at . four o’clock in the morning, whistling, 
and gaily whipping up his horse, Joseph passes, who drives the 
mail from Nivelles.

S^UOT LIBRAS IN DUCE? 

The battle of Waterloo is an enigma. It is as obscure to those who 
won it as to him who lost it. To Napoleon it is a panic; ^ Bludier 
sees in it only fire ; Wellington comprehends nothing of it. Look 
at the reports. The bulletins are confused, the commentaries are 
foggy. The former stamner, the latter falter. Jomini separates the 
battle of Waterloo into four periods ; Muffling divides it into three 
tides of foi'tune; Charras alone, though upon some points our 
appreciation differs from his, has seized with his keen glance the 
characteristic lineaments of that catastrophe of human genius 
struggling with divine destiny. All the other historians are blinded 
by the glare, and are groping about in that blindness. _A day of light- 
nings, indeed, the downfall of the military monarchy, which, to the 
great amazement of kings, has dragged with it all kingdoms, the 
fall of force, the overthrow of war. 

In this event, bearing the impress of superhuman necessity, man’s 
part is nothing, 

Does taking away Waterloo from Wellington and from Blucher,' 
detract anything from England and Glermany? No. Neither illustri- 
ous England nor august Germany is in question in the problem of 
Waterloo. Thank heaven, nations are great aside from the dismal 
chances of the sword. Neither Germany, nor England, nor France, 
is held in a scabbard. At this day when Waterloo is only a clicking 
of sabres, above Blucher, Germany has Goethe, and above' Welling- 
ton, England has Byroii. A vast uprising of ideas is.peculiar toour 
century, and in this aurora England and Germany l&amp;ve a. niagnifi:-

having everything against him, nothing for him, with no provisions, 
no munitions, no cannon, no shoes, almost without an army, with a 
handful of men against multitudes, rushed upon allied Europe, 
and absurdly gained victories that were impossible ? Whence came 
•this thundering madman who, almost without taking breath, and 
with the same set of the combatants in hand, pulverised one after 
the other the five armies of the Emperor of Germany, overthrow- 
ing Beaulieu upon Alvinzi, Wurmser upomBeaulieu, Melas upon 
Wurmser, Mack upon Melas ? Who was this new-comer in war with 
the confidence of destiny? The academic military school excom- 
municated him as it ran away. Thence an implacable hatred of the 
old system of war against the new, of the correct sabre against the 
flashing sword, and of the chequer-board against genius. On the 18th 
of June, 1815, this hatred had the last word, and under Lodi, Monte- 
bello, Montenotte, Mantua, Marengo, Areola, it wrote : Waterloo. 
Triumph of the commonplace, grateful to majorities. Destiny con- 
sented to this irony. In his decline, Napoleon again found Wurmser 
before him, but young. Indeed, to produce Wurmser, it would have 
been enough to whiten Wellington's hair. 

Waterloo is a battle of the first rank won by a captain of the 
second. 

What is truly admirable in the battle of Waterloo is England, 
English firmness, English resolution, English blood; the superb 
, thing which England had there — ^may it not displease her — ^is her- 
self . It is not her captain, it is her army. 

Wellington, strangely ungrateful, declared in a letter to Lord 
Bathurst that his army, the armythat fought on the 18th of June, 
1815, was a ^^detestable army/' What does this dark assemblage of 
bones, buried beneath the furrows of Waterloo, think of that ? 

England has been too modest in regard to Wellington. To make 
Wellington so great is to belittle England. Wellington is but a hero 
like the rest. These Scotch Grays, these Horse Guards, these regi- 
ments of Maitland and of Mitchell, this infantry of Pack and 
Kempt, this cavalry of Ponsonby and of Somerset, these High- 
landers playing the bagpipe under the storm of grape, these battal- 
ions of Rylandt, these raw recruits who hardly knew how to handle 
a musket, holding out against the veteran bands of Essling and 
Rivoli — -all that is grand, Wellington was tenacious, that was his 
merit, and we do not undervalue it, but the least of his foot-soldiers 
or his horsemen was quite as firm as he. The iron soldier is as good 
as the Iron Duke. For our part, all our glorification goes to the Eng- 
lish soldier, the English army, the English people. Tf trophy there 
be, to England the trophy is due. The Waterloo column would be 
more just if, instead of the figure of a man, it lifted to the clouds 
the statue of a nation. 

But this great England will be oifended at what we say here.

She has still, after her 1688 and our 1789, the ieiulal illusion. She 
believes in hereditar}r right, and in the hierarchy. This peoide, sur- 
passed by none in might and glory, esteems itselt as a natu)n, not 
as a people. So much so that as a people they suhonlinatc them- 
selves willingly, and take a Lord for a head. Workmen, they submit 
to be despised; soldiers, they submit to be whipped. We rememlKtr 
that at tlie battle of Inkerman a sergeant who, as it apiie.arefl, had 
saved the army, could not be mentioned by J-ord Kaglan, the 
English military hierarchy not permitting anj' hero below the rank 
of officer to be spoken of in a report. 

What we admire above all, in an encounter like tliat of Waterloo, 
is the prodigious skill of fortune, 'bhe night’s rain, tlie wall of 
Hougomont, the .sunken road of Oluiin, tlrouehy deaf to eaminn, 
Napoleon's guide who deceives him, lUilow’s guitle who U-uds him 
right; all this cataclysm is wonderfully e.arried out. 

Taken as a whole, let us .say, Waterloo was more of a massacre 
than a battle. 

Of all great battles, Waterloo is that which h.as the shortest line 
in proportion to the number engaged. Najwileon. two miles, Well- 
ington, a mile and a half ; seventy-two thousand men on each side. 
From this density came tlie carnage. 

The calculation has been made aiul this prfipoiiitin established: 
Loss of men: at Au.sterlitz, I’rench, fourteen per cent.; Kussiaus, 
thirty per cent.; Austrians, forty-four per cent. At Wagram, 
French, thirteen per cent.; Austrians, fourteen. At La Mo-scowa, 
French, thirty-.seven per cent. ; Russians, forty- four. At Rautzen, 
French, thirteen per cent.; Russians and Prussians, fourteen. At 
Waterloo, French, fifty-six per cent.; Allies, ihirty-oue. Average 
for Waterloo, forty-one per cent. A hundred aiu! forty-four thou- 
sand men ; sixtjf thousand dead. 

The field of Waterloo to-day has that calm which IteUuigs to the 
earth, impa,s.sive support of man ; it resembles any otlier pbiin. 

At night, however, a sort of visitmary mist arises front it, and 
if some traveller be walking tliere. if he looks, if he listens, if he 
dreams like Virgil in the fatal plain of Philippi, he hetojnes |io.s- 
.ses.secl by the hallucination of the «Hs:ister. 1 lie terrible IKth of 
June is again before him ; the artificial hill of the mominumt fades 
away, tliis lion, whatever it he, is dispclknl ; the field of hatllt* re- 
sumes its reality ; the !inc.sof infantry undulate in the plain, itirious 
gallops traver.se the horizon ; the Inwikiered t!re.‘nner sees the (lash 
of sabres, the gli.stening of bayonets, the bursting of shells, the 
awful intermingling of the thundens; he hears, like a &lt;le:ilh-raltlc 
from the depths of a tomb, the vague clamour t»( the phantom 
battle; these .sh.adows are grenadiers; these gleaias are cuirassiers; 
this .skeleton is Napedeon; that skeleton is WdUni'tori; all this is 
unreal, and yet it clashes and coinlatts ; and the ravines run rctl, and

darkness, all those savage heights, _Mont Sain Jean, Hougomont,

with whirlwinds of spectres exterminating each other.

MUST WE APPROVE WATERLOO ? 

There exists a very respectable liberal school, which does not hate 
Waterloo. We are not of them. To us Waterloo is but the uncon- 
scious date of liberty. That such an eagle should come from such aq 
egg, is certainly an unlooked-for thing. ( 

Waterloo, if we place ourselves at the culminating point of view 
of the question, is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. 
It is Europe against France ; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna 
against Paris ; it is the status quo against the initiative ; it is the 14tb 
of June, 1789, attacked by the 20th March, 1815; it is the mon- 
archies clearing the decks for action against indomitable French 
uprising. The final extinction of this vast people, for twenty-six 
years in eruption, sucli was the dream. It was the solidarity of the . 
Brunsiwicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzpllerns, and the 
Hapsburgs, with the Bourbons. Divine right rides behind with Water 
loo. It is true that the empire having been despotic, royalty, by the 
natural reaction of things, was forced to become liberal, and also 
that a constitutional order has indirectly sprung from Waterloo, to 
the great regret of the conquerors. The fact is, that revolution can- 
not be conquered, and that being providential and absolutely de- 
creed, it reappears continually, before Waterloo in Bonaparte, 
throwing down the old thrones, after Waterloo in Louis XVIII., 
granting and submitting to the charter. Bonaparte places a postillion 
on the throne of Naples and a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, 
employing inequality to demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. at 
Saint Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights of man. 
Would you realise what Revolution is, call it Progress ; and would 
you realise what Progress is, call it To-morrow. To-morrow per- 
forms its work irresistibly, and it performs it from to-day. It al- 
Ways reaches its aim through unexpected means. It employe We$- 
ington to make Foy, who was only a soldier, an orator. Foy fall® a4 ;

the time of the thinkers has come. The age which W'aterlnu would 
have checked, has marched on and pursued its course, Tliis in-

triumphantly on that pede.stal this date: June ISth, 1.S15; that 
which encouraged Blitcher sabering the fugitives ; that which, from 
the height of the plateau of Mont Saint Jean, hung over I'rance as 
over a prey, was Counter-revolution, if was t'oimtcr-revoliitinii

The empire iwink into ti darkness which resembled fb;it of the 
expiring Roman world. It rose again from tlu&gt;i!ej&gt;tbs. as in tlu* fiinc 
of the Baiimrians. Only, the barbarism of 181, \ which should l.e 
called by its special name, the counter-fevoltilion, was short- 
winded, .soon out of breafii, and .soon .stOjUH'd. The entjiire, we must

real day, it is night. This disappearance (if niglit had the effect of 
an eclipse. 

Louis XVIII. returned to Ikaris. Tlie dancing in a ring of tlie 
8th of July effaced the enthusiasm of the 2fJth of March. The Cor- 
stcan became the antithesis of the Ilearnoi.s. The Hag of the dome 
of the Tuileries was white. The exile mounted the throne, 'rhe fir

fraternised majestically. One of the most unquestionably safe 
fonns of society in the nineteenth century was established in 
France and on the Continent. Europe put on the white cockade. 
Trestaillon became famous. The device non pluribus intpar reap- 
peared in the radiations on the faqade of the barracks of the quay 
of Orsay. Where thei-e had been an imperial guard, there was a red 
house. The arc du Carrousel, — covered with awkwardly gained vic- 
tories, — disowned by these new times, and a little ashamed, per- 
haps, of Marengo and Areola, extricated itself from the affair by 
the statue of the Duke of Angoulcme. The cemetery de la Made- 
leine, the terrible Potter’s field of ’93, was covered with marble and 
jasper, the bones of Louis XVI. and Marie- Antoinette being in this 
dust. In the ditch of Vincennes, a sepulchral column rose from the 
ground, recalling the fact that the Duke of Enghien died in the 
same month in which Napoleon was crowned. Pope I ius VII., who 
had performed this consecration very near the time of this death, 
tranquilly blessed the fall as he had ble.ssed the elevation. At Schoen- 
brunn there was a little shadow four years old which it was seditious 
to call the King of Rome. And these things were done, and these 
kings resumed their thrones, and the master of Europe was put in 
a cage, and the old n'p'iine became the new, and all the light and 
shade of the earth ch:inged place, bcause, in the afternoon of a sum- 
mer’s day, a cowboy said to a Prussian in a wood: “Pass this way 
and not that !’’ 

This 1815 was a sort of gloomy April. The old unhealthy and 
pC)i.sonous realities took on new shajics. Falsehood espouse 1 1789, 
divine right masked itself under a charter, fictions became consti- 
tutional, prejudices, supenstitions and mental reservations, with 
article 14 hugged to the heart, put on a varnish of liberalism. Ser- 
pents changing their skins. 

Man had been at once made greater and made less by Napoleon. 
The ideal, under this splendid materia! reign, had received the 
strange name of ideology. Serious recklessness of a great man, to 
turn the future into derision. The people, however, that food for 
cannon .so fond of the cannoneer, looked for him. Where is he? 
What is he doing? “Napoleon is dead,” said a visitor to an invalid 
of Marengo and Waterloo. “He dead!" cried the soldier; “areyoie 
sure of thaif’ Imagination defied this prostrate man. The heart of 
Europe, after Waterloo, was gloomy. An enormous void remained* 
long after the disappearance of Napoleon. 

Kings threw themselves into this void. Old Euro]^ profitd^ by 
it to assume a new form. There was a Alliance. Bale Alliansoe

it. Strange to tell, men became enamourcii ui tiu! same time of 
this future, Liberty, and of this past, Xapoletm. Lefeat had mag- 
nified the vanquished. Bonaparte fallen seemed higher than Ihma- 
parte in power. Those who liad triumpheth were struck with fear. 
England guarded him through 1 fiulsou Lowe, an&lt;l h’ ranee watched 
him through Montchemi. Ills folded arms hecame the anxiety of

something of their peace spreail over the world. 'I'he congress of

THK FIELD OK BATTLE AT NHOrr 

We return, for it is a requirement &lt;»f this hook, to the fatal field 
of battle. 

On the 18th of June, 1815, the moon was full. Its light favoured 
the ferocious pursuit of Bliicljer, disclosed the traces of the fugi- 
tives, delivered this helpless mass to the hltiodthirsty Prussian 
cavalry, tml aided in the ma.s.sacre. Xigdd sometimes lends such 
tragic assistance to catastrophe. 

When the last gun had hecit liretl the plain of Mtmi Saint |ean 
remained deserted.

ification of victory to sleep in the tier! of the v;m»{uisiiefi T\wv es-

If ever the sic tms non vobis were a|jpliathle, ti is surely lo this 
village of Waterloo. Waterloo did nothing, aiid was two luiks dis- 
tant from the action. Mont Saint Jean was Cfiiiiit»iia«!ed, Hougornont

COSET TE 299 

Sainte was taken by assault, La Belle Alliance witnessed the meet- 
ing of the two conquerors ; these names are scarcely known, and 
Waterloo, which had nothing to do with the battle, has all the 
honour df it. 

We are not of those who glorify war ; when the opportunity pre- 
sents itself we describe its realities. War has frightful beauties 
which we have not concealed ; it has also, we must admit, some de- 
formities. One of the most surprising is the eager spoliation of the 
dead after a victory. The day after a battle dawns upon naked 
corpses. 

Who does this? Who thus sullies the triumph? Whose is this 
hideous furtive hand which glides into the pocket of victory ? Who ' 
are these pickpockets following their trade in the wake of glory? 
Some philosophers, Voltaire among others, affirm that they are 
precisely those who have achieved the glory. They are the same, 
say they, there is no exchange ; those who survive pillage those who 
succumb. The hero of the day is the vampire of the night. A man 
has a right, after all, to despoil in part a corpse which he has made. 

For our part we do not believe this. To gather laurels and to steal 
the shoes from a dead man, seems to us impossible to the same 
hand. 

One thing is certain, that, after the conquerors, come the robbers. 
But let us place the soldier, especially the soldier of to-day, beyond 
this charge. 

Every army has a train, and there the accusation should lie. Bats, 
half brigand and half valet, all species of night bird engendered 
by this twilight which is called war, bearers of uniforms who never 
fight, sham invalids, formidable cripples, interloping sutlers, trav- 
elling, sometimc.s with their wives, on little carts and stealing what 
they sell, beggars offering themselves as guides to officers, army- 
servants, marauders; armies on the march formerly— we do not 
speak of the present time— were followed by all these, to such an 
extent that, in technical language, they are called "camp-followers.” 
No army and no nation was responsible for these beings ; they spoke 
Italian and followed the Germans ; they spoke French and followed 
the Engli.sh. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish camp- 
follower who spoke French, that the Marquis of Fcrvacques, de- 
ceived by his Ftcardy gibberish, and taking him for one of us, was 
treacherously killed and robbed on the vep^' battle-field during the 
night which followed the victory of Cerisoles, From marauding 
came the marauder. The detestable maxim. Live on your enemy, 
produced this leper, which rigid discipline alone can cure. niew. 
are reputations whidh are illusory ; it is not always known why cer- 
tain generals, though th^ have b^ great, have been so popular. 
Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage; 
the permission to do wrong forms part of kindness ; Turenne was 



300 L E S M I S E R A B h K S 

SO kind that he allowed the Palatinate to be burned an&lt;I put to the 
sword. There were seen in the wake of armies more or less of 
marauders according as the coniiiiander was tnore or less severe, 
Hoche and Marceau had no camp-followers: Weningt&lt;,in — we. 
gladly do him this justice— had few. 

However, during the night of the l&lt;St!i of June, the &lt;iead were 
despoiled. Wellington was rigid; he ordered whoever should be 
taken in the act to be put to death; but rapine is jit rsrvering. The 
marauders were robbing in one corner of the liattle-lidd while they 
were shooting them in anothex*. 

The moon was an evil genius on this plain. 

Towards midnight a man was prowling or rather crawling along 
the sunken road of Chain, lie was. io all appearance* i&gt;ne of those 
whom we have just described, neither Knglisli nor iM’emin peasatU: 
nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul, attnietevl by the scent of the 
corpses, counting theft for victory, coming to riiU* VValerltH). He 
was dressed in a blouse which was in part a capote, was restless and 
daring, looking behind and before as he wtuU. Who was this man? 
Night, probably, knew more of his doings than dav ! l ie had no 
knapsack, but evideuly largt* iJocki'ts tunJer his enptUe. b'roni time 
to time he stopped, examined the jdain arotmd him as if tt» see if he 
were observed, stooped down staklenly, stirred on the grimntl some- 
thing silent and motionless, then rose up and skulked away. His 
gliding movement, his attitudes, his rapid and mysterimts gestures, 
made him seem like those twilight spectres which liaum ruins and 
■which the old Norman legends call the Goers. 

Certain nocturnal water-birds make such motions in marshes. 

An eye which had carefully penetrateii all tliis h:m% iniglit have 
noticed at some distmice, standing as it were ccmcealed behind the 
ruin whidi is on the Nivdle road at thi* ct*nier of iIh* rmite from 
Mont Saint Jean to Braine rAlknid, a sort; of little sutU*r's wag- 
gon, covered with tarred osiers, harnessed to a faniished jade 
browsing nettles through her Int, atul in the waggiMt a sort ui wom- 
an seated on some trunks and packages. IVrhaps there was same 
connection between this WMggtm and tlie prowler.

Such is the indifference of lieavem In the mead«m*s. brandies of

the departure of souls. 

The tread of the patrols and groundsmen of the English camp 
could be heard dimly in the distance.

was attadied, like a nedc^ce of rubies with two carbundes at its 
extremities, the cordon of bivouac fires of the English, extending 
in an immense semicircle over the hills of the horizon. 

We have spoken of the catastrophe of the road to Ohain. The 
heart almost sinks with terror at tlie thought of such a death for 
so many brave men. 

If anything js frightful, if tliere be a reality which surpasses 
dreams, it is this : to live, to see the sun, to be in full possession of 
manly vigour, to have health and joy, to laugh sturdily, to rush 
towards a |lory which dazzlingly invites you on, to feel a very pleas- 
ure in respiration, to feel your heart beat, to feel yourself a I'eason- 
ing being, to speak, to think, to hope, to love ; to have mother, to 
have wife, to have diildren, to have sunlight, and suddenly, in a 
moment, in less than a minute, to feel yourself buried in an abyss, 
to fall, to i-oll, to crush, to be crushed, to see the grain, the flowers, 
the leaves, the branches, to be able to seize upon nothing, to feel your 
sword useless, men under you, horses over you, to strike about you 
in vain, your bones broken by some kick in the darkness, to feel 
a heel whidi makes your eyes leap from their sockets, to grind the- 
horseshoes with rage in your teeth, to stifle, to howl, to twist, to be 
under all this, and to say : just now I was a living man 1 

There, where this ten'il)le death-rattle had been, all was now 
silent. The cut of the sunken road was filled with horses and riders 
inextricably heaped together. Terrible entanglement. There were 
no longer slopes to the road ; dead bodies filled it even with the plain, 
and came to the edge of the banks like a well-measured bushel of 
barley. A mass of dead above, a river of blood below — such was this 
road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even 
to the Nivelles road, and oozed through in a large pool in front of 
the abattis of trees, which barred that road, at a spot which is still 
shown. It was, it will be remembered, at the opposite point 
towards the road from Genappe, that the burying of the cuirassiers 
took placeu The thickness of the mass of bodies was proportioned to 
the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at a spot where 
it became shallower, over which Delord’s division had passed, this 
bed of death became thinner. 

Tlie night prowler which we have just introduced to the reader 
went in this direction. He ferreted through this immense grave. 
He looked about. He passed an indescribably hideous review of the 
dead. He walked with his feet in blood. 

Suddenly he stopped. 

A few steps before him, in the sunken road, at a point w^ere the 
mound of corpses ended, from under this mass of men and horses 
appeared an open hand, lighted by the moc«B. 

This hand had something upon a finger which 
!« gold ring. ; ■ 



302 Lj E S MIS E R A B L E S 

The man stooped down, remained a moment, and when he rose 
again there was no ring upon that hand. 

He did not rise up precisely; he remained in a sinister and 
startled altitude, turning his back to the j&gt;ile of dead, scrutinising 
the horizon, on his knees, all the front (»f his f)(&gt;dy lK*ing su|&gt; 
ported on his two fore-fingers. Jiis head raised just enough to peep 
above the edge of the hollow road. The four fjaws of the jackal arc 
adapted to certain actions. 

Then, deciding upon his course, he arose. 

At this moment he experienced a sliock. He fdt that lie was held 
a’om behind. 

He turned; it was the open hamt, wliiclt had dosed, seizing the 
tappel of his capote. 

An honest man would have been frightenetl. This man began 
to laugh, 

said he, *‘it’s only the dead man. 1 like a ghost better than 
\ gendarme,” 

However, the hand relaxed and let go its hold. Stretiglh is soon 
Exhausted in the tomb. 

‘Ah ha!” returned the prowler, “is this dead man alivt*? Let 
Its see.” 

He bent over again, rummaged anamg the he;ij), remi»ved what- 
ever impeded him, seized the hantl. laid hohl ot the arm, tlisen- 
gaged the head, drew out the body, anti some monumts after drag- 
ged into the shadow of the ht&gt;Ilow road an inanimate* ma % at least

such a way as to prevent lus being crushe&lt;l. IK eves were closeth 

He had on his cuira.ss the silver cross ot tlie 1 .egam of f Ioikhit* 

The prowler tore off this cross* which iliHaj&gt;jicared in tme of the 
gulfs which he had under his capote. 

After which he felt the officer^s foli. found a watcfi there, and

he pocketed. 

When he had reached this phase of tlie succour he was lending 
the dying man, the officer omnml \m eves. 

‘Thanks,” said he feebly. 

The rough movements of the man handling him, the cwlness of 
the mght, and breathing the fresh air freely, hail roused him from 
his lethargy. 

The prowler answered not. He raised his head. The sound of a 



C O S E T T E 303 

footstep could be heard on the plain ; probably it was some patrol 
who was approaching. 

The officer murmured, for there were still signs of suffering in 
bis Voice : 

“Who has gained the battle ?” 

“The English,” answered the prowler. 

The officer replied : 

“Search my pockets. You will there find a purse and a watch. 
Take them." 

This had already been done. 

The prowler made a pretence of executing the command, and 
sa.id : 

“There is nothing there.” 

“I have been robbed,” replied the officer; “I am sorry. They 
would have been yours.” 

The step of the patrol became more and more distinct. 

“Somebody is coming,” said the prowler, making a moven.enf 
as if he would go. 

The officer, raising himself up painfully upon one arm, held 
him back. 

“You have saved my life. Who are you ?” 

The prowler answered quick and low : 

“I belong, like yourself, to the French army. I must go. If I ati^ 
taken I shall be shot. I have saved your life. Help yourself now.” 

“What is your grade?" 

“Sergeant.” 

“What is your name ?” 

“Thenardier.” 

“I shall not forget that name,” said the officer. "And you, remem- 
ber mine. My name i.s Pontmercy.”

This wretch, who is endowed with herculean strength, managed to 
escape, but, three or four days afterwards, the police retook him, 
in Paris, just as he was getting into one of the small vehicles that 
ply between the capital and the village of Montfenneil (Seine-et' 
Oise) . It is said that he had availed himself of the interval of these 
three or four days of freedom, to withdraw a considerable sum de- 
posited by him with one of our principal bankers. The amount is 
estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. According to 
the minutes of the case, he has concealed it in some place known to 
himself alone, and it has been impossible to seize it ; however that 
may be, the said Jean Valjean has been brought before the assizes 
of tlie Department of the Var under indictment for an assault and 
robbery on the high road committed vi et armis some eight years 
ago on the person of one of those honest lads who, as the patriarch 
of Femey has written in immortal verse, 

. . . Dc Savoie arrivent totts Ics ans, 

F.t tlont la main lugerement cssiiie

This bandit attempted no defence. It was proven by the able and 
eloquent representative of the crown that the robbery was shared 
in by others, and that Jean Valjean 'formed one of a band of rob- 
bers in the South. Consequently, Jean Valjean, being found guilty, 
was condemned to death. The criminal refused to appeal to the 
higher courts, and the king, in his ine.xhaustible clemency, deigned 
to commute his sentence to that of hard labour in prison for life. 
Jean Valjean was immediately forwarded to the galleys at Toulon.” 

It will not be forgotten that Jean Valjean had at M sur 

M cerhiin religious habits. Some of the newspapers and, among 

them, the Constituiionnel, held up this commutation as a triumph 
of the cleiical party. 

Jean Valjean changed his number at the galleys. He became 
9430. 

While we are about it, let us remark, in dismissing the subject, 
that with M, Madeleine, the prosperity of M sur M — — dis- 
appeared ; all that he had foreseen, in that .light of fever and irreso- 
lution, was realised ; he gone, the soul was gone. After his down- 
fall, there was a't M sur M that egotistic distribution of 

what is left when §reat men have fallen — that fatal carving up of

There exists, in the iieighhoittiioiH! i*i Muntfentudl* a vt^ry 
ancient superstition, all the more rare and tl-ie fact 

that a popular superstition in llu* viciniiv lo I'.ois is hke an abe

circumstance that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immensw 
horns upon his head. That certainly ought to render him recognis- 
able. This man is constantly occupied in digging holes. There ar^ 
three ways of dealing when you meet him. 

The first mode is to approach the man and speak to him. Then 
you perceive that the man is nothing but a peasant, that he looks 
black because it is twilight, that he is digging no hole whatever, but 
is merely cutting grass for his cows ; and that what had been taken 
for horns are nothing but his pitchfork which he carries on his 
back, and the prongs of which, thanks to the night perspective, 
seemed to rise from his head. You go home and die within a week. 
The second method is to watch him, to wait until he has dug the 
hole, closed it up, and gone away ; then, to run quickly to the spot, 
to open it and get the “treasure” which the black-looking man has, 
of course, buried there. In this case, you die within a month. The 
third manner is not to speak to the dark man nor even to look at 
him, and to run away as fast as you can. You die within the year. 

As all three of these methods have their drawbacks, the second, 
which, at least, offers some advantages, among others that of pos- 
sessing a treasure, though it be but for a month, is the one generally 
adopted. Daring fellows, who never neglect a good chance, have, 
therefore, many times, it is asseverated, reopened the holes thus 
dug by the blaclc-looking man, and tried to rob the Devil. It would 
appear, however, that it is not a very good business — at least, if 
we are to believe tradition, and, more especially, two enigmatic lines 
in barbarous Latin left us, on this subject, by a roguish Norman 
monk, named Tryphon, who dabbled in the black art. This Tryphon 
was buried in the abbey of St. Georges de Bochervile, near Rouen, 
and toads are produced from his grave. 

Well then, the treasure-seeker makes tremendous efforts, for the 
holes referred to are dug, generally, very deep; he sweats, he digs, 
he works away all night, for this is done in the night-time ; he gets 
his clothes wet, he consumes his candle, he hacks and breaks his 
picka.xe, and when, at length, he has reached the bottom of the hole, 
when he has put his hand upon the “treasure,” what does he find? 
What is this treasure of the Evil One? A penny — sometimes a 
crown ; a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding corp.se, sometimes a spectre 
twice folded like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. 
This is what seems to be held forth to the indiscreet and prying by 
the lines of Tryphon: 

Fodit, ct in fossa thesauros condit opaca, 

As, nummos, lapidcs, cadaver, simulacra, niHlque. 

; It appears that, in our time, they find in addition sometimes a 
fflowder-hom with bullets, sometimes an old pack of brown and 
ireasy cards which have evidently been used by the DevSl. Tryphon

Now, very shortly after the time when liie authorities took it into 
thett heads that the lihet.tted convii't Jt*an \ ai|caii had, dttrin**’ Ins 
peape of a few days’ duration, been prowling aimut .Montfermei! 
it was remarked, in tiuit village, that a certain ..Id roa.i-lahourer

neighbourhood claimed to know that l.ouiasrtieile ha.i been in the

work anywliere, the goveniment enij.ltiye.l him at lialf w.ages as a

bank-bills, and that Boulatruelle had half spied out the secret The 
worst puzzled of all were the schoolmaster and the taven-keeper, 
Thenardier, who was everybody's friend, and who had not dis- 
dained to strike up an intimacy ' with even Boulatruelle. 

"'He has been in the galleys," said Thenardier. ‘‘Good Lordf 
nobody knows who is there or who may be there !" 

One evening, the schoolmaster remarked that, in old times, the 
authorities would have inquired into what Boulatruelle was about 
in the woods, and that he would have been compelled to speak — 

• even put to torture, if need were — ^and that Boulatruelle would 
not have held out, had he been put to the question by water, for 
example. 

“Let us put him to the wine question," said Thenardier. 

So they made up a party and plied the old roadsman with drinks 
Boulatruelle drank enormously, but said little. He combined with 
admirable ait and in masterly proportions the thirst of a guzzler 
with the discretion of a judge. However, by dint of returning to the 
charge and by putting together and twisting the obscure expres- 
sions that he did let fall, Thenardier and the schoolmaster made 
out, as they thought, the following: 

One morning about daybreak as he was going to his work, Boula- 
truelle had been surprised at seeing under a bush in a corner of the 
wood, a pickaxe and spade, as one would say, , hidden there. How- 
ever, he supposed that they were the pick and spade of old Six- 
Fours, the water-carrier, and thought no more about it. But, on the 
evening of the same day, he had seen, without being seen himself, 
for he was hidden behind a large tree, “a person who did not be- 
long at all to that region, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew very 
well” — or, as Thenardier translated it, ‘‘an old comrade at the 
galleys ^’ — turn off from the high road towards the thickest part of 
the wood. Boulatruelle obstinately refused to tell the stranger's 
name. This person -carried a package, something square, like a large 
box or a small trunk, Boulatruelle was surprised. Seven or eight 
minutes, however, elapsed before it occurred to him to follow the 
“person." But he was too late. The person was already in the thick 
woods, night had come on, and Boulatruelle did not succeed in oyer- 
' taking him. Thereupon he made up his mind to watch the outskirts, 
of the wood. “There was a moon," Two or three hours later, Boida- 
truelle saw this person come forth again from the wood, this time 
carrying now not the little trunk but a pick and a spade. Boula-" 
truelle let the person pass unmolested, because, as he thought bcr 
vhimself, the other was three times as strong as he, was armed with 
i a pickaxe, and would probably murder him, on reoognismg ^ 
[countenance and seeing that he, in turn, was recc^[»sed^ Toiroai^ 
ijisplay of feeling in two old compankms unexpectedly meetingli 
the pick and the spade were a ray of Eghl to Boulatruelle; he 



310 LES M I S K A 11 L K S 

hastened to the bushes, in the morning, and fnmul neither one nor 
the other. He thence concluded that tliis jierron, on entering the 
wood, had dug a hole with his ])ick, had hurietl the chest, and had, 
then, filled up the hole with hi.s spade. Now. as the chest was too 
small to contain a corpse, it must contain money ; hence his con- 
tinued searches. Boulatruelle had exjdored. sounded, and ransacked 
the whole forest, and had rummaged every .spot wliere the earth 
seemed to have been freshly disturbeii. iUn ;tli in vain. 

He had turned up nothing. Noboily tlionglit any more about it, 
at Montfermeil, excepting a few good gtyssiiis, who s.aid : "lie sure 
jthe road-labourer of Gagny didn’t make all that fuss for nothing: 
jlie devil was certainly there.”

Towards the end of October, in tliat .s;une year, 1X2.^ the inhabi- 
tants of d’oulon saw coming Iiack into tlieir port, in consequence 
of heavy woallier, and in order to repair some li.ini.iges, the ship 
Orion, which was at a later period employeii ;tt llrest ;is ;i vessel of 
instruction, and which then formed a part of the Nledilerranean 
squadron. This ship, crippled a.s .she was. for the se.a had used Iter 
roughly, produced some .scn.s;»tion on entering the ro;itlste;id. Xhe 
flew I forget what pennant, but it entitled her to a regular salute of 
eleven guns, which she returned shot for shut : in all twentv-two. 
It has been estimated that in salutes, royal and military compli- 
ments, exchange.s of courteous hnlihuh, signal.s of etiquette, road- 
stead and citadel formalities, risings ami settings of the sun .saluted 
daily by all fortre.sses and all ves.sels of war. the opening and clos- 
ing of gates, etc., etc., the civilised world, in everv j«HT of the globe, 
fires off, daily, one hundred and fifty thonsaiul tiseless cannon shots. 
'At six francs jwr shot, that would amount tti nine hundred thou- 
sand francs per day, or three huiulred millions per year, {down off 
in smoke. This is only an item. In the incunwiule, the rioor are tlving 
with hunger. ' 

The year 1823 was what the Restoration ha.s callmi the "time of 
the Spanish War.”_ 

That war comprised many events in one, and no small mmdter of 
angular tiling^. It was a great family affair of the tiourl&gt;on.s; tlie 
French branch aiding and jirotecting the brancli at Mutlrki, that is 
to say, performing the duties of seniority ; an apfiarent return to 
our national traditions, mixed up with subserviency, ami cringing

literal journals the hero of Andujar, repressing, with a triumphal 
attitude — rather contradicted by his peaceful mien — the old and 
very real terrorism of the Holy Office, in conflict with the chimeri- 
cal terrorism of the Liberals ; sans-culottes revived, to the great 
alarm of all the old dowagers, under the name of descaniisados ; 
monarchists striving to impede progress, which they styled anarchy ; 
the theories of '89 rudely interrupted in their undermining ad- 
vances; a halt from all Europe, intimated to the French idea of 
revolution, making its tour of the globe; side by side with the son 
of France, general-in-chief, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards 
Charles Albert, enlisting in this crusade of the kings against the 
peoples, as a volunteer, with a grenadier's epaulets of red wool ; the 
$oldiers of the empire again betaking themselves to the field, but 
after eight years of rest, grown old, gloomy, and under the white 
cockade ; the tricolour displayed abroad by a heroic handful of 
Frenchmen, as the white flag had been at Coblentz, thirty years 
before; monks mingling with our troopers; the spirit of liberty 
and of innovation i*educed by bayonets ; principles struck dumb by 
cannon-shot; France undoing by her arms what she had done with 
her mind ; to cap the climax, the leaders on the other side sold, their 
troops irresolute ; cities besieged by millions of money ; no military 
dangers, and yet some explosions possible, as is the case in every 
mine entered and taken by surprise ; but little blood shed, but little 
honour gained ; shame for a few, glory for none. Such was this war, 
brought about by princes who descended from Louis XIV., and 
carried on by generals who spi'ang from Napoleon. It had this 
wretched fate, that it recalled neither the image of a great war nor 
of a great policy. 

A few feats of arms were serious affairs ; the taking of Tro- 
cadero, among others, was a handsome military exploit ; but, taken 
all in all, we repeat, the trumpets of this war emit a cracked and 
feeble sound, the general appearance of it was suspicious, and his- 
tory approves the unwillingness of France to father so false a 
, triumph. It seemed clear that certain Spanish officers intrusted with 
the duty of resistance, yielded too easily, the idea of bribery was 
suggested by a contemplation of the victory; it appeared as if the 
generals rather than the battles had been won, and the victorious 
soldier returned humiliatecL It was war grown petty indeed, where 
you could read Bank of France on the folds of the flag. 

Soldiers of the war of 1808, under whose feet Saragossa had so 
terribly crumbled, knit their brows at this ready surrender of fast- 
‘ ness and citadels, and regretted Palafox. It is the mood of France 
to prefer to have before her a Rostopchine rather than a Ballesteros. 

in a still graver point of view, which it is well to urge, too, this 
war, which broke the military spirit of France, fired the democratic 
|.$pirit with indignanon. It was a scheme of subjugation. In this cam- 



312 LESMIStRABLES 

paign, the object held out to the French soldier, son of democracy, 
was the conquest of a yoke for tlie neck of another. Hideous con- 
tradiction. France exists to arouse the soul of the peoples, not to 
stifle it. Since 1792, all the revolutions of Europe have been hut the 
French Revolution: liberty radiates on every side from France. 
That is a fact as clear as noonday. Blind is he \vh&lt;.) does not see it I 
Bonaparte has said it. 

The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spatiish nation, 
was, at the same time, an outrage on the h’rench Revolution. This 
monstrous deed of violence France committed, hut Ity compulsion; 
for, aside from wars of liberation, all that armies do they do by 
compulsion. The words passive obedience tell the tale. An army is 
a wondrous masterpiece of combination, in which niight is the 
result of an enormous sum-total of utter weakness. 'I'lnis only can 
we explain a war waged by humanity against humanity, in despite 
of humanity. 

As to the Bourbons, the war of 1 823 was fatal to them. 'Phey took 
it for a success. They did not see what &lt;langer tliere is in attempt- 
ing to kill an idea by .a military watchword. 1 u tludr simplicity, they 
blundered to the extent of introducing into tiu'ir establi.shniW, as 
an element of strength, the immense enfeebUnnent of a crime. The 
spirit of ambuscade and lying in wait entere&lt;l into their policy. The 
germ of 1830 was in 1823. '1 he Spani.sli campaign became in their 
councils an argument on behalf of violent measur(!.s and intrigues 
in favour of divine right. France having restorei! el rey ncto in 
Spain, could certainly restore the absolute monardiy at lioine. They 
fell into the tremendous err&lt;.)r of mi.staking the obedience of the 
soldier for the acquiescence of the nation. That font! delusion ruins 
thrones. It will not do to fall asleef} either in the sltade of a upas 
tree or in the shatlow of an army. 

But let us return to the ship Orion. 

During the operations of the army of the Prince, cominanding- 
in-chief, a s(|uadron cruised in tin; 'Mediterranean. We htive said 
that the Orion belonged to that .stiuatlron, .and th.nt she had been 
driven back by stre.ss of weather to the port f*f Toulon, 

The presence of a vc.ssel of war in jtort ha.s .ahrnit it ti certain 
influence which attracts and engages the miiitilude. ft is because 
it i.s something grand, and the imiltitmle like what is inifwt.sing. 

A ship-of-the-line is one of the most magnificent .stnjgglc.s of 
human genius with tlic forces of natiire. 

A vessel of the line is comjjoscd of the heavie.st, and at the s.iine 
time the lightest materials, liecause she has to eonteinl, .it one and 
the same time, with the three fomts of matter, the solid, the litjuid, 
and the fluid. She has eleven claws of iron to grasp the rock at the 
bottom of the sea, and more wings and feelers than the butterfly to 
catch the breezes in the clouds. Her l&gt;reath goes forth through her 



C O S E T T E

hundred and twenty guns as through enormous trumpets, and 
haughtily answers the thunderbolt. Ocean strives to lead her astray 
in the frightful sameness of his billows, but tlie ship has her com- 
pass, which IS her soul, always counselling her and always pointing 
towards the north. In dark nights, her lanterns take the place of 
the stars. Thus, then, to oppose the wind, she has her ropes and 
canvas; against the water her timber; against the rock her iron 
her copper, and her lead; against the darkness, light; against im^ 
mcnsity, iicgcIIg, 

Whoever would form an idea of all these gigantic proportions, 
the aggregate of whicli constitutes a ship-of-the-line, has but to 
pass under one of the covered ship-houses, six stories high, at Brest 
or Toulon. The vessels m process of construction are seen there 
under glass cases, so to speak. That colossal beam is a yard: that 
huge column of timber lying on the ground and reaching out of 
sight is the mainmast. Taking it from its root in the hold to its sum- 

Ti’ fathoms long, and is three feet in diame- 

ter at Its base. The English mainmast nses'two hundred and seven- 
teen feet above the water-line. The navy of our fathers used cables 
ours uses chains Now the mere coil of chains of a hundred-gun 
ship IS four feet high, twenty feet broad, and eight feet thick. And 
for the construction of this vessel, how much timber is required^ 
It IS a floating forest. h * ■ 

And yet, be it remembered, that we are here speaking only of the 
war yessel of some forty years ago, the mere sailing craft; steam, 
then m its infancy, has, since that time, added new wonders to this 
prodigy called a man-of-war. At the present day, for example, the 
mixed vessel, the screw-propeller, is a surprising piece of niechan- 
ism moved by a spread of canvas measuring four thousand square 
yards of surface, and by a steam-engine of twenty-five hundred 
horse power, ^ 

Without referring to these fresher marvels, the old-fashioned 
ship of Christopher Columbus and of De Ruyter is one of the 
noblest works of, man. It is exhaustless in force as the breadth of 
infinitude; it gathers up the wind in its canvas, it is firmly fixed in 
the immense chaos of the waves, it floats and it reigns. 

. But a moment comes, when the white squall breaks that sixty- 
foot yard like a straw ; and when the wind flaw bends that four hun- 
,dred foot mast like a reed; when that anchor, weighing its tons 
|ipon tons, IS twisted m Ihe maw of the wave like the angle’s hook 
^ the jaws of a pike ; when those monster guns utter plaintive tod 
futile roarings which the tempest whirls away into space and night, 
^hen all this might and all this majesty are engulfed in a superic«r 
pight and majesty. ' .

In the latitude of the Balearic Isles, her planking had li&gt;nsvned

One morning, the throng wliich was ga/ing at her wuues.ed an 
accident. 

The cre\v was engaged in furlitig sail. The tepmart. wToMrdutyit

his balance. He was seen tonering ; tfu* deuNe tlirun;: assendded on

w*ith oiH* hand, and then wah i!ie t »t!irr, an?l fanig sm pended in tluil

the poor fellow hung dangling loand fro at tl;e end oHhrs line, ^’ke

branch of a tree, is life itself, (^and it is a frightful thing to see a liv- 
ing being lose his hold upon it, and fall like a ripe fruit. 

Suddenly, a man was discovered clambering up the rigging with 
the agility of a wildcat. This man was clad in red — it was a convict.; 
he wore a green cap — it was a convict for life. As he reached the 
round top, a gust of wind blew off his cap and revealed a head en- 
tirely white : it was not a young man. 

In fact, one of the convicts employed on board in some prison 
task, had, at the first alarm, run to the officer of the watch, and, amid 
ffie confusion and hesitation of the crew, while all the sailors trem- 
bled and shrank back, had asked permission to save the topman's 
life at the risk of his own. A sign of assent being given, with one 
blow of a hammer he broke the chain riveted to the iron ring at his 
ankle, then took a rope in his hand, and flung himself into the 
shrouds. Nobody, at the moment, noticed with what ease the chain 
was broken. It was only some time afterwards that anybody re- 
membered it. 

In a twinkling he was upon the yard. He paused a few seconds, 
and seemed to measure it with his glance. Those seconds, during 
which the wind swayed the sailor to and fro at the end of the rope, 
seemed ages to the lookers-on. At length, the convict raised his eyes 
to heaven, and took a step forward. The crowd drew a long breath. 
He was seen to run along the yard. On reaching its extreme tip, he 
fastened one end of the rope he had with him, and let the other hang 
at full length. Thereupon, he began to let himself down by his hands 
along this rope, and then there was an inexpressible sensation of 
terror ; instead of one man, two were seen dangling at that giddy 
height. 

You would have said it was a spider seizing a fly; only, in this 
case, tile spider was bringing life, and not death. Ten thousand eyes 
)vere fixed upon the group. Not a cry ; not a word was uttered ; the 
same emotion contracted every brow. Every man held his breath, as 
if afraid to add the least whisper to the wind which was swaying the 
two unfortunate men. 

, However, the convict had, at length, managed to make his way 
down to the seaman. It was time ; one minute more, and the man, 
.exhausted and despairing, would have fallen into the deep. The con- 
fict firmly secured him to the rope to which he clung with one hand 
while he worked with the other. Finally, he was seen reascending 
the yard, and hauling the sailor after him; he supported him 
Aere, for an instant, to let him recover his strength, ahd then, lift- 
^ him in his arms, carried him, as he walked along the yarf,‘to the 
^osstrees, and from there to the round-top, where he left him in the 
fends of 'his mess-mates. ■ 

K^Then the throng applauded ; old galley sergeants wept, women 
^feged each other on' the whkrves, and, on all sides, voices were

heard exclaiming, &gt;vith a sort^of tciulcrly stilniucil enthusiasni:— 
'‘This luan must be pardoned r’ ^ ^ 

He, however, had made it a point t»f dnl&gt;^ ti» desceiul again ini- 
mediately, and go back to his work* In tjolcr to an ne iiane quukly, 
he slid down the rigging* and started to run ahmg a lower yard. All 
eyes were following hirn. There was a certain moment wiien every 
one felt alarmed ; whether it was that he tell tatirtued. because 
his head swam, people llanighl they saw him hesitate aiu! stager. 
Suddenly, the throng uttered a thriiling outcry: tlic Ciuivict had 

fallen into the sea. , i ^ 

The fall was perilous. The frigate Jhjamis was ntoorisl dose to 
the OrioUf and the poor convict hatl plnngeii hetu turn tin* Uve^ s!nps.

FULFILMENT OF THE PROMISE TO THE DEPARTED 

I 

THE WATER QURSTION AT MONTFERMEIL 

Montfermeil is situated between I-ivry and Chelles, upon the 
southern slope of the high plateau which separates the Ourcq fi'om 
the Marne. At present, it i.s a considerable town, adorned all the year 
round with stxiccoed villas, and, on Sundays, with citizens in full 
blossom. In 1823, there were at Montfermeil neither so many white 
houses nor so many comfortable citizens ; it was nothing but a vil- 
lage in the woods. You would find, indeed, here and there a few 
country .seats of the last century, recognisable by their grand ap- 
pearance, their balconies of twisted iron, and those long windows 
the little panes of which .show all sorts of different greens upon the 
white of the closed shutters. But Montfermeil was none the less a vil- 
lage. Retired dry-goods merchants and amateur villagers had not yet 
discovered it. It was a peaceful and charming sixit, and not upon the 
road to any place ; the inhabitants cheaply enjoyed that rural life 
which is so luxuriant and so easy of enjoyment. But water was 
scarce there on account of the height of the plateau. 

Thqy had to go a considerable distance for it. The end of the vil- 
lage towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds in 
the forest on that side ; the other end, which surrounds the church 
and which is towards Chclks, found drinking-water only at a little 
spring on the side of the hill, near the road to Chelles, about fifteen 
minutes’ walk from Montfermeil 
It was therefore a serious matter for each household to obtain its 
supply of water. The great houses, the aristocracy, the Thinardier 
tavern included, paid a penny a budket-fuH to an old man who made 
it his business, and whose income from the Montfermeil water- 
works was about eight sous per day ; but this man worked mily tiB 
seven o’clock in summer and five in the winter, and when ni^ had 
cbrae on, ^nd the first-floor shutters were dosed, whoewsr had nd 
drinking-water went after it, or went without it 
This was the terror of the poor being whom the reiser haa 
not perhaps foigotten— little Cosette. It irill be jomembeaKsd that 
Cosette was useful to the ThfeardKers to two ways, they got |»y 
from the mother and worie from the child. Thus when the mo®e«

the Tlicnardiers kept Cosette. She saved them a st/rvant. in that 
capacity she ran for water when it was wanted. S*) tlie ehild. always 
horrilied at the idea of goiii.t*' to tlu‘ at uiidu -und caJ’e

Christmas in the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfer- 
meik The early part of the winter had lu'en mild ; fan- tlu‘re liad 
been neither frost nor snow. Some jte^j.;lers ivmn I'aris had oV 
tamed permission from the mayor to set up tlieii- .stalls in tho main 
street of the village, and a company t»f pedlars h:v\, uiider the sanui 
licence, put up their booths in the stpiare t unraa* tin* i lmn h atnl even 
in the lane du Boulanger, u|&gt;on which, as the readfu' |wr!iaps reineni- 
bers, the Thenardier chaph(*u.se was situated. I’his UlWA up the tav- 
erns and potdiouscs, ainl gave tt&gt; this litth* tptiet place a ttt»isv and 
joyous appearance. We ought also \n say, tn he a ta.itlu ul historian 
that, among the curiosities ilisplayctl in the sqtuu e, thet e was a men- 
agerie in which frightful clowns, clad iti rags and cume imhodv

nieil one of those horrid Braktilian vtiUmc'**. a s|M-citucn t»i which our 
Museum Royal did not tddaiu until IS 15, and the vw ut which is a 
tri-coloured cockade. Naturalists call this Idni, t helicM*. i aracarii 
Polyhorus ; it belongs ta the i»rder of tlie A|/i. idar and fltr family of

Etc. 

Or, indeed, a miller might be bawling : — 

'"Are we responsible for what there is in the bags ? We find a heap 
of little seeds there, but we can't amuse ourselves by picking out, 
and of course we have got to let 'em go through the stones ; there's 
darnel, there's fennel, there's cockles, there's vetch, there's hemp, 
there's fox-tail, and a lot of other weeds, not counting the stones 
that there is in some wheat, especially Breton wheat. I don't like to 
grind Breton wheat, no more than carpenters like to saw boards 
with nails in 'em. Just think of the dirt that all that makes in the till. 
And then they complain of the flour. It's their own fault. We ain't 
to blame for the flour." 

Between two windows, a mower seated at a table with a farmer, 
who was making a bargain for a piece of work to be done the next 
season, was saying : — • 

‘There is no harm in the grass having the dew on. It cuts better. 
The dew is a good thing. It is all the same, that are grass o' yours 
is young, and pretty hard to cut. You see it is so green; you see it 
bends under the scythe." 

Etc. 

Cosette was at her usual place, seated on the cross-piece of the 
kitchen table, near the fire-place ; she was clad in rags ; her bare feet 
were in wooden shoes, and by the light of the fire she was knitting 
wollen stockings for the little Thenardiers. A young kitten was play- 
under the chairs. In a neighbouring room the fresh voices of two 
children were heard laughing and prattling; it was Eponine and 
Azelma. 

In the chimney-corner, a cow-hide hung upon a nail. 

At intervals, the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere 
in the house, was heard above the noise of the bar-ropm. This was 
a little boy which the woman had had some winters before — '‘She 
didn't know why," she said : "it was the cold weather," — ^and which 
was a little more than three years old. The mother had nursed him, 
but did not love him. When the hungry clamour of the brat became 
(too much to hear: — "Your boy is squalling,” said Thenardier, "why 
&gt; don't you go and see what he wants ?" "Bah !" answered the mother ; 
"I am sick of him." And the poor little fellow continued to cry in the 
■ darkness* 


TWO TORTil^AITS COHTEETED 

IThe Thenardiers have hitherto been seen in this bcKSk; in profile

there was an equilibi'ium of age l)et\vecn the huslumd and \vi fe. 

The reader has perhaps, since Iier lirst a|»pcarance. iircserved 
some remembrance of this huge I'henardiess; - -for such we shall 
call the female of this species, — large, hloml, rcil, fat, brawny 
square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to tlie 
race of those colossal wild women wdio posturise :it fairs with 
paving-stones hung in their hair. She did everything .ahont the 
house, the chamber-work, the washing, the cooking, any thing she 
pleased, and played the deuce generally, foseite vv,is her only ser- 
vant; a mou.se in the service of an ele|)hant. Everything treiiililed 
at the sound of her voice ; wimlows and furniture as well as people. 
Her bi'oad face, covered with freckles, hatl the appearnttce of a 
.skimmer. She had a heard. She was the iiieal of a btitclicr's boy 
dressed in petticoats. She swore splendidly; sin; prided herself on 
being able to crack a nut with her list. .’Vjiart from the novels she 
had read, which at tiine.s pve you an odd glimpse of the affecUui 
lady under the ogress, the idea tJf calling her ;i wojn;m never would 
have occurred to anybody. This Tlieiiardiess seemed like a cross 
between a wench and a lishwomati. If vott heunl her sjieak, vtiu 
would say it is a gendanne ; if you saw her drink. \ &lt;ui would sa'v it 
is a cartinan ; if you saw her Iiandle Coselte. you would sav it is tile 
hangman. When at rest, a tootli pntlnidetl from iter moutli. 

The other Thenardier was a little man. meagre, p.-de. tnigular 
bony, and lean, who appeared to he sick, and wlmse health was 
excellent ; here his knavery liegan. I le smiled h;d»ituaUy .as a matter

said in the village that he had studied for the prieithood. 



C O S E T T E 321 

We believe that he had only studied in Holland to be an inn- 
keeper. This whelp of the composite order was, according to all 
probability, some Fleming of Lille in Flanders, a Frenchman in 
Paris, a Belgian in Brussels, conveniently on the fence between the 
two frontiers. We understand his prowess at Waterloo. As we have 
seen, he exaggerated it a little. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure^ 
was his element ; a violated conscience is followed by a loose life ; 
and without doubt, at the stormy^ epoch of the 18th of June, 1815, 
Thenardier belonged to that species of marauding sutlers of whom 
we have spoken, scouring the country, robbing hei'e and selling 
there, and travelling in family style, man, woman, and children, in 
some rickety carr}r-all, in the wake of marching troops, with the 
instinct to attach himself always to the victorious army. This cam- 
paign over, having, as he said, some “quibus,” he had opened. a 
■‘chop-house” at Montfermeil. 

This “quibus,” composed of purses and watches, gold rings and 
silver crosses, gathered at the harvest time in the furrows sown with 
corpses, did not form a great total, and had not lasted this sutler, 
now become a tavern-keeper, very long. 

Thenardier had that indescribable stiffness of gesture which, with 
an oath, reminds you of the barracks, and, with a sign of the cross, 
of the seminary. He was a fine talker. He was fond of being thought 
learned. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster remarked that he made mis- 
takes in pronunciation. He made out travellers’ bills in a superior 
style, but practi.sed eyc.s sometimes found them faulty in orthog- 
raphy. Thenardier was sly, greedy, lounging, and clever. He did 
not disdain .servant girls, consequently his wife had no more of 
them. This giantess was jealous. It seemed to her that this little, 
lean, and yellow man must be the object of universal desire. 

Thenardier, above all a man of astuteness and poise, was a rascal 
of the subdued order. This is the worst species; there is hypocrisy 
in it. , 

Not that Thenardier was not on occasion capable of anger, quite 
as much as his wife ; but that was very rare, and at such tunes, as if 
he were at war with the whole human race, as if he had in him a 
deep furnace of hatred, as if he were of those who are perpetually 
avenging themselves, who accuse everybody about them o f me evils 
that befall them, and are always ready to throw on the first omaer, 
as legitimate grievance, the sum-total of the deceptions, failures, 
and calamities of their life~as all this leaven woriced in him, and 
toiled up into his mouth and eyes, he was frightful. Woe. to him 
who came within reach of his fury, then ! , 

Besides all his other qualities, Thfeardier was atenfive and pf^ 
etrating, silent or talkative as occasion required, and always with 
great intelligence. He had somewhat fiie lode of sailors aacemtomed

to squinting the eye in looking througli si)&gt;'-glasses, Tlienanlicr was 

a statesman. 

Every new-comer who entered the chn|&gt;-hnuse sai&lt;l, on seeing the 
Thenardiess : There is the master of the house. It was an ermr. She 
was not even the mistress. The husband was Imth master and mis- 
tress, She performed, he created, lie direetedi evervllnng iiy a sort

times a sign; the mastodon obeyed. 'Ttumardier was to inn*, without 
her being really aware of it, a sort of Ixnng apart and sovtnadgn. She 
had the virtues of lier onler of creatitm ; never wotilt! she have dif- 
fered in any detail with ‘'Monsieur Tlienarddi'r”- nor iinpiissihle 
supposition—would she have puhlicly qtiarrtdled with her Inrdtand, 
on any matter whatever. Never had she eonunittet! ‘'heftne com- 
pany*' that fault of which women are so oftmi guilt v, amt which is 
called in parliamentary language: discovering ttie crowm Ahlauigh 
their accord had no other result than evil, tliere was itUMl fnr con- 
templation in the submission o{ the Tluhiardic' s to her husl»and. 
This bustling moimtain of ilesh luovral under the little tinger of this 
frail despot. It was, viewetl from its dwarfeil ami grote.ajue side, 
this great universal fact : the homage of matter spirit ; for certain 
deformities have their origin in the deptlis even of etr'rnal lieauty. 
There was somewhat of the unknown in M’hemorhrr ; hence the ab- 
solute empire of tliis man over tins woman. At times, she looked 
upon him as upon a lighted candb* ; at iU he rs, she f edt him like a claw. 

This woman was a formblalde creathm, who loved tmihiug I^ut 
her children, and feared notlniig Inil her lnist&gt;au»k She was a uiother 
because she was a mammal Her maternal iVclitigs st.np|&gt;rd with Iter 
girls, and, as we shall see, did not extend ti» biws, The man hatl but 
one thought — to get rich. 

He did not succeed. His great talents had no adnpmte ojqmrUm- 
ity. Thenardier at Montfermei! was rtiining Idmsrlf, if ruin is pos- 
sible at /.ero, In Switzerland, or in the Evreuees, this penrnless rogue 
would have become a millionaire. Ihif wlnue fate j&gt;kues tlie inn- 
keeper he must luanvse. 

It is understood that the wrmi imtkeef^fr is rmfijoved here in a 
restricted sense, and does not extend lo an emire 

In this same year, 1823* Thenardier o\v*’d ;d»Mut fifteen fuindred 
francs, of pressing delits, which rmlcrcil him nunnh. 

However obstinately unjust destiny was to him* Unhiardief was 
one of those men who best iinderstiwHl m the grealesl depth am! 
m the most modern style, that which is a virtue among the hailiar- 
ous, and a subject of merchandise among the civilised-- liospiialilv. 
He was. besides, an admiralde |wmd»er. and was eomiied an exceV 
lent shot. He had a certain cool and quiet laughs whidi was irartica- 
larly dangerous. 

His theories of itmkeeping sometimes sprang from him by flashes, 



C O S E T T E 323 

He had certain professional aphorisms which he inculcated in the 
mind of his wife. “The duty of the innkeeper/’ said he to her one 
,day, emphatically, and in a low voice, “is to sell to the first comer, 
food, rest, light, fire, dirty linen, servants, fleas, and smiles ; to stop 
travellers, enipty small purses, and honestly lighten large ones ; to 
receive families who are travelling, with respect: scrape the man, 
pluck the woman, and pick the child; to charge for the open win- 
dow, the closed window, the chimney corner, the sofa, the chair, the 
stool, the bench, the feather bed, the mattress, and the straw bed ; to 
know how much the mirror is worn, and to tax that ; and, by the 
five hundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for every- 
thing, even to the flies that his dog eats !” 

This man and this woman were cunning and rage married — a 
hideous and terrible pair. 

While the husband calculated and schemed, the Thenardiess 
thought not of absent creditors, took no cai'e either for yesterday or 
the morrow, and lived passionately in the present moment. 

Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, under- 
going their double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time 
being bruised by a millstone, and lacerated witli pincei’s. The man 
and the woman had each a different way. Cosette was beaten un- 
mercifully ; that came from the woman. She went barefoot in win- 
ter ; that came from the man. 

Cosette ran up stairs and down stairs ; washed, brushed, scrubbed: 
swept, ran, tired herself, got out of breath, lifted heavy things, and^ 
puny as she was, did the rough work. No pity ; a ferocious mistress^ 
a malignant master. The Thenardier chop-house "was like a snare, in 
which Cosette had been caught, and was trembling. The ideal of op- 
pression was realised by this dismal servitude. It was something like 
a fly serving spiders. 

The poor child was passive and silent. 

When they find themselves in such condition at the dawn of ex- 
istence, so young, so feeble, among men, what passes in these souls 
fresh from God ! 


Ill 

MEN MtTST HAVE WINE ANP HORSES WATER 

Four new guests had just come in. 

Cosette was musing sadly ; for, though she was only eight years 
old, she had already suffered so much that she mused with the 
mournful air of an old woman. 

She had a black eye from a blow of the Theiiardiess’s fist, which 
made the Thenardiess say from time to time, “How ugly she is 
with her x&gt;atch on her eye/" 



324 L E S Ml S E K A » 1. K S 

Cosettc was then thinking that it was evening, late in the evening, 
that the bowls and pitchers in the rooms ol the travellers who had 
arrived must be filled immediately, and that there was no more, 
water in the cistern. 

One thing comforted her a little: they did not drink much water 
in the Thenardier tavern. 'I’liere were plenty of_ people there who 
were thirsty; but it was that kind of thiist which reaclte.s rather 
towards the jug th;in the pitcher. Had anvboilv askeii lor a gla,ss of 
water among these glas.se.s of wine, he would have .seemed a savage 
to all those men. However, tiiere was an instant when tlie child 
trembled; the Thenardiess niised the cover of a kettle wbieh was 
boiling on the range, then took :t glass and hastily appro, lehed the 
cistern. She turned the faucet ; the child had nti-ed her head and 
followed all her movenieitts. .-X thin .stream of w.iler r.-m trom the 
faucet, and filled the glas.s h;df fnll. 

“Here," said she, “there Is no more water !” Then .she was silent 
for a moment. The child held her hreatli. 

“P,shaw !" contimted the Theiiariliess, es.nnining the half-filled 
glass, “there is enmigli of it, such as it is." 

Cosette resumed her work, hut for more than a quarter of an 
hour she felt her heart leaping info her throat like a great bull. 

She countefl tlie minutes as they lliiis rolled .aw.iv, and etigerly 
wished it were morning. 

■ From time to time, one of the drinkers would look out into tlu* 
street and exclaim ; — “U is ns black a,s an oven !" i&gt;r. "It would take 
a cat to go along the .street without a lantern to-night !'* .\nd t'osette 
shuddered. 

All at once, one of the pcdbirs who lodgeil sti tlie t.iveni came in, 
and said in a li:ir.sh voice: 

“You have not w.atered rny horse.” 

“Yes, we have, stire," said the '1 iuhiardiess, 

“1 tell you no, tna'am,” repliet! the pedlar. 

Co.sette came out fnini uwler the talde, 

“Oh, yes, monsh'iir!" .said site, "the li.u se did drink : be drank in 
the hucket, the bucket full, niul 'tw.is me that carried it to him, .and 
1 talked to him." 

This was not true, ("oselte lied. 

“Mere is a girl as big a.s my tis(, who c.m tell a lie as big a.s a 
house," exclaimed the iKsliar. “1 tel! you that lie has not h.ad any 
water, little wench ! He has a wav of blowing when he ha.s not had 
any water, that 1 know well enough." 

Cosette persisted, and added in a voice mitled with anguish, and 
which couki hanlty he heard : 

“But he did drink a goofl deal." 

“Come,"'' continued the pedlar. In a passion, “that is enough ; give 
my horse some water, anti say no more about it" 



325 


- COSETTE 

Cosette went back under the table. 

“Well, of course that is right,” said the Thenardiess; “if the 
beast has not had any water, she must have some.” 

Then looking about her : 

“Well, what has become of that girl ?” 

She stooped down and discovered Cosette crouched at the othet 
end of the table, almost under the feet of the drinkers. 

“Am’t you coming?” cried the Thenardiess. 

Cosette came out of the kind of hole where she had hidden. Th&lt; 
Thenardiess continued : 

“Mademoiselle Dog-without-a-name, go and cariy some drink to 
this horse.” 

“But, ma’am,” said Cosette feebly, “there is no water.” 

The Thenardiess threw the street door wide open. 

“Well, go after some !” 

Cosette hung her head, and went for an empty bucket that was by 
the chimney corner. 

The bucket was larger than she, and the cliild could have sat 
down in it comfortably. 

The Thenardiess went back to her range, and taked what was ia 
the kettle with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while. 

“There is some at the spring. She is the worst girl that ever vyas, 
I think ’twould have been better if I’d left out the onions.” 

Then she fumbled in a drawer where there were some pennies, 
pepper, and garlic. 

“Here, Mamselle Toad,” added she, “get a big loaf at the baker’s, 
as you come back. Here is fifteen sous.” 

Cosette had a little pocket in the side of her apron ; she took the 
piece without saying a word, and put it in that pocket. 

Then she remained motionless, bucket in hand, the open door be- 
fore her. She seemed to be waiting for somebody to come to her aid. 

“Get along I” cried the Thenardiess. 

Cosette went out. The door closed. 


IV 

A DOLL ENTERS UPON THE SCENE 

The row of booths extended along the street from the church, the 
reader will remember, as far as the Thfeardier tavern. These 
booths, on account of the approaching passage of the dtizens w 
their way to the midnight mass, were all illuminated with candle 
burning in paper lanterns, which, as the schoolmaster of Montfer- 
meil, who was at . that moment seated at oneol. Tblinafdier*s^^ 
|said, produasd aawgkal effect. In retaliation, not a star was te be 
jseen in the dcy. 



326 LES MISERABLE S 

The last of these stalls, set up exactly opposite Thenardier’s door, 
was a toy-shop, all glittering with trinkets, glass beads, and things 
magnificent in tin. In the first rank, and in front, the merchant had 
placed, upon a bed of white napkins, a great doll nearly two feet 
high dressed in a robe of itink-crape with golderi wheat-ears on its 
head, and which had real hair and enaimd eyes. The whole, day, this 
marvel had been displayed to the hewildennent of the passers un- 
der ten years of age, but there had not l&gt;cen fouiid iii M out fenneil a 
mother rich enough, or prodigal enough to give it to her child. 
Eponine and Azelma had pa.ssed hours in conteniplatiiig it, arul Co- 
sette herself, furtively, it i.s true, had dared to look ;if it. 

At the moment when Cosette went out, bucket in band, all gloomy 
and overwhelmed as she was, .she could not help raising her eyes 
towards this wonderful doll, towards the laily, as she cidletl it. The 
poor child stopped petrified. She had not seen this &lt;ion so ne.ar Ijc- 
fore. 

This whole booth .seemed a palace to her ; this doll was tjot a doll, 
it was a vision. It was joy, sjdeiulour, riches, h.ippiness, and it ap- 
peared in a sort of chimerical radiance to this unfititimale little 1h'- 
mg, buried .so deeply in a cold and dismal misery, fosette \v;is meas- 
uring with the sad an&lt;l simple sagacity of eliildhood the abyss which 
separated her from that tloll. .She w.as saying to herself th:il one 
must be a queen, or at lea.st a jirincess, to have a "tltiiig" like that. 
S*’.e gazed uixm this beaiitifnl pink dress, this heautiftil smooth 
Hir, and .she was thinking, “llnw happy must be tliat doll!" Mer 
»7e could not turn away from this fantastic b»«t!i. The longer she 
boked, the more she was dazzled. .She thought she saw {sanulise. 
There were other dolls f&gt;ehind the large one that api&gt;eaicd to her tn 
be fairies and genii. The merchant walking to amt Iro in the hack 
part of his stall, suggested the Eternal hatiier. 

In thi.s adoration, ,slu; forgot everything, even the errand on wliidi 
she had Iteen .sent. .Suddenly, the harsh voi»e of the Thenardie.ss 
called her back to the reality: "How, jade, haven't you gone vet? 
Hold on; I am coining for you ! I'd like to km&gt;w what she's lining 
ihere ? Idttle mon.ster, ite off !" 

The. Then:udtc.ss had glauceil into the street, ami pereeivetl 
Cosette in ecstasy. 

Cosette fled with her bucket, miming jts fast as she could, 


V 

THE Urri-K (URt. Al.t. AWNE 

As the Th6iardier tavern wtis in that part of the village which is 
near the church, Cosette had to go to the spring in the woods towards 
C hclles to draw water. 



C O S E T T E 32 / 

She looked no more at the displays in the booths,, so long as she 
was in tlie lane Boulanger; and in the vicinity of the church, the 
illuminated vStalls lighted the way, but soon the last gleam from the 
last stall disap]u?arc&lt;L ddic poor child found herself in darkness. She 
became buried in it. Only, as she became the prey of a certain sen- 
sation, she shook the handle of the bucket as much as she could on 
her way. That made a noise, which kept her comjxuiy. 

The further she went, the thicker became the darkness, ddiere was 
no longer anybody in the street. However, she met a woman who 
turned around on seeing her pass, and remained motionless, mutter- 
ing between her teeth ; “Where in tlie world can that child be going' 
Is it a phantom child ?” Then the woman recognised Cosette. “Oh,’' 
said she, “it is the lark,!’’ 

Cosette thus ])assed through the labyrinth of crooked and de- 
serted streets, which terminates the village of Montfermcil towards 
Chelles. As long as sh(‘ had houses, or even walls, on the sides of the 
road, she w'ent on boldly etiougii. .From time to time, she saw the 
light of a candle tlirough the cracks of a shutter; it w^as light and 
life to her ; there were ])eople there ; that kept U|) her courage. How- 
ever, as she advanced, her vSpeed slackened as if mechanically. When 
she had passed the covwar of the last house, Cosette stopped. To go 
beyond the last booth had l)ecn difficult; to go further than the last 
house became iinj:)ossil)Ic. She put the bucket on the ground, buried 
her hands in her liair, and l)egan to scratch her head slowly, a mo- 
tion peculiar to terrified and hesitating children. It was Montfer- 
meil no longer, it was the oi)en country ; dark and deserted space 
was before her. She looked witli despair into this darkness wliere 
nobody was, where there were beasts, wh(‘rc there were perhaps 
ghosts’*. She looked intensely, and she heard the animals walking in 
the grass, and slie distinctly saw the ghosts moving in the trees. 
Then she seized licr Imcket again ; fear gave her boldness : **Pshaw,” 
said she, “ I will tell her there isn’t any more w'ater !” And she reso- 
lutely went back into Montfermcil. 

Slic had scarcely gone a hundred steps when she stopped again, 
and began to scratch her hea&lt;l. Now. it was the Thenardiess that 
appeared to her; the hideous Thenardiess, with her h_vena mouth 
an&lt;l wrath Hashing from her eyes. The child cast a pitiful glance be- 
fore her aiul behind her. Wliat could she do? What would become 
of her? Where should she go? Fefore her. the spectre of the Then- 
ardiess ; behind her, all the phantoms of night and of the forest. It 
was at the Thenardiess that she recoiled. She took the road to the 
spring again, and began to run. Site ran out of the village ; she ran 
into the woods, seeing nothing, hearing nothing. She did not stop 
running until out of breath, and even then she staggered on. She 
went right on, desperate. 

rCven wliile running, she wanted to cry. 



328 h E S MIS E K A B 1- K S 

The nocturnal tremulousness of tlic forest vv'ra|&gt;|&gt;ecl her about 
completely* 

She thought no more; she saw nothing nun'c, 'riu* iniinensity of 
night confronted this lirJo creature, t hi one side, tlie infinite 
shadow ; on the other, an al ( an. 

It was only seven or eight niiinitcs’ walk from the edge of the 
woods to the spring. Cosctle knew the road, in*in travidhug it sev- 
eral times a day. Strange thing, she did not lose her A remnant 
of instinct guided her bliiully, Ihtt she neither turnecl her eyes to the 
right nor to the left, for fear of seeing thitigs in tlie trees and in the 
bushes. Thus she arrived at the spring. 

It was a small natural basin,, made by the water in tiie Inamy soil, 
about two feet deep, surnnindetl with moss, am! with that long 
figured grass called Henry Fourth’s collars, and pa\t‘d with a few 
large stones. A brook escaped from it with a gentle, tram]uil luur- 
tnur. 

Cosette did not take time to breatlua It was very dark, but she 
was accustomed to conuvto this ftumtain. Slu* fidt with her left harul 
in the darkness for a young oak which hent over the Npriiig arul usu- 
ally served her as a support, found a luauch, su ung herself from it, 
bent down and plunged the Iniektl in tlie water. She was for a 
moment so excited that: her strength was tripled. W hen she w.as tltus 
bent over, she did not notice that the pocket of her aprem emptied 
itself into the spring. The lift&lt;‘en-sous i»iece fell iiUo the water, 
Co.sette neither saw it nor heart! if fa!!. Slu* tirew out the bucket al- 
most full and set it on the grass. 

This done, she perceived that her strength wa - 4caham4&lt;*d, She 
was anxious to start at once ; InU the elfort nf fdhng the !»ucket hatl 
been .so great that it was inipossilde for her tale a step, Slu* was 
compelled to sit tlown. She fell ii|ion f!ie grass aiul remained in a

without the power of doing otherwi.M*. At her side, the water shaken

Above her head, the sky was covered with vast black clouds 
which were like sheet.s of snkike. 1’!m tragit' mad% of nigbl seemed 
to hentl vaguely over tliis child.

The child loiiked with a slarlleel eje upon that grt*at star which 
she did not know and which made her afraul, llie idaneu in fact, 
was at that moment very near (lie fioi i/on and was crossing a dense 
bed of mist which gave it a horrid redness. 11te misl, glooinilv em-

cations of summer. Great branches drew themselves up fearfully. 
Mean and shapeless bushes whistled in the glades. The tall grass 
wriggled under the north wind like eels. The brambles twisted about 
like long arms seeking to seize their prey in their claws. Some dry, 
weeds driven by the wind, passed rapidly by, and appeared to flee 
with dismay before something that was following. The prospect was 
dismal. 

Darkness makes the brain giddy. Man needs light, whoever 
plunges into the opposite of day feels his heart chilled. When the 
eye sees blackness, the mind sees trouble. In an eclipse, in night, in 
the sooty dai’kness, there is anxiety even to the strongest. Nobody 
walks alone at night in the forest without trembling. Darkness and 
trees, two formidable depths — b. reality of chimeras appears in the 
indistinct distance. The Inconceivable outlines itself a few steps 
from you with a spectral clearness. You see floating in space or in 
your brain something strangely vague and unseizable as the dreams 
of sleeping flowers. There are fierce phantoms in the horizon. You 
breathe in the odours of the great black void. You are afraid, and 
are tempted to look behind you. The hollowness of night, the hag' 
gardness of all things, the silent profiles that fade away as you ad- 
vance, the obscure dishevelments, angry clumps, livid pools, the 
gloomy reflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of silence, 
the possible unknown beings, the swaying of mysterious branches, 
the frightful twistings of the trees, long spires of shivering grass^ 
against all this you have no defence. There is no bravery which does 
not shudder and feel the nearness of anguish. You feel something 
hideous, as if the soul were amalgamating with the shadow. This 
penetration of the darlmess is inexpressibly dismal for a child. 

Forests are apocalypses ; and the beating of the wings of a little 
soul makes an agonising sound under their monstrous vault. 

Without being conscious of what she was experiencing, Cosette 
felt that she was seized by this black enormity of nature. It was not 
merely terror that held her, but something more terrible even than 
terror. She shuddered. Words fail to express the peculiar strange- 
ness of that shudder which chilled her through and through. Her 
eye had become wild. She felt that perhaps she would be compelled 
to return there at the same hour the next night. 

Then, by a sort of instinct, to get out of this singular state, which 
she did not understand, but which terrified her, she began to count 
aloud, one, two, three, four, up to ten, and when she had finished, she 
began again. This restored her to a real perception of things about 
her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water, felt cold. 
She arose. Her fear had returned, a natural and insurmountable 
fear. She had only one thought, to fly; to fly with all her might, 
across woods, across fields, to houses, to windows, to lighted candles. 
Her eyes fell upon the bucket that was before her. Such, was the 



330 L E S M I S E R A r. T. K S 

dread with which the Thenanliessinspiml lier, that slie did iH»t dare 
to go without the bucket of water. She grasj)ed tiie handle with both 
hands. She could hardly lift the bucket. 

She went a dozen steps in this niantier, hut tlu‘ bucket was full, it 
was heavy, she was compelled to rest it on the gnmndi. She breathed 
an instant, then grasped the handle again, and walki*d this time 
a little longer. But she had to stop again. AftiT resting a few sec- 
onds, she started on. She walked bending forward, hw head (lown, 
like an old woman: the weight (tf the bucket strained and stiffened 
her thin arms. The iron handle was mnnlang and freezing her little 
wet hands; from time to time she had to stop, aiul every tinu* ,she 
stopped, the cold water that splasht^d from the biu ker ieW ti]H»n her 
naked knees. This took place in the depth of a wood, at iiigljt, in 
the winter, far from all human sight ; it was a v hikl of eiglit years; 
there was none but God at that moment who saw this sad thing. 

And undoubtedly her mother, alas ! 

For there are tlihigs which ujwn the e\es of tlie dead in their 
grave. 

She breathed with a kind of mournful rattle; stibs ciioked her, 
but she did not dare to weep: so fearful was ,s!ie of the l iuhiartiicss, 
even at a distance. She always itnagintti that the 'rheiiartliiss was 
near. 

liowever, she could not make mndi Iieadwa&gt;' in this nmmet\ and 
was getting along very sknvly. She trie&lt;l hard to slaaieii her rest- 
ing spells, and to walk’as far as possible between them. She remem- 
bered with anguish that it would fake Iter more than an luntr to re- 
turn to Montfermeil thus, and that the 'bhtMiat'iliess w tndil !&gt;eat her. 
This anguish added to her dismay at being alone in the wc»tals at 
night. She was worn tmt with fatigue, and was tiot yef oui of the 
fore, St Arriving near an old chestnut trtH* which she knew, slie mutle 
a last halt, longer than the others, to get well rested ; iluai she gath- 
ered all her .strength, Umk up the Intcket again, and began Iti walk 
on courageously, meanwhile the i««»r little despairing thing could 
not help crying: **(&gt;h ! mv Ciod ! my ( Jotl !" 

At that moment she fdt nl! at once t\m the weight of the Inicket 
was gone. A hand, which seemed enonnotis to lier, Itaf! just caught 
the handle, and w^a$ carrying it easily, She raised her head. A large 
dark form, straight and erect, was walking besiile her in the gh*um. 
It was a man who had come U}i behind her, and whom she bad not 
heard. This man, without saying a word, hail grasjKsd the handle of 
the bucket she was carr)»ing. 

There are in.stiiicts for all the crises of life. 

The child was not afraid.

•WHICH PERHAPS 1&gt;R0VES THE INTELLIGENCE OF BOULATEUELLE 
' « 

In the afternoon of that same Christmas-day, 1823, a man walked 
a long time in the most deserted portion of the Boulevard de I’Hopi- 
tal at Paris. This man had the appearance of some one who was 
looking for lodgings, and seemed to stop by preference before the 
most modest houses of this dilapidated part of the Faubourg Saint 
Marceau. 

We shall see further on that this man did in fact hire a room in this 
isolated quarter. 

This man, in his dress as in his whole person, realised the type 
of what might be plied the mendicant of good society— extreme 
inisery being TOmbined_ witli extreme neatness. It is a rare coina- 
dence which inspires intelligent hearts with this double respect 
that we feel for him who is very poor and for him who is very 
worthy. Pie wore a round hat, very old and carefully brushed, a 
long coat, completely threadbare, of coarse yellow cloth, a colour 
which was in nowise extraordinary at that epoch, a large waist- 
coat with pockets of antique style, black trousers worn grey at the 
knees, black woollen stockings, and thick shoes with copper 
buckles. One would have called him an old preceptor of a good 
family, returned from the emigration. From his hair, which was 
entirely white, from his wrinkled brow, from his livid lips, from 
his face in which everything breathed exhaustion and weariness 
of life, one would have supposed him considerably over sixty. 
From his firm though .slow step, and the singular vigour im- 
pressed upon all his motions, one would hardly have thqught him 
fifty. The wrinkles on his forehead were well disposed, and would 
have prepos.sessed in his favour any one who observed him with 
attention. His lip contracted with a strange expression, which 
seemed severe and yet which was humble. There was in the depths 
of his eye an indescribably mournful serenity. He carried in his 
left hand a small package tied in a handkerchief, with his right he 
leaned upon a sort of staff cut from a hedge. This staff had been 
finished with some care, and did not look very badly ; the knots were 
smoothed down, and a coral head had been formed with red wsxj; 
It was a cudgel, and it seemed a cane. , 

There are few people on that boulevard, especially in wiat^* 
i^lThis man appeared to avoid them rather dm j^e^ them, but 
^without affectation. ■ 

At that epoch the king, Louis XVIII., went alraost every day 
Choisy Le Roy. It was one of his fawirife ridbs. About two 
p^’dock, alinost invariably, the. canhi^ and jthe royal cavalcade 



332 L E S M I S !•: R A. H I, E s 

were seen to pass at full speed tliniugii tlie i’xnlevanl de 

I’Hopital. 

This supplied the place of watch and chtek to the poor women 
of the quarter, who would say : “It is two oVlock, there he is going 
back to the Tuileries.” * . . . . 

And some ran, and others fell into line ; for wlien a king passes 
by, there is always a tunuilt. Moreitver, tlu; appearance and dis- 
appearance of Louis XVI 11. produced a certaiii .scnsatiein in the 
streets of Paris. It was rapid, but inajcslic. 'i'his impotent king 
had ata.ste for fa.st driving: not being alile to walk, ho vyishedto 
run; this cripple would have gladly been drawn hv the lightning. 
He pas.sed by, peaceful and severe, in tlu* midst oi' ii:d&lt;ed .sabres. 
His massive coach, all gilded, witli gre.tt lily linineht;s p;iinted on 
the panels, rolled noisily along. One iiardlv had time to catch a 
glance of it. In the Itack corner on the right ctmhl he seen, upon 
cushions covered witli white satin, a liroad iaee, tiriii and red, a 
forehead freshly powdered a la bird of j)ai';nlise, ;i proud eye, 
stern and keen, a well-read smile, two large epaulets of hullion 
waving over a citizen’.s tlre.ss, the tit)Id«'n Meece, the cross of 
Saint Louis, the cros.s of the Legion of ilonour, the silver badge 
of the Holy Sjiirit, a big belly, and ji large blue l iiihon ; that was 
the king. Outside of Paris, lie held his hat witli white feathers 
upon hi.s knees, whicli were incloset! in high Luglisli gaitens; 
when he re-entered the city, lie placed Ids hat uptui hit- heafl, bow- 
ing but little. He looked coldly upon the peitplts, w ho returned his 
look. When he appeared for the tir.st time in the t^htartier .Saint 
Mart'eau. all he succeeded in eliciting was this saying of a re.si- 
dent toiiis comrade: ‘Tt’.s that big fellow wlio is the govenmieiit.’' 

This unfailing passiige of the king at the same hour was then 
the &lt;laily event of the Boulevard dc I'i Idpilal. 

The promenader in the yellow coat evideally riid not belong to 
the quarter, and prohjihly not to Paris, for lie was ignorant of this 
circum.stance. When at two o'clock the royal cari iage, sni rounded 
by a stjuadron of .silver- laced body-gtiani, Uirned into the boule- 
vard, after passing Ln Salpetrierc, he ap}H*ared Mirprisetl, and 
almost frightened. Thererwas no one else in thr eniss alley, and he 
retired hastily behind a corner of tlte side wall, but this diti not 
prevent the Duke d’fhtvr^ seeing him. Tlie Duke d'Havre. as cap- 
tain of the guards in waiting thtit d,iy, was .seated in the carriage 
opixrsite the king. He .ssiid to his majesty: "There i.s a man who 
ha.s a bad look." .Some [Kilieemrn, who vverc clearing the passage 
for the king, also nolieed him; one of them wa.H ordered to follow 
him. But the man plunged into the little sailitary streetH of the 
Faubourg, and as mght was coming on the otficeV lost his track, 
as is est.tblished by a report addresswl on the same evening to the 
Comte Anglis, Minister of State, Prefect of Police. 



C O S E TTE ‘ . 333 

When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the officer off his 
trade, he turned about, not without looking back many times to 
make sure that he was not followed. At a quarter past four, that 
is to say, after dark, he passed in front of the theatre of the Porte 
Saint Martin where the play that day was The Two Convicts. 
The poster, lit up by the reflection from the theatre, seemed to 
strike him, for, although he was walking rapidly, he stopped to 
read it. A moment after, he was in the cul-de-sac de la Planchette, 
and entei'ed the Pewter platter, which was then the office of the 
Lagny stage. This stage started at half past four. The horses were 
harnessed, and the travellers, who had been called by the driver 
hastily, were climbing the high iron steps of the vehicle. 

The man asked : 

“Have you a seat ?” 

“Only one, beside me, on the box,” said the driver. 

“I will take it.” 

“Get up then.” 

Before starting, however, the driver cast a glance at the poor 
apparel of the traveller, and at the smallness of his bundle, and 
took his pay. 

“Are you going through to Lagny?” asked the driver. 

“Yes,” sajd the man. 

The traveller paid through to Lagny. 

They started off. When they had passed the barriere, the driver 
tried .to start a conversation, but the traveller answered only in 
monosyllables. The driver concluded to whistle, and swear at 
his horses. 

The driver wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The 
man did not appear to notice it. In this way they passed through 
Goumay and Neuilly sur Marne. About six o’clock in the evening 
they were at Chelles. The driver stopped to let his horses breathe, 
in front of the waggoners’ tavern established in the old buildings 
of the royal abbey. 

“I will get clown here,” said the man. 

He took his bundle and stick, and jumped down from the 
i stage. 

A moment afterwards he had disappeared. 

He did not go into the tavern. 

, When, a few minutes afterwards, the stage started off for 
.Lagny, it did not overtake him in the main street of Chelles. 

The driver turned to the inside passengers : 

. “There,” said he, “is a man who does not belong here, for I 
don’t know him. He has ao appearance of not having a sou; 
jhowever, he don’t stick about money; he pays to Lagny, and he 
ionly goft« to Chelles. It is night, all the houses are shut, he don 1 



334 L E S M 1 S ft R A B L K S 

go to the tavern, and we ci«iidt t&gt;vt*iiakt' hir.K \\v innst, tlien, have 

sunk into the groiui&lt;l.’' 

The man liad not sunk into the ground, Imt In had hurried 
rapidly in tlic darkness along the main streot nt ( helies; tlien he 
had turned to the left, heiore reaciiiug the ehuivli. itiio tlu‘ cross 
road leading to Wont fernieil, lilo* one who knew the eiuintry and 
had been that way before. 

He followed this road rapidly. At tlu* s|&gt;ot where it intersects 
the old road bordered with trees that g&lt;ns fn nn tlagnv to Lagny, 
he heard footsteps appruaeliing. He etau ealed hiniseh hastily in a 
ditch, and wailed there till the people wlu&gt; wvw passing were a 
good distance off. The precaution was indeed ahnost supertluoiis, 
for, as wc have already said, it was a v(‘i v dark I k*t,'end&gt;er night. 
There were scarcely two or thre«‘ star.s to b(’ set-n in the sky. 

It is at tliis ])oint that the ascent of the hill hepatis. The nmn did 
not return tt) the Mtmtfenueil road : he itirnrd to the right, across 
the fielils, and gained the woods witit ra|&gt;id stiides, 

When he reached the wood, he slackeiied hi.% ten’e, and began 
to look carefully at all the trees, pausing at evesa step, as if he 
were seeking and following a luvsteritnis loutr known only to 
himself, d'here was a nmnient wln-n lie appeared t&lt;» lose liimself, 
and when he sto|)ped, nndecided. hinally he arrived, hv Ciintinttal 
groping, at a glacle wdiere there was a heap of large wlntish stones. 
He made his way ijnickly triwards these st&lt;mes, .md examined 
them with attention in the dusk of the night, as if he were passing 
them in review. A large tree, covereti witli these excrescences 
which are the warts of vegetation, was a tew stetrs fr»nn the heap 
of stones. He went to this tree, ain! pas^a^d !us {mud over tht: bark 
of the trunk, as if he were seeking to rex-ognise ami emmt all 
the warts* 

Opposite tins tree, which was an aslt, ttuna* was a chestmit tree 
wounded in the hark, whit h had heefi j tanm lied vvedi a bandage of 
‘/.in c nailed on. He rose tm tip and fraulied tisat haotl of zinc. 

Then he stamped for .some time upca» the e, round in tlie sprice 
between the tree and the stones, like one wIm* %\n\M he sure that 
the earth had not been freshly stirred. 

Tills done, lie took Ins course and lesmurd his walk tlirough 
the woods. 

This was the man who had fallen in with (V*^enr, 

As he made Ins way through Ihecojee in the ilirei tT»n t»f Mont- 
fcrmeil, he had perceived that little shadow, sirugghmg along with 
a groan, setting her burden on the ground, then taking it up and 
going on again. He had afiprfiaduHi her an&lt;! serf* that it was a 
very young diild carrying an enormous hiirket of water. Thei 
he had gone to the child, and silently taken hold of the hamil'^ 
of the bucket.

COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE UNKNOWN, IN THE DARKNESS 

CosETTE, we have said, was not afraid. 

The man spoke to her. His voice was serious, and was a]tn&amp;,3t 
a whisper. 

“My child, that is very heavy for you which you are carrying 
there." 

Cosette raised her head and answered; 

“Yes, monsieur.” 

“Give it to me,” the man continued, “I will cany it for you.” 

Cosette let go of the bucket. The man walked along with her. 

“It is very heavy, indeed,” said he to himself. Then he added : 

“Little girl, how old are you ?” 

“Eight years, monsieur.” _ 

“And have you come far in this way?” 

“From the spring in the woods.” 

“And are you going far?” 

“A good quarter of an hour from here.” 

The man remained a moment without speaking, then he said 
abruptly : 

“You have no mother then ?” 

“I don’t know,” answered the child. 

Before the man had had time to say a word, she added : 

“I don't believe I have. All the rest have one. For my part, I 
have none.” 

And after a silence, she added : 

“I believe I never had any.” 

The man stopped, put the bucket on the ground, stooped down 
and placed his hands upon the child’s shoulders, making an effort 
to look at her and see her face in the darkness. 

The thin and puny face of Cosette was vaguely outlined in the 
livid light of the sky. ^ 

“What is your name ?” said the man. 

“Cosette." 

It seemed as if the man had an electric shock. He looked at her 
again, then letting go of her shoulders, took up the backet, and 
walked on. 

A moment after, he asked : _ 

“Little girl, where do you live?” 

&gt; "At Montfermeil, if you know it.” 

"It is there that we are going?” 

“Yes, monsieur.” 

He made anothtt pause- then he began : . 



336 L E S M 1 S fe R A li l. E S 

“Who is it that has sent you out into tiic woods alter water at 
this time of night?” 

“Madame Thenardier." 

The man resumed with a lone of voice which he tried to render 
indifferent, but in which there was nevertlieless a singular tremor: 

“What does she do, your Madame 'I’heiKirdiiirr" 

“She is my mistress,” said the cliild. "Slie keeps tiie tavern.” 

“The taveni,” said the m:m. "Well, I am going there to lodge 
to-night. Shove me the way.” 

“We are going there,” said the child. 

The man walked very fast. Cosette htllowed him without diffi- 
culty. She felt fatigue no more, 'h’rojn time to time, she rai.seil her 
eyes towards this man with a .sort of trauiiuiiliiy and inexpressible 
confidence. She had never been taught to turn towards ! 'rovidence 
and to pray. However, .she felt in her hosoin something that re- 
sembled hope and joy, aiul which rose lowarils heaven, 

A few minutes pa.ssed. The man .spoke: 

“Is there no servant at Madame Tiieiuu'dkT'sr" 

“No, monsieur.” ^ 

“Are you alone?” 

“Yes, monsieur.” 

There was another interval of silence, t'osetfe raised her voice: 

“That is, there are two little girls.” 

“What little girls?" 

“Ponine and Zelma." 

The child simplified in this way the ronuujiie names tlear to 
the mother. 

“What are Ponine and Zelma ?" 

“They arc Madame Theitardier’s young ladies, you might say 
her daughters.” 

“And what do they do ?” 

"Oh!” said the cliild, "they have lieauiiful dolls, things which 
there’s gold in; they are full of husiucss. They |day, they amuse 
themselves." 

“All day long?" 

“Yes, monsieur." 

“And you ?” 

“Me! I work,” 

“All day long?” 

The chilli raised her large eyes iti which tliere was a fear, which 
could not he seen in the darkness, and answered softly; 

“Yes, monsieur," 

She coijtimied after an interval of .silence ; 

“Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they arc willing, 
{ amuse myself also." 

“How do you amuse yourself?" 



C O S E T TE 337 

“The best I can. They let me alone. But I have not many play- 
things. Ponine and Zelraa are not willing forjne to play with, 
their dolls. I have only a little lead sword, not longer than that.” 

The child showed her little finger. 

“And which does not cut ?” 

“Yes, monsieur,” said the child, “it cuts lettuce and flies’ 
heads.” 

They reached the village ; Cosette guided the stranger through 
the streets. They passed by the bakery, but Cosette did not think 
of the bread she was to have brought back. The man questioned 
her no more, and now maintained a mournful silence. When they 
had passed the church, the man, seeing all these booths in the 
street, asked Cosette: 

“Is it fair-time here!” 

“No, monsieur, it is Christmas.” 

As they drew near the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm : 

“Monsieur?” 

“What, my child?” 

“Here we are close by the house.” 

“Well?” 

“Will you let me take the bucket now ?” 

“What for?” 

“Because, if madame sees that anybody brought it for me, she 
will beat me.” 

The man gave her the bucket. A moment after they were at the 
door of the chop-house. ' 


VIII 

INCONVENIENCE OF ENTF.RTAINING A POOR MAN WHO IS 
PERHAPS RICH 

Cosette could not help casting one look towards the grand doll 
still displaye'S in the toy-shop, then she rapped. The door opened. 
The Thenardiess appeared with a candle in her hand. 

“Oh ! it is you, you little beggar I Lud-a-massy ! you have taken 
your time ! she has been playing, the wench !” 

“Madame,” said Cosette, trembling, “there is a gentleman who 
is coming to lodge.” 

The Thdnardiess very quickly replaced her fierce air by her 
amiable grimace, a change at sight peculiar to innkeepers, and 
looked for the new-comer with eager eyes. 

"Is it monsieur?” said she. ' 

“Yes, madaraej” answered the man, touching Ids bait.

spots could be distinguished, which indicated the places where 
the Thenardiess had touched her. Her naked legs were red and 
rough. The hollows under her collar bones would make one weep, 
The whole person of this child, her gait, her attitude, the sound of 
her voice, the intervals between one word and another, her looks, 
her silence, her least motion, expressed and uttered a single idea ! 
fear. 

Fear was spread all over her ; she was, so to say, covered with 
it; fear drew back her elbows against her sides, drew her heels 
under her skirt, made her take the least possible room, prevented 
her from breathing more than was absolutely necessary, and had 
become what might be called her bodily habit, without possible 
variation, except of increase. There was in the depth of her eye 
an expression of astonishment mingled with terror. 

This fear was such that on coming in, all wet as she was, 
Cosette had not dared go and dry herself by the fire, but had 
gone silently to her work. 

The expression of the countenance of this child of eight years 
was habitually so sad and sometimes so tragical that it seemed, 
at certain moments, as if she were in the way of becoming an 
idiot or a demon. 

Never, as we have said, had she known what it is to pray, 
never had she set foot within a church. “How can I spare the 
time?” said the Thenardiess. 

The man in the yellow coat did not take his eyes from Cosette. 

Suddenly, the Thenardiess exclaimed out : 

“Oh ! I forgot ! that bread 1” 

Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thenardiess 
raised her voice, sprang out quickly from under the table. 

She had entirely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the 
expedient of children who are always terrified. She lied. 

“Madame, the baker was shut.” 

‘ You ought to have knocked.” 

“I did knock, madame." 

“Well?” 

“He didn’t open." 

“I’ll find out to-morrow if that is true,” said the Thenardiess, 
"and if you are lying you will lead a pretty dance. Meantime give me 
back the fifteen-sous piece.” 

Cosette plunged her hand into her apron pocket, and tuimed 
white. The fifteen-soqs piece was not there. 

"Come,” said the Thenardiess, "didn’t you hear me ?'” 

Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing there. 
What could have become of that money? The little wifortunate 
could not utter a word. She was petrifte4^„ , , „ 



340 L E S M I S 6 R A n I - u s 

“Have you lost it, the fifteen-sous piece .'"' screamed the Then- 
ardiess, “or do you want to steal it fniin me 

At the same time she reached her arm imvards tlie cowhide 
hanging in the chimney corner. 

This menacing movement gave Cosette the strength to cry out; 

“Forgive me ! Madame ! Madame! I won’t do .so any more!” 

The Thenardiess took down the whip. 

Meanwhile the man in the yellow coal li.ad Iieen fumhling in his 
waistcoat pocket, without being noticed. 'I'he other travellers were 
drinking or playing cards, and paid no attention to anything. 

Cosette was writhing with anguish in the chitnney-eornea-. trying 
to gather up and hide her poor halt-naked lii!i!i.s. I lie 'I henardiess 
raised her arm. 

“I heg your pardon, madaine,” said the man. "but 1 just now 
saw something fall out of the pochet of that little girl's tipron 
and roll away. That may he it." 

At the .same time he stooped down and iip|»earetl to search on 
the lloor for an instant. 

“Just so, here it is,” saknie, rising. _ 

And he handotl a silver piece to the Thenardiess. 

“Yes, that is it,” saiil .she. 

That was not it, for it was a twenty-sons piece, hut tlie Then- 
ardie.ss found her profit in it. .'she }&lt;iit the pii'ee in her pueket, and 
contented herself with casting a ferocious look at the child and 
saying; 

“Don’t let that hapj&gt;en again, ever." 

Cosette went hack to what the Thenardiess ealleil "her Itole," and 
her large eye, fixed upon the tinknown traveller, hegaii to assume 
an exprcs.sion that it had never known before. It was still only an 
artless a.stonishment, but a sort of blind cotifulence wa.s associated 
with it. 

“O ! yon want supper ?" asked the Thenardies.s of the traveller. 

He did not answer. He seemed to k- tliinkiiig deej ily. 

“What is that man?" said .slu* Iwlween her teeth. “It i.s .some 
frightful pau{x:r. Heh.asn’t a penny for his supper. Is he going to 
pay me for his lodging only ? It is very hteky, anyway, that he didn’t 
think to steal the tnoney that was oti the fliHir.” 

A door nowoiteneti, and Eponineand .\/ehiia eatne in. 

They were really two pretty little girls, r.iilicr city girls tluin 
ptusanks, very charmhig, one with her well-polished aiil'ntrtt ires.'&gt;es, 
the other with her long hlack braids falling down her hack, and hith 
so lively, neat, plump, fresh, and healthy, that It was a [deasiire to 
see them. They were warmly clad. Imt with .sneh m.iieriial art. that 
thethkknc.ss of the stuff detracted nothing from the crKpietry t»f the 
fit. Winter wa.s provided against without effacing spring. These two 
'ittle girls .shed light around them. Moreover, they were regnant. In 



COSETTE 341 

their toilet, in their gaiety, in the noise they made, there was sov- 
ereignty. When they entered, the Thenardiess said to them in a 
scolding tone, which was full of adoration ; “Ah ! you are here then, 
you children !” 

Then, taking them upon her knees one after the other, smoothing 
their hair, tying over their ribbons, and finally letting them go with 
that gentle sort of shake which is peculiar to mothers, she ex- 
claimed : 

“Are they dowdies !” 

They went and sat down by the fire. They had a doll which they 
turned backwards and forwards upon their knees with many pretty 
prattlings. From time to time, Cosette raised her eyes from her knit- 
ting, and looked sadly at them as they were playing. 

Eponine and Azelma did not notice Cosette. To them she was like 
the dog. These three little girls could not count twenty-four years 
among them all, and they already represented all human society ; on 
one side envy, on the other disdain. 

The doll of the Thcnardier sisters was very much faded, and very 
old and broken ; and it appeared none the less wonderful to Cosette, 

. who had never in her life had a doll, a real doll, to use an expression 
that all children will understand. 

All at once, the Thenardiess, who was continually going and com- 
ing about tlie room, noticed that Cosette’s attention was distracted, 
and that instead of working .she was busied with the little girls who 
were playing. 

“Ah ! I’ve caught you !” criecl she. “That is the way you work ! 
I’ll make you work with a cowhide, I will.” 

The stranger, without leaving his chair, turned towards the The- 
nardies.s. 

“Madame,” said he, smiling diffidently. “Pshaw ! let her play !” 

On the part of any traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton, and 
drunk two bottles of wine at hi.s supper, and who had not had the 
appearance of a horrid pauper, such a wish would have been a com- 
mand. But that a man who wore that hat should allow himself to 
have a desire, and that a man who wore that coat should permit him- 
self to have a wish, was what the Thenardiess thought ought not to be 
tolerated. She rqdied sharply : 

“She must work, for she eats. I don’t support her to do nothing.” 

“What is it she is making?” said the stranger, in that gentle voice 
which contrasted so strangely with his beggar’s clothes and his por- 
ter’s .shoulders. 

The Thenardiess deigned to answer. 

“Stockings, if you please. Stockings for my little prls who have 
none, worth speaking of, and will soon be goim barefooted.” 

Tlw man looked at Cosette’s poor red fe*t, and continued : 

“When will she finish that pair of stockings?"' 



342 L K S MIS K R A r&gt; I . K s 

*‘lt will take her at least three or fnur days, tlu* ]a/y tiling/' 
''And how much might this pair of stockings he worth, wiutn it is 
finished 

The 'riicnardiess cast a disdained glance at liim. 

"At least thirty sous," 

"Would you take five francs for theni?" said tiu' man. 
"Goodness!" exclaimed a waggoner who was hsttming, with a 
horse-laugh, "five francs? it’s a Immhug ! live hnllets !” 

Thenardier nowtiiought it time to speak. 

'‘Yes, monsieur, if it is your fancy, you can have* that pair ^f 
stockings for live francs. We can’t reiu'-e anythiug, to travi lhu's/’ 
"You must pay for them now/’ said the Tlu*narilie&gt;&lt;. in hen* short 
^ and pereiniitorv way. 

"I will buy that pair of stockiiyfgs/’ auswerrtl the man, "and," 
added, he, drawing a live franc piece froni his pin hot and laying it 
on the table, "I will ])ay for them." 

Then he turned towards Gosette. 

"Now your work belongs to nu*, I1;iy, :ny cluld/’ 

The waggoner was so alfected by the live franc jtiree, th.ai he left 
his glass and went to look at it. 

"It’s so, tliat’s a fact !" (*ried hey as he lookrd at it. “A regular 
hindwlieel ! and no counterfeit !" 

Tiienardier apjiroachetl, and silently put fhc'phse in Ins jiucket. 
The Hieuaniiess had nothing to rejjiy She hit licr lips, and her 
face asstimed an expression of hatred. 

Meanwhile Coset le Iremhletl She ventured to a^k : 

"Madame, is it true? can I play r" 

"Play!" said the Hienardiess in a terrible voiety 
"Thank you, matlaimy" said C Ysettc^. Aftd, while her mouth 
thankalthelluhKualiess.all her little soul was thankusg the traveller, 
Thenardier returned to his drink. His wife whispered iu his ear: 
"What can that yellow man he?" 

"1 have seen," answeret! ’rhenardier. in a r^annnandingtiUuy "mil- 
lionaires with coats like that." 

C oseUc had left her knitting, hut she Irel not inovrd froiti her 
place. G&gt;st?tte always stirred as little as was pn^ alde. She had taken 
from a little box hehimlljer a few olil raiyy and Iter little lead sword.

w^as engaged in ihi:: .serious am! &lt;liffndt labour, she was talking to 
her sister in that sm^et and charming language of ctnl^lren* the grace 
of which, like the splendour of the himertly s wings, eseaiies when 
we try to preserve it. 



COSET TE 343 

“Look ! look, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She 
moves, she cries, she is warm. Come, sister, let us play with her. 
She shall be my little girl ; I will be a lady. I’ll come to see you, and 
you must look at her. By and by you must see her whiskers, and you 
must be surprised. And then you must sec her ears, and then you 
must see her tail, and that will astonish you. And you must say to 
me: 'Oh! my stars!’ and I will say to you, ‘Yes, madame, it is a 
little girl that I have like that.' Little girls are like that now.” 

Azclma listened to Eponine with wonder. 

Meanwhile, the drinkers were singing an obscene song, at which 
they laughed enough to shake the room. Thcnardier encouraged and 
accomimnied them. 

As birds make a^nest of anything, children make a doll of no mat- 
ter what. While Eponine and Azelina were dressing up the cat, 
Cosette, for her part, had dressed up tlic sword. 'J'hat done, .she had 
laid it upon her arm, and was singing it softly to sleep. 

The doll is one of the most imperious necessities, and at the saifie 
time one of the most charming instinct.s of female childhood. To 
care for, to clothe, to adorn, to dress, to imdre.ss, to dress over 
again, to teach, to .scold a little, to rock, to cuddle, to put to sleep, to 
imagine that something is somebody^ — all the future of woman is 
there. Even while musing and prattling, while making little ward- 
robes and little baby-clothes, while sewing little dresses, little bod- 
ices, and little jackets, the child fjecomes a little girl, the little girl 
becomes a great girl, the great girl becomes a woman. The first 
baby takes the place of the last dull. 

A little girl without a doll is almo.&lt;!t as unfortunate and quite as 
impossible as a woman without children. 

Cosette had therefore made a doll of her sword. 

ITie Thenardiess, on her jmrt, approached the yellow man. "My 
husband is right," thought she ; “it may be Monsieur Laffitte. Some 
rich men are so odd.” 

She came and rested her elbow on the table at which he was sil^ 
ting. 

“Monsieur,'' said she — 

At this word monsicar, the man turned. The Thenardiess had 
called him before only brave man or ffood man. 

“You see, monsieur,” she pur.suetl, putting on her sweetest look 
which was still more unendurable than her ferocious manner, “i 
am very willing the child should play, I am not opposed to it; it k 
weH for once, because you are generous. But, you see, she is poor; 
she must work.” 

“The child is not yours, then?" asked the inaa. 

“Oh dear! no, monsieur t It is a little pauper that we have taken 
in through charity. A sort of imbecile child. She mast have water 
on her bi^. Her h«id is h&gt;g, as We do all we can for her, 



344 L E s M I S E R A U L E S 

but we are not rich. Wc write in vain to iu-r cnuulry ; Itu- .six months 

we have had no answer. We think that her mother mn&gt;t Ite dead." 

“Ah !” said the man, and lie fell h.iek into his reverie. 

“This mother was no ftreat things," atlded the 1 heiianliess. “She 
abandoned her child.” _ .... 

During all this conver.sation, fosetle, as if an mstinei had warned 
her that they were talking ahotit her, had nut t.ikeii her eyes from 
the Thenardiess. She li.steneil. She heard :i few words here and 
there. 

Meanwhile the drinkers, all llirce^^juartiTs ilrtiiik, Wf*r(* rcjwat- 
ing their foul chorus wulh rcdouhlrd gauly, It was hit;hiy s|)iccd 
with jests, in which the names of llu* and tlu* eliiitl Jesus 

were often heard. The 'Fhenardiess had tu take her part in the 
hilarity. Cosette, under the table, was !t*t»kiu;,t intt&gt; tlir tire, which 
was reflected from luT fixed eye; she was aj:;aui roekiu;,; the sort of 
rag baby that she had made, and as she roeluMi u, she .sau^ in alow 
voice; ‘‘My mother is dead! mv mother i.s (had! luv mother is 
dead!" 

At the repeated entreaties of the lite 4 (‘NS, the yet!e»w man, "the 
millionaire," finally consented t(»su[i. 

"What will monsieur have?" 

"Some liread and cheese," said the man. 

".Decidedly, it is a beggar,** Uiotighf the lliejKUs!ie,«-&gt;. 

The revellers continued to sing llieir songs, and the, child, under 
the also sung hers. 

All at once, Cosette stopped. She liad just turned am! seen the 
little Thvhiardiers* doll, wdiich they h.»d lor^aloii tor the cat and 
left on the floor, a few steps from llte kitchen table, 

Then she let tiie bundled-ttp sword, that only lialf satisfied her, 
fall, and ran her eyt‘s slowly arotuid the roomv ITa* d’henardiess 
was whisjKring to her hu?dmml and cimming sonte mone&gt;', i%|»onme

knees, madt* sure once more tliat nohady was walchiiig Iter, then 
darted ciuickly to the doll, and seiml it. An iuNtatu afterwards she 
was at her place, seated, motiimless, only hintinl in sin h a way as 
to keep the did] that she hekl in her iirnis in the shaffow. d lie happb 
ness of idiiving with a doll was sri rare to her tltat it Imd all the 
violence of rapture, 

Nobody had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly eat- 
ing his meagre snppen 

This joy lasted for nearly a quarter of an hour, 

But ill sjdte of Cosette’s precautioiiH, she did itoi jierceivr tliat one

it UP very vividly. Thii ra»v and hiiuiitom {m*l which protriided

from the shadow suddenly caught Azelma’s eye, and she said to 
Eponine : “Oh ! sister !” 

The two little girls stopped, stupefied ; Cosette had dared to take 
the doll, 

Eponine got up, and without letting go of the cat, went to her 
mother and began to pull at her skirt. 

“Let me alone,” said the mother; “what do you want?” 

“Mother,” said the child, “look there.” 

And she pointed at Cosette. 

Cosette, wholly ahsox’bed in the ecstasy of her possession, saw 
and heard nothing else. 

The face of the Thenardiess assumed the peculiar expression 
which is composed of the terrible mingled with the commonplace 
and which has given this class of women the name of furies. 

This time wounded pride exasperated her anger still more. Cos- 
ette had leaped over all barriers. Cosette had laid her hands upon 
the doll of “those young Iadic.s.” A czarina who had seen a moujik 
trying on the grand cordon of her imperial son would have had the 
same expression. 

She cried with a voice har.sh with indignation ; 

“Cosette!” 

Cosette .shuddered as if the earth had quaked beneath her. She 
turned around. 

“Cosette !” repeated the Thenardiess. 

Cosette took the doll and placed it gently on the floor with a kind 
of veneration mingled with de.spair. Then, without taking away her 
eyes, .she joined her hands, and, what is frightful to tell in a child 
of that age, she wrung them ; then, what none of the emotions of 
the day had drawn from her, neither the run in the wood, nor the 
weight of the bucket of water, nor the loss of the money, nor the 
sight of the cowhide, nor even the stern worths .she had heard from 
the Thenardies.s, .she burst into tears. She soblxed. 

Meanwhile the traveller aro.se. 

“What is the matter?" .said he to the Thenardiess. 

“Don’t you see sakl the Thenardiess, pointing with her finger 
to the corpus dclicH lying at Cosette’.s feet. 

“Well, what is that ?” said the man. 

“That begg-ar," answered the Thenardiess, “has dared to touch 
the children’s doll." 

“All this noise about that ?" said the man. “Well, what if she did 
play with that doll ?" 

“She has touched it with her dirty hands 1” continued the Thdnar* 
diess, “with her horrid hands r 

Here Cosette redoubled her sobs. 

“Be still t" cried the 'Ihinardiess. 



346 1. K s M 1 s k K A n u k s 

The man walked straight io the street dansr, npened it, and went 
out. 

As soon as he had gone, the Tluhiardiess proiut^rl |iy his abselice 
to give Coseltc under the table a severe kiek, \vhi( h made the child 
shriek. 

The door opened agaiit, and the inuu reapp&lt;*ared. htddirig in his 
hands the fabulous doll of wiiich we iiave spoken, ;md winch had 
been the admiration of all the yeaingsters ot tiu:' viliagi* since morn- 
ing; he stood it up before C’t)seUe, saving: 

“Here, this is for you." 

It is})rol)ahle that &lt;lur!ng the time he liad been there- more than 

an hour — in the midst of his reverie, he hati eat:;;!it ( » ntmsed glimp- 
sesof this toy-shop, lighted up with lamps mal eaialb's so splendklly 
that it shone through the har-rcHuti wimlow like an illumination. 

Coseite raised licr eyes; she saw tlie man a|&gt;proaeh her with that 
doll as she would have seen the sun appri^ach, she hc‘ard thi)se as- 
tounding words: 7ViW ?V /or veto She basked at him. slie looked at 
the doll, then she drew hack sbnvly, and went an«l hid as far as she 
could nmler the table in the corner oi the room. 

She wept no more, she crieti im more, she had the ap|&gt;f‘arance of 
no longer tiaring to breathe. 

The d'henardiess, Kponine, atui Ar.elma were so m.my statues. 
Even tiu* drinkers sttippied. 'Fliere w;is a Ni lmm silentT in tlu? whole 
bar-room. 

The Theiiardiess, petrihcil and mute, reciatmnnued lier eonjec- 
tures anew: ‘AVhat is this tdtl felliov ? is lu* a |&gt;auper ? i ; he a mit- 
Honairt!? I\n*haps lies both, tliat is a rohher." 

The face of the fuishaml Thcnardier (Urcsetttn! t!;at expressive

Coarse natures have this in common widi artless natures, that 
they have no trunsitions.

sky in the breaking of tlie dawn, with strange radiations of joy 
What she experienced at that moment was almost like what she 
would have felt is some one had said to her suddenly : Little girl 

• you are queen of France.. ^ ’ 

It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, thunder would 
; Spring forth from it. 

Which was true to some extent, for she thought that the Thenar- 
diess would scold and beat her. 

■ However, the attraction overcame her. She finally approached and 

timidly murmured, turning towards the Thenardiess :■ 

“Can I, madame?” 

No expression can describe her look, at once full of despai.r dis- 
may, and transport. ' 

“Good Lord !” said the Thenardiess, “it is yours. Since monsieur 
gives it to you.” 

“Is it true, is it true, monsieur?” said Cosette; “is the lady for 

• me ?” 

The stranger appeared to have his eyes full of tears. He seemed 
to be at that stage of emotion in which one does not speak for fear 
of weeping. He nodded assent to Cosette, and put the hand of "the 
lady” in her little hand. 

Cosette withdrew her hand ha-stily, as if that of the lady burned 
her, and looked down at the floor. We are compelled to add, thatt 
at that instant she thrust out her tongue enormously. All at once she 
turned, and seized the doll eagerly. 

“I will call her Catharine," said -she. 

It was a strange moment when Cosette’s rags met and pressed - 
against the ribbons and the fresh pink musHns of the doll. 

“Madame,” .said she, “may I put her in a chair ?” 

"Yes, my child,” answered the Thteardiess. 

It was Eponine and Azelma now who looked upon Cosette with 
'envy. 

Cosette placed Catharine on a chair, then sat down on the floor 
before her, and remained motionless, without -saying a word, in the 
attitude of contemplation. 

“Why don’t you play, Co.sette ?’’ said the stranger. 

"Oh ! I am playing," answered the child. 

This stranger, this unknown man, who seemed like a visit ftnm 
Providence to Cosette, was at that moment the beiiw^whito tiiii 
Thenardiess hated more than aught else in the world. Hwc¥ei', s3«s 
was compelled to restrain herself. Her emotions were more iSmm 
she coqld endure, accustomed as she was to dissimulation, by en- 
deavouring to copy her husband in all her actions. She sent her 
daughters to bed immediately, then asked the ydlow man’s perms^ 
iwM to send Cosette to bed— wlw is very firm io~day, added she.

with a motherly air. Cosette went In l»ed, laildirtit' iVuliarine in her 

arms. 

The Thenardiess went fnmi time to time tu tlie other end of the 
room, where her husband was, /o ,voo//n’ /n*r .Vf»n/, she s.iid. She ex- 
changed a few words with him, which wore the nun'i* furious that 
she did not dare to speak tluau aknui : — 

' *'The old fool ! what has he got into his head, to come here to dis- 
turb UvS ! to want that little monster to jday ! ti) ^'Jve her dtdls ! to give 
forty-franc dolls to a slut that ! Winddnh give forty sttiis for. A 
little more, and he wottld say y&lt;ntr majesty \m her, as they tha to the 
Duchess of Berry ! Is he in his sensi*s ? he tttust in* t ra/v, the strange 
old fellow r 

**Why? It is very simple/* rejtlieii 1'hrnardier. **If it amuses him! 
It amuses you for the girl 1o wcu'k : it amu&gt;es him t&lt;*r her to play. 
He hawSlhe riglit to do it. A traveller caft do^as he likes, if la* p^yg 
for it If this old fellow is a philanthropist, what is tliai it) ytm?*if 
he is craxy it don*t coiicern you. W hat tlo yuu inter ftu’e for, us long 
as he has money ?’* 

Language of a master and rcasoiting i&gt;f ati imikeeijcr, which 
neither in one case nor tlte other atlniiis t»f reply. 

The man had leaned his elbows on the tattle, am! resumed his at- 
titude of reverie. All the other iraveiiers, jnslku s, ami waggoners, 
had drawn hack a little, and sung n»» ittore, Ttiey looked upon him 
from a distance witli a sort of respectful fear. 

This solitary man, m potndy clad, win* to):)k five- franc pieces 
from his pocket with so much itulifTerence, am! who lavislied gigan- 
tic dolls on little brat.s in wooden shoes^ wa ^ certainly a magnilkent 
and formidable goodman. 

Several hours passetl rway. ddie mifiriiglit mass was saick the revel 
was finished, lluMlrinkcrs harl gone, tlie hoti.e was closed, the room 
was deserted, the lire had gone out, the stranger still remained in 
the same place and in the .same posture, hhom lime n&gt; time he 
changed the elliow on which lie rested. *1 hat was all. Ihit he had not 
spoken a word since (/osette was gone. 

The 'rhihianiiers alone out of projiriety and curiosity, had re- 
mained in the room. 

“Is he gtiiiifi to spend t!»e ni«ht !ikr tins ?" wnunhled fhe Thenar- 
diess. When the eloek struck two in the niurniin;, &gt;h»’ ackiittwledgwi 
herself hejiten.niiil siiid to her hnshand ; "I atn H'Mitfj to hed, you niay 
do as you like," 1 he hushund sal th&gt;wn at a tahle in a corner, lighted 
a candle, an«i hegrm t» rc.td the Coumt'r /‘Vinnin'r. 

A good Innir passed thus. Tlte worthy imtkeejwr had read the 
CoitrrtW /•runoti.v at least tltree times, from the «!atr of the numl«r 
to the mine of the printer. Tlie stranger did imt stir, 

i henardier moved, eoughetl, .sjiit, Idew his nose, ami err.akc(l his 



€0S£mi 349 

chair. The man did not stir. ‘‘Is he asleep ?’’ thought Thenardier. 
The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him. 

Finally, Thenardier took off his cap, approached softly, and vem 
- tured to say : — 

“Is monsieur not going to repose 

Not going to bed would have seemed to him too much and too 
familiar. To repose implied^ luxury, and there was respect in it. 
Such words have the mysterious and wonderful property of swell- 
ing the bill in the morning. A room in which you go to bed costs 
twenty sous ; a room in which you repose costs twenty francs. 

“Yes,"' said the stranger, “you are right. Where is your stable?” 

“Monsieur,” said Thenardier, with a smile, “I will conduct mon- 
sieur.” 

He took the candle, the man took his- bundle and his staff, and 
Thenardier led him into a room on the first floor, which was very 
showy, furnished all in mahogany, with a high-post bedstead and 
red calico curtains. 

“What is this ?” said the traveller. 

“It is properly our bridal chamber,” said the innkeeper. “We oc- 
cupy another like this, my spouse and I ; this is not open more than 
three or four times in a year.” 

“I should have liked the stable as well,” said the man, bluntly. 

Thenardier did not appear to hear this not very civil answer. 

He lighted two entirely new wax candles, which were displayed 
upon the mantel ; a good fire was blazing in the fireplace. There was 
on the mantel, under a glass case, a woman’s head-dress of silver 
thread and orange-flowers. 

“What is this ?” said the stranger. 

“Monsieur,” said Thenardier, “it is my wife’s bridal cap.” 

The traveller looked at the object with a look which seemed to 
say: “there was a moment, then, when this monster was a virgin.” 

Thenardier lied, however. When he hired this shanty to turn it 
into a chop-house, he found the room thus furnished, and bought 
this furniture, and purchased at second-hand these orange-flowers, 
thinking that this would cast a gracious light over “his spouse,” and 
that the house would derive from them what the English call re- 
spectability. 

When the traveller turned again the host had disappeared. The- 
nardier had discreetly taken himself out of the way without daring 
to say good-night, not desiring to treat with a disrespectful cordial- 
ity a man whom he proposed to skin royally in the morning. 

The innkeeper retired to his room ; his wife was in bed, but not 
asleep. When she heard her husband’s step, she turned towards him 
and said: 

“You know that I am going to kick Cosette out doors to-mor- 
rc)wl” 



350 LES mis^:rables 

Th&amp;iardier coolly answered : 

“You are, indeed 1” 

They exchanged no further words, and in a few moments theii 
candle was blown out. 

For his part, the traveller had put his staff ami Inindk in a corner. 
The host gone, he sat down in an arm-chair, and remained some 
time thinking. Then he drew off his shoes, took t)ne of the two can- 
dles, blew out the other, pushed open tlie do&lt;ir, and went out of the 
room, looking about liim as if he were searching for something. He 
passed through a hall, and came to the stairway. 'I'here he heard a 
very soft little sound, which rescnihled the breathing of a child. 
Guided by this sound he came to a sort of tri,angular nook built 
under the stairs, or, rather, formed Ijy the staircase itself. This hole 
was nothing but the space beneath the stairs, 'i'here, ;unong all .sorts 
of old baskets and old rubbish, in the dust and tunong the cobwebs, 
there was a bed ; if a mattress so full of holes as to sluivv the .straw, 
and a covering so full of holes as to show the mattress, can be called 
abed. There were no .sheets. This was placed on the floor immedi- 
ately on the tiles. In this bed Cosette was sleeping. 

Ihe man approached and lookol at her. 

Cosette was sleeping .sounilly : she w.as dressed. In the winter .she 
did not undress on account of the c&lt;dd, .She held the doll clasped in 
her arms ; its large o])en eyes shone in tin; ohsenrity, h'rom time to 
time she heaved a deep sigh, as if she were about to wake, and she 
hugged the doll almost convulsively. There was only one of her 
wooden shoes at the side of her l&gt;ed. An open dimr near C«jsette’s 
nook disclosed a large dark room. The stranger entered. At the fur- 
ther end, through a glass window, he perceived two little beds with 
very white spreads. They were tho.se of Azelnia and Ejainine. Half 
Md behind these beds was a willow cradle witiiout eurttiins, in which 
the little boy who had cried all the evening wtis sleejung. 

The stranger conjectured tiiat this rootn communicated with that 
of the Thenardiers. He was alwutl to withdraw when his eye fell 
upon the fireplace, one of those huge tavern fireplaces wliere there 
is always so little fire, when there Ls .*i fire, and which tire so cold to 
look upon. In this one there wa.s no lire, there were not even any 
ashes. What there was, however, attracted tlie traveller's attention. 
It was two little children’.s shoes, of coqta-ltisli slinpe and of differ- 
ent sizes. The traveller remembered the graceful and immemorial 
castom of children putting their shoes in tlie fire|»lace on t ‘hristmas 
night, to wait there in the darkness in exju'ctalion f»f some shining 
gift from their goo&lt;l fairly. Eponinc and Azelma had taken good 
care not to forget this, ami each had put one of her shoes in the fire- 
place. 

The traveller bent over them. 



COSETTE 351 

The fairy— that is to say, the mother— had already made her visit, 
and shining in each shoe was a beautiful new ten-sous piece. 

The man rose up and was on the point of going away, when he 
perceived further along, by itself, in the darkest corner of the fire- 
place, another object. He looked, and recognised a shoe, a horrid 
wooden shoe of the clumsiest sort, half broken and covered with 
ashes and dried mud. It was Cosette -s shoe. Cosette, with that touch-- 
ing confidence of childhood which can always be deceived without 
ever being discouraged, had also placed her shoe in the fireplace. 

What a sublime and sweet thing is hope in a child who has 
never known anything but despair ! 

There was nothing in this wooden shoe. 

The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over, and dropped 
into Cosette's shoe a gold Louis. 

Then he went back to his room with stealthy tread.

THiNARDIER MANCEUVRING 

On the following morning, at least two hours before day, Thenar-^ 
dier, seated at a table in the bar-room, a candle by his side with pen 
in hand, was making out the bill of the traveller in the yellow coat. 

His wife was standing, half bent over him, following him with 
her eyes. Not a word passed between them. It was, on one side, a 
profound meditation, on the other that religious admiration with 
^ which we observe a marvel of the human mind spring up and expand. 
A noise was heard in the house ; it was the lark, sweeping the stairs. 

After a good quarter of an hour and some erasures, Thenardi^r 
produced this masterpiece,.

^*Monsiuer Thenardier, you are right* he clc*serves it,” murmured 
the woman, thinking of the doll giveii to »sette in the i&gt;rcsence of 
her daughters ; “it is right! hut it’s to&lt;&gt; nuieh. He won’t pay it.” 

Thenardier put on his cold laugli, and saiil : “i le will jxty it.” 

This laugh was the highest sign of certainty and authority. What 
was thus said, must be. The woman did not insist. She began to ar- 
range the tables; the husband walked back and forth in the room, 
A moment after he added : 

“I owe, at least, fifteen lumdrecl francs!” 

He seated himself thoughtfully in the chimney crumer, his feet k 
the warm ashes. 

“Ah ha!” replied the woman, “yoti don’t ft»rget that 1 kick Cos- 
ette out of the house t&lt;Hda)i? M he ntiuistcr ! it tears my vitals to see 
her with her doll ! I would ratlter marry I .otiis X \' 11 1 . than keep her 
in the house another day !” 

Thenardier lighted his pipe, and answercil between twtv i&gt;uifs: 

“You’ll give the bill to the man.” 

Then he went out. 

He was scarcely (utt of tlu? room when the travelb-r came in. 

Thenardier ri‘a[)peared immeiiiately ludtind him, aittl remained 
motionless in the half-ijpen door, visible only to bis wife. 

Thcyelli&gt;w man carried his staff and !nnn!!e in his haUib 

“Up so soon !” sai&lt;i the d’henartliess ; motisiettr going to leave

To present such a hill to a man w!ti* had so perfectly t!te appear- 
ance of “a pauper” seemed loo awkward to her. 

The traveller appeared pre-nccupietl and at^senMninded, 

He answered : 

“Yes, niadame, I am going away.” 

“Monsieur, then, had no inisiness at Montfenneil?” rejdied she. 

“No, I am passing through; that is all, Madanug” added he, 
“what do I imeT* 

The Tluhiardiess, withtnit answering, handed him the folded bill 

The man unfolded the |»aper and looked at it; Imu his thoughts 
were evidently elsewhere, 

“Madame, * replied he, “do v&lt;‘U do a govid Imsines^ in Montfer* 
meil?” 

“So-.so, monsirmr.” answered \h* d iH'tmrdieNS, NtujMdied at seeing 
no other explosiciu. 

She continued in a moiirnfiil mul lamenting straitt : 

^ “Oh ! nninsicnr, the times are very hanl, and llien wi* have so few 
rich people anmiid here! It is a very little jilare, you see. if we only 



COSETTE 353 

had rich travellers now and then, like monsieur! We have so manv 

expenses ! Why, that little girl eats us out of house and home ” 

“What little girl?” cum nome. 

“Why, the little girl you know I Cosette ! the lark, as they call her 
about here 1 

“Ah 1” said the man. 

She continued: 

“How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames ! She looks 
more like 3 . bs-t thsii a lark. You see, monsieur, we don^t ask charity 
but we are not able to give it. We make nothing, and have a great 
deal to pay. The licence, the excise, the doors and windows, the tax 
on everything I Monsieur knows that the government demands a 
deal of money. And then I have my own girls. I have nothing to 
spend on other people’s children.” 

The man replied in a voice which he endeavoured to render indif- 
ferent, and in which there was a slight tremulousness. 

“Suppose you were relieved of her?” 

“Who? Cosette?” 

“Yes.” 

The red and violent face of the woman became illumined with a 
hideous expression. 

“Ah, monsieur ! my good monsieur! take her, keep her, take her 
away, carry her off, sugar her, stuff her, drink her, eat her, and be 
blessed by the holy Virgin and all the saints in Paradise !” 

“Agreed.” 

“Really ! you will take her away ?” 

“I will.” 

“Immediately ?” 

“Immediately. Call the child.” 

“Cosette !” cried the Thenardiess. 

“In the meantime,” continued the man, “I will pay my bill. How 
much is it?” ■ 

He cast a glance at the bill, and could not repress a movement of 
surprise. 

“Twenty-three francs?” 

He looked at the hostess and repeated : 

“Twenty-three francs?” 

There was, in the pronunciation of these two sentences, thus re- 
peated, the accent which lies between the point of exclamation and 
^he point of interrogation. 

The TMnardiess had had time to prepare herself for the shock, 
©he replied with assurance : 

’ “Y es, of course, monsieur ! it is twenty-three francs.” 

The stranger placed five five-franc pieces upon the table. ■, 

“Go for the little girl,” Said he. . ' ' 



354 L E S M X S f: R A U L K s 

At this moment Thcmrclier acivancctl intti the middle of the 
room and said : 

“Monsieur owes twenty-six sous." 

“Twenty-six sous !” exclaimed the woman. _ 

“Twenty sous for the room,” continued 'riu'nardier coldly, “and 
six for supper. As to the little girl, .1 inu.st have some talk with mon- 
sieur about that. Leave us, wife." 

The Thenardiess was dazzled by one of those une.\[tectetl ila.shes 
which emanate from talent. She felt that the great actor had en- 
tered upon the scene, aasvvereil not a word, and went tnit. 

As soon as they were alone, I'heiiardier offered the traveller a 
chair. The traveller .sat down, hnt Tlu'nardier remained standing, 
and his face assumed a singular expression of good-nature and sim- 
plicity. 

“Monsieur,” said he, “listen, 1 ntirst say that 1 adore this child." 

The .stranger looked at him s(e:uiily. 

“What child?" 

Thenardier continued: 

“How .strangely we hecome att.ached! W’h.at is ;»I1 this .silver? 
^ake hack your money. 'I’lns child ! adore." 

“Who is that?” asked tlie stranger. 

“Oh, our little Gwette! And you wish to take her :iway from us? 
Indeed, I speak frankly, as true as you are an honouialde man, 1 
cannot consent to it. I sliuuUl miss her. 1 have had her since .she was 
very small. It is true, .she costs us money ; it is true she has her 
faults, it i.s true we are not rich, it is true 1 paiii four humlretl francs 
for medicines at onetime when she was sick, lUit we must do .some- 
thing for God. She has neither father nor mother ; I have hroiight 
her up. I have bread enough for her and for myself, in f,icl, I 
must keep this child. You understand, we h:tve alfeetioiis; I am a 
gocxl lieast ; myself ; I do not rea.s«ii ; I Itive this little girl ; my wife 
is ha.sty, but .she loves her also, \’oti see, she is like, our own child. 
I feel the need of her prattle in the house," 

Tlie stranger was Uxtking steadily at liiiu .all the while, lie con- 
tinued : 

“Pardon me, excuse me,t«on.siuur, hut one thws nm give his eltild 
like that to a traveller. Isn’t h true that I .am riglil ? .After that, I 
don’t say— -you are rich and have tltc apjtearaiice of a very fine man

stand? On the supposition that ! should let her go .iiul s.it'rtlH'c nty

not want to lose sight of her, I should want to know who she was 
with, that I might come and .see her now .wd tlien, attd that she 
might know that her good jFoster-father was still watching over her. 
Finally, there are things which are not jMSsiWc, I do not know even

Uttle Lark, where has she gone ? I must, at least, see some poor rag 
of paper, a bit of a passport, something/’ ® 

The stranger, without removing from him this gaze which went 
so to speak, to the bottom of his conscience, answered in a severe 
and nrm tone. 

Monsieur Themrdier, people do not take a passport to come 
five. leagues from Pans. If I take Cosette, I talce her, that is aU 
You will not know my name, you will not know my abode you will 
not know where she goes, and my intention is that she shall never 
see you again in her life. Do you agree to that ? Yes or no ?” 

As denions and genii recognise by certain signs the presence of a 
superior God, Thenardier comprehended that he was to deal with 
one who was yery powerful. It came like an intuition; he under- 
Stood It with his dear and qitidc sagacity ; although during the even- 
ing he had been drinking with the waggoners, smoking, and singing 
bawdy songs, still he was observing the stranger all the while 
watching him like a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He 
had been observing him on his own account, for pleasure and by 
instinct, and at the same time lying in wait as if he had been paid 
for It. Not a ge.stiwe, not a movement of the man in the yellow coat 
■had escaped him. Before even the stranger had so clearly shown his 
interest in Cosette, Thcnardier had divined it. He had surprised the 
Stances of the old man constantly returning to the child. 
Why this interest ? What was this man ? Why, with so much money 
in his purse, this miserable dress ? These were questions which he 
put to himself without being able to answer them, and they irritated 
him. He had been thinking it oyer all night. This could not be 
Cosette s father. Was it a grandfather ? Then why did he not make 
himself known at once ? When a man has a right, he shows it. This 
man evidently had no right to Cosette. Then who was he? Thenar- 
dier was lost in conjectures. He caught glimpses of everything, but 
saw nothing. However it might be, when he commenced the conver- 
sation with this man, sure that there was a secret in all this, sure 
that the man had an interest in remaining unknown, he felt himself ' 
strong ; at the stranger's clear and firm answer, when he saw that 
this mysterious personage was mysterious and nothing more he felt 
weak. He was expecting nothing of the kind. His conjectures were 
put to flight. He rallied his ideas. He weighed all in a second. Th4- 
nardier was one of those men who comprehend a situation at « 
glance. He decided that this was the moment to advance straightfor- 
ward and swiftly. He did what great captains do at that decisive 
feistant which they alone can recognise; he unma^ed his tetteiy at 
.once, ■ . 

r “Monsieur,” said he, “I must have fifteen hunted francs.” 
i The stranger took from his side-pocket an old black leader 
|&gt;ocket-bo&lt;rfc, opened it, aftd drew forth three bank bills which* he

placed upon the table. Pie then rested his large tlunu!) mi these l)ills, 

and &gt;said to the tavern-keeper. 

“Bring Cosette/' 

While this was going on what was ( iKsetlt* ii«iing? 

Cosettc, as soon as she awdu*, liad nni tu licr \voM(lt*n shoe. She 
had found the gold pirn; in it, it was nr&lt;i v, XajHdenfu but one 
of those new twenty- fraitc pieces t)l the l\e.s!«trahofu mi the face of 
which the little Prussian ciueue had rt*plac(sl iht* laurel crown. Cos- 
ette was dazzled. Her destiny begaii to intoxicate lier. She did not 
know that it was a piece of gold; she had inner seen «ine before; 
she hastih" concealed it in her piK*ket as if she had sfcdrn it. Never- 
theless she felt it boded good to lier. Sht* diviie d whence the gift 
came, but she experienced a joy that was tilled widi awe. She was 
gratified; slie wasmore&lt;»ver stupeiieeb Such rnatptibceut and beauti- 
ful things seemed unreal to her, The tloll made her afraid, the gold 
piece made her afraid. Slie Iremlded witli wonder lnd\?ir tliese mag- 
niiicences. The stranger himself did nut make !ier afraiti. On the 
tontrary, he reassured her. Since the prtu'huis^ evening, amid all 
her astonishment, and in her sleep, she was thitiking in her little 
child’s mind of this man who had such an old, ami jioor. and sad 
ajipearance, and who wa.s so riclt atal so kintl. Since .she had met 
this gcuKlman in the w«hh1, it seemed as thtmgh all things were 
changed about her. C’usette, less happy than the lunalleta swallow 
of the sky, had never known what it is ti&gt; take refug, e under a fnoth- 
er’s wing. For live years, that is to say. as far Icick as she emild re- 
member, the poor child liad shivered and shuddered. She had al- 
ways been naked under tlm Idling north wind of misfortune, and 
now it Si‘emed to her that she was dotlu*d. Hefme her sou! was 
cold, now it was warm, Cosefte was no longer afraid ni the Thenar- 
diers; she was no longer alone; she had somehody to look to. 

Site hurriedly set herself to her imniiing task/Tliis louis. which 
she had placed in the same pocket of her apron from which the fif- 
teen-sous {dece ha&lt;l fallen the night before, distracted tier attention 
from her work. Site did iitd dare to touch it, but nIic sjamt live min-

bundle contained a little woolen frock, an apron, a coarse cotton 
under-garment, a petticoat, a scarf, woollen stockings, and shoes- ■ 
a complete dress for a girl of seven years. It was all in black. 

“My child,” said the man, “take this and go and dress yourself 
quick.” 

The day was breaking when those of the inhabitants of Mont- 
fermeil who were beginning to open their doors, saw pass on the 
road to Paris a poorly clad goodman leading a little girl dressed in 
mourning who had a pink doll in her arms. They were going to- 
wards Livry. 

It was the stranger and Cosette. 

No one recognised the man ; as Cosette was not now in tatters, 
few recognised her. * 

Cosette was going away. With whom ? She was ignorant. Where f 
She knew not. All she understood was, that .she was leaving behind 
the Thenardier chop-house. Nobody had thought of bidding her 
good-by, nor liad she of bidding good-by to anybody. She went out 
from that house, hated and hating. 

Poor gentle being, whose heart had only been crushed hitherto. 

Cosette walked seriou.sly along, opening her large eyes, and look . 
ing at the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. 
From time to time she bent over and cast a glance at it, and then 
looked at the goodman. She. felt somewhat as if she were near God.

WHO SEEKS THE BEST MAY FIND THE WORST 

The Thenardie.ss, according to her custom, had left her hu.sband 
alone. She was e.Kpccting great events. When the man and Cosette 
were gone, Thenardier, after a good quarter of an hour, took het; 
aside, and .showed her the fifteen hundred francs. 

“What’s that?” said she. 

It was the first time, since the beginning of their housekeeping, 
that she had dared to criticise the act of her master. 

He felt the blow. 

“True, you are right,” said he ; 'T am a fool. Give me my hat,” 

He folded the three bank bills, thrust them into his pocket, and 
started in all haste, but he missed the direction and took the toad to 
the right. Some neighbours of whom he inquired put Hin on the 
track; the Lark and the man had been seen to go in the direction of 
Livry. He followed this indication, walking rapidly and talking to 
himself. 

"This man is evidently a millionaire dressed inydlow, and as for 
me,, I am a brute, He first gave Wepi^ then five francs, then 



358 LES MlSiRABLES 

fifty francs, then fifteen hundred francs, al! so readily, ITe would 

have given fifteen thousand francs. Hut 1 shall catch him.” 

And then this bundle of clothes, made ready beforeiifUKl for the 
little girl; all that was strange, there wa.s a good deal &lt;if mystery 
under it. When one gets hold of a mystery, he iloes imt let go of it. 
The secrets of the rich are sponges full of gold ; a man ought to 
know howto squeeze them. All these thoughts were whirling in his 
bi’ain. “I am a brute,” said he. 

On leaving Montfermeil and reaching the turn made by the road 
to Livry, the route mat’ be seen for a long dislaure on tlie plateau. 
On reaching this point he counted on being able to .see the man and 
the little girl. He looked as far as hi.s eyecouhj reach, Imt saw noth- 
ing. He inquired again. In the nieutiwhiie he was losing titne. 'I'he 
passer.s-by told him that the man and child whom he .sought had 
travelled towards the wood in the direction of Oagny. He htistened 
in this direction. 

They had the .start of him, hut a child walks sUiwly, ;tud he went 
vapidly. And then the country w.a.s well kntnvn to him. 

Sucidcnly he stopped anti struck his forehead iilvc a man who has 
forgotten the main thing, and who thinks of reiracing his steps. 

‘‘I ought to have tjiken my gun !” said lie. 

Tlienardier was one of tiui.se double natures who sometimes ap- 
pear amoug us without our kiKiwledge, and disappear without ever 
being known, because destiny has slunvii us but (&lt;ne side of them. 
It i.s the fau; of many men to live thus half sithnierged. In ji quiet 
ordinary sitiuiion, 'Hienartlier liat! all that is necess.ity to make— ■ 
we do not .stiy to he — wluit passes for an honest tradesinaii, a good 
citizen. At the same time, under certain circiimstarn'es. niuler the 
operation of certain occurreiifes exciting his baser nature, lie had 
in hiin all that was necesstiry to la* a villain, f le was ji siuijikeeper, 
in which lay hidden a monster, .Satan ought for a innment ti liavc 
.squatted in some corner tif the hole in which Tltcnardier lived and 
studied this liiditous tiiaslerpiecc. 

After hesitating an iii.stiinl : 

'Tlah!” thought he, “they waukl have time to escape !'* 

And he continued on his way, going rapidly forwani, and almost 
as if he were certain, with the sagacity of ilte fox acctiting a flock 
of [lartridges. 

In fiict, when he hat! tiaased t!»c ponds, and ertmsed tililiquely the 
large mc.adow at the right of the avenue de Bellevue, as he reached 
the gnts.sy path wliieh nearly cncircha the hill, and which covers 
the arch of the old aqueduct of the abbey of Cltelleit, be perceived 
above a bush, the hat on which lie !«td already built so many conjec- 
tures. It was the man's liat. The bushes were low. Theiiardier 
ecived that the nutn and Cosettc were smited there. The child could 
not be seen, she was so short, but he ccatlil see the head of the doH. 



C p S E T T E 359 

Th&amp;ardier was not deceived. The man had sat down there to 
give Cosette a little rest. The chop-house keeper turned aside the 
bushes, and suddenly appeared before the eyes of those whom hfe 
sought. 

“Pardon me, excuse me, monsieur,” said he, all out of breath; 
“but here are your fifteen hundred francs.” 

So saying, he held out the three bank bills to the stranger.- 

The man raised his eyes : 

“What does that mean?” 

Th^nardier answered respectfully : 

“Monsieur, that means that I take back Cosette.” 

Cosette shuddered, and hugged close to the goodman. 

He answered, looking Thenardier straight in the eye, and spac- 
ing his syllables. 

^‘You — ^take — ^back — Cosette?” 

“Yes, monsieur, I take her back. I tell you I have reflected. In- 
deed, I haven’t the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you 
see. This little girl is not mine. She belongs to her mother. Her 
mother has confided her to me ; I can only give her up to her mother. 
You will tell me : But her mother is dead. Well. In that case, I can 
only give up the child +0 a person who shall bring me a written or- 
der, signed by the mother, stating I should deliver the child to him, 
That is clear.” . 

The man, without answering, felt in his pocket, and Th6nardiei’ 
saw the pocket-booK containing the bank bills reappear. 

The tavern-keeper felt a thrill of joy. 

“Good !” thought he ; “hold on. He is going to corrupt mel” 

Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a look about 
him. The place was entirely deserted. There was not a soul either 
in the wood, or in the valley. The man opened the pocket-book, and 
drew from if, not the handful of bankbills which Thdnardier ex- 
p^ted, but a little piece of paper, which he unfolded and presented 
o^en to the innkeeper, saying : 

“You are right. Read that I” 

Thenardier took the paper and read. 

«M surM March 25, 1823. 

“Monsieur Thenardier: 

^Tou will deliver Cosette to the bearer. He will settle all small 
debts. 

“I have the honour to salute you with consideration. 

“Fantine." 

“You know that signature?” fepliedtbcman. 

It was indeed the signature of Fantme.T^Hwdier recognised it, 



360 LES MISfeRAIlI^ES 

There was nothing to say. He felt doubly enrage&lt;l, enraged at be. 
ing compelled to give up the l)ril&gt;c which he hoped for, and enraged 
at being beaten. The man added : 

“You can keep this paper as your receipt." 

Thenardier retreated in good order. 

“This signature is very well imitated," he grumbled between his 
teeth. “Weil, so be it!" 

Then he made a &lt;lesperalc elTort. 

“Monsieur," .said he, "it is all right. Then you are the person. 
But you must settle ‘all .small &lt;lcbts.’ There is a large amount due to 
me. 

The man ro.se to his feet, ajul .said at the same tune, snapping 
with his thumi) and linger .some dust from his threadhare .sleeve; 

“Monsieur Thenardier, in January the mother reekoneil that she 
owed you a hundred and twenty fntnes ; you sent her in h'ehrnary 
a memorandum i&gt;f live htindretl fnincs; you received three hundred 
francs at tlie end of ludiruary, and three hundred at the beginning 
of March. There ha.s since elapse&lt;! nine numtlts which, at fifteen

thirty-live francs. \'ou h;id received .a hmidreel francs in atlvancc. 
There remain thirty-live francs due you, I have just given you fif- 
teen hundrcil francs." 

'I'henanlicr felt what the wolf feels the iitomenl when he finds 
himself .seized and criishetl by the steel jaws of the trap. 

“What is this devil of a nuiii?” thought he. 

He did what the wolf d«»es, he gave a spring. Audacity hat! sue*

one a bitter mockery, the piece of paper signed Fantine, and the 
other a consolation, the fifteen hundred francs. 

The man was leading L'osette in the direction of Livry and 
Bondy. He was walking slowly, his hea&lt;I bent down, in an attitude 
of reflection and satlncss. The winter htui bereft the wood of foli- 
age, so that Thenardicr did not lose sight of them, though remain- 
ing at a considerable distance behind. l*'roni time to time the man 
turned, and looked to .see if he were followed. Suddenly he per- 
ceived Thenardicr. He at once entered a copjnee with Cosettc, and 
both disappeared from sight. “The devil !” saitl Thenardicr. And he 
redoubled his pace. 

The density of the thicket compelled him to approach them. 
Wlicn the man reaeliecl tlie thickest part of the woo&lt;l, he turned 
again. Thenardicr had endenvburtHl to cotieeal hims&lt;;lf in the branch-

cast an uneasy glance at him, then shook his head, and resumed his 
journey. The innkeeper again took up the imrsuit. 'I'hey walked 
j thus two or thrce_ hundred paces. Su&lt;l&lt;lenly the man turned again. 
He perceived the innkeeper. 'I'lns time he looked at him so forbid-

Jean Vaejk.^n was not dead. 

When he fell into the sea, or rather when he threw himself into 
it, he was, as we Iiave .seen, free from his irons. He swam under 
water to a ship at anchor to which a boat was fastened. 

He fotiiKl means to conceal him.self in this boat until evening. 
At night he hiitook himself again to the water, ami reached the lana 
a short distance from Csipe Ilrnn. • 

There, as he di&lt;l not lack for money, he could pnwure clothes. A 
little puhlic-hoHsc in the environs of Italaguier was then the place 
which supplied clothing for escajwd convicts, a lucrative business. 
Then Jean Valjean, like all those joyless fugitives who are endeav- 
ouring to throw off the track the spy of the law and social fatality, 
followet! an obscure and wandering i«ith. He found an asylum first 
in Pradeaux, near Keausset. Then he went towards Grand Villard, 
near Brianqon, in the Hautes Aljics. Groping and restless flight, 
threading the maaes of the mole whose windings are unknown. There 
were afterwards found some trace of his passage in Atn, on the 
territory of Civrieux, in the Pyrenees at Accons, at a pl»:e called 
the Grange-de-Domecq, near the hamlet of Chavailles, and in the 
environs of Pirigneux, at Brunies, a canton of Chapelle Gonaguet^ 
He finally reachra Paris. We have seen him at Montfermeil, 



362 L E S M I S £ R A B L E S 

His first care, on reaching Paris, had iiccn to inirfhast' a mourning 
dress for a little girl of seven years, then to i)rt,K'nre hxlgings. That 
done, he had gone to Montfcnneil. 

It will be remembered that, at the time of his former escape, or 
near that time, he had made a mysterious journey of whicli justice 
had had some glimpse. , , . 

Moreover, he was believed to he tlead, aitd tl:at thickened the 
obscurity which surrounded him. At Paris there fell into his hands 
a paper which chronicled the fact, lie felt reassured, ami almost 
as much at peace as if he really h;id been dend._ 

On the evening of the .same day that Jean \‘aljean had re.scued 
Cosette from the clutches of the Thenardiess. he (’iitered Paris 
again. He entered the city at night-fall, with the eltild, by the har- 
riere de Monce:ui.K. There lie tonk a cahriiilet, which carried lumas 
far as the esplanade of thcOliservatorv. 'I'liere he got out. paid the 
driver, took Co.selte by the. hauft, and lioth in the darkness of the 
night, through the deserted streets in the vicinity of I'l tureinc and 
la Glacierc, walked towards the liouh'vard de i'liopital. 

The day had been strange and full of emotion for Cosette; they 
had eaten behind hedges bread and chee-a* lioiiglu at isolated chop- 
houses; they had often changed carriaijes. and hat] travelled .sliort 
distances on foot. .She did not complain : but she was tiretl, and jean 
Valjean perceived it by her pulling more heavily at hi.s Itand while 
walking. He ti.&gt;ok her in his arms; t'ttsi'iie, without letting go of 
Catharine, laid her head on Jean V'alje.an's shoulder, and went to 
sleep. 



BOOK FOURTH— THE OLD GORBEAU HOUSE 

I 

MASTER GORBEAU 

Forty years ago, the solitary pedestrian who ventured into the un- 
known regions of La Salpctriere and went up along the Boulevard 
as far as the Barriere’ dTtalie, reached certain points where it might 
he said that Paris disappeared. It was no longer a solitude, for there 
were people passing ; it was not the country, for there were houses 
and streets ; it was not a city, the streets had ruts in them, like the 
highways, and grass grew along their borders ,• it was not a village, 
the houses were too lofty. What was it then? It was an inhabited 
place where there was nobody, it was a desert place where there was 
somebody ; it was a boulevard of the great city, a street of Paris, 
wilder, at night, than a forest, and gloomier, by day, than a grave- 
yard. 

It was the old quarter of the Horse Market. 

Our pedestrian, if he trusted himself beyond the four tumbling 
walls of this Horse Market, if willing to go even further than the 
Rue du Petit Banquier, leaving on his right a court3rard shut in by 
lofty walls, then a meadow studded with stacks of tanbark tliat 
looked like the gigantic beaver dams, then an inclosure half filled 
with lumber and piles of logs, sawdust and shavings, from the top 
of which a huge dog was hayr^, then a long, low, ruined wall with 
a small dark-coloured and decrepit gate in it, covered with moss, 
which was full of flowers in spring-time, then, in the loneliest spot, 
a frightful broken-down structure on which could be read in large 
letters : POST NO BILLS ; this hold promenader, we say, would 
reach the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel, a latitude not 
much explored. There, near a manufactory and between two garden 
walls, could be seen at the time of which we speak an old ruined 
dwelling that, at first sight, seemed as small as a cottage, yet was, 
in reality, as vast as a cathedral. It .stood with its gable end towards 
the highway, and hence its apparent diminutiveness. Nearly the 
whole house was hidden. Only the door and one window could be 
seen. ■ 

This old dwelling had but one story. 

On examining it, the peculiarity that first struck the beholder WM 

that the door could never have been, anyth®® hut the door of a hovet 
while the window, had it been cat in freestone twd sot in. rough 
iaaterial, might have been dte of » l©r&lt;% residence.

'Steps covered with mud, plaster, and dust, and nf the same hre:idth

ularly like a ladder, and disappear in the shadow heiween two walls.

the ground, which was filled with stones that passing urchins had 
thrown into it. _ 

A portion of this building has recently been pulled down, but 
what remains, at the present day, still conveys an idea of what it 
was. The structure, taken as a whole, is not more than a hundred 
years old. A hundred years is youth to a church, but old age to a 
private mansion. It would seem that the dwelling of Man partakes 
of his brief existence, and the dwelling of God, of His eternity. 

The letter-carriers called the house jNo. 50-52 ; but it was known, 
in the quarter, as Gorbeau House. 

Let us see how it came by that title. 

The “gatherers-up of unconsidered trifles” who collect anecdotes 
as the herbalist his simples, and prick the fleeting dates upon their 
memories with a pin, know that there lived in Paris, in the last 
century, about 1770, two attorneys of the Chatelet, one named 
Corbeau and the other Renard — ^two names, anticipated by La 
Fontaine. The chance for a joke was altogether too fine a one to be 
let slip by the goodly company of lawyers' clerks. So, very soon, 
the galleries of the court-rooms rang with the following parody, in 
rather gouty verse : 

Maitre Corbeau, sur un do-ssier perche, 

Teiiait dans son bee une saisie cxccutoire; 

Maitre Renard, par I’odeur all6chi, 

Lui fit i pen pres cette histoire: 

He! bonjour! etc.* 

The two honest practitioners, annoyed by these shafts of wit, and 
rather di.sconcerted in their dignity by the roars of laughter that 
followed them, re.solved to change their names, and, with that view, 
applied to the king. The petition was pre.sentcd to Louis XV. on 
the very day on which the Pope’s Nuncio and the Cardinal de La 
Roche- Aymon in the pre.sence of his Majesty, devoutly kneeling, 
one on each .side of Madame Du Barry, put her slippers on her 
naked feet, as she was getting out of bed. The king, who was laugh- 
ing, continued his laugh ; he passed gaily from the two bishops to 
the two advocates, and absolved these limbs of the law from their 
names almost. It was granted to Master Corbeau, by the fcing's- 
good pleasure, to add a flourish to the first letter of his name, thus 
making it Gorbeap; Master Renard was less fortunate, as he only 
got permission to put a P. before the R. which made the word 
Prenard,* a name no less appropriate than the first one. 

’Master Crow, on a document perched.

Now, according to tradition, this Master (iorhean was the pro- 
prietor of the structure mnnhcrcMl 50*5d, i&gt;uulrvard dv 11 lujutahHe

and the gloomy sameness of right angles. Not a variation of the sur- 
face of the ground, not a caprice of architecture, not a curve. Alto- 
gether, it was chilly, regular, and hideous. Nothing stifles one like 
this perpetual symmetry. Symmetry is ennui, and ennui is the very 
essence of grief and melancholy. Despair yawns. Something more 
terrible than a hell of suffering may be conceived ; to wit, a hell of 
ennui. Were there such a hell in existence, this .section of the Boule- 
vard de I’Hopital might well serve as the approach to it. 

Then, at nightfall, at the moment when the day is dying out, 
especially in winter, at that hour when the evening breeze' tears 
from the elms their faded and withered leaves?, when the gloom is 
deep, without a .single star, or when the moon and the wind make 
opening.s in the clouds, thi.s boulevard became positively terrifying. 
The dark outlines .shrank together, and even la.st themselves in the 
obscurity like fragments of the infinite. The pas.scr-by could not 
keep from thinking of the innumerable bloody traditions of the 
spot, 'J'he solitude of this neighliourhood in which .so many crimes 
had been committed, had something fearful about it. One felt pre- 
sentiments of snarc.s in thi.s obscurity ; all the confused outlines 
visible through the gloom were eyed suspiciou.sly, and the oblong 
cavities between the trees seemed like graves. In the day-time it was 
ugly ; in the evening, it ■was tiismal ; at night, it was ominous of 
evil. In summer, in tlie twilight, some old woman might be seen 
seated, here and there, under the elms, on benches made mouldy by 
the rain. These good okl dames were addicted to begging. 

In conclusion, this quarter, which was rather sujierannuated than 
ancient, from tiiat time began to undergo a transformation. Thence- 
forth, whoever would see it, must hasten. Each day, some of its de- 
tails wholly passed away. Now, as has Iteen the case for twenty 
years past, the terminus of the Orleans railroad lies Just outside of 
the old suburb, a Jid keeps it in movement. Wherever you may locate, 
in the outskirts of a capital, a railroad depot, it is the death of a 
suburb and the birth of a city. It would seem as though around 
these great centres of the activit;y of nations, at the rumbling of 
these mighty engines, at the snorting of these giant draught-horses 
of civilisation, which devour coal and spout forth fire, the earth, 
teeming with germs of life, trembles and opens to swallow old 
dwellings of men and to bring forth new; old houses crumble, mw 
houses spring up. 

Since the de^t of the Orleans railway invaded the grounds of 
La Salp&amp;riire, the old narrow streets that adjoin the Foss^ Saint 
Victor and the Jardin des Pkntes are givic^ way, violently tra- 
versed, as they are, three or four tirnw a day, by those streams of 
difigences, hades, and omnibuses, ’whidh, in courae of time, push

the December sun struggled through the garret window and traced 
upon the ceiling long streaks of light and shade. Suddenly a car- 
rier’s waggon, heavily laden, trundled over the cobble-stones of 
the boulevard, and shook the old building like the rumbling of a 
tempest, jarring it from cellar to roof-tree. 

“Yes, madame !” cried Cosette, starting up out of sleep, “here I 
am ! here I am !’’ 

And she threw herself from the bed, her eyelids still half closed 
with the weight of slumber, stretching out her liand towards the 
corner of the wall. 

“Oh ! what .shall I do ? Where is my broom ?” said she. 

By this time her eyes were fully open, and she saw the smiling 
face of Jean Valjean. 

“Oh ! yes — so it is !” said the child. “Good morning, monsieur.” 

Children at once accept joy and happiness with quick familiarity, 
being themselves naturally all happine.ss and joy. 

Cosette noticed Catharine at the foot of the bed, laid hold 6f her 
at once, and, playing the while, asked Jean Valjean a thousand 
questions. — Where was she? Was Paris a big place? Was Madame 
Thcnardier really very far away ? Wouldn’t she come back again, etc., 
etc. All at once she exclaimed, “How pretty it is here !” 

It was a frightful hovel, but she felt free. 

“Must I sweep ?” she continued at length. 

“Play !” replied Jean Valjean. 

And thus the day passed by. Cosette, without troubling herself 
with trying to understand anything about it, was inexpressibly 
happy with her doll and her good friend. 


ni 

TWO MISFORTUNES MINGLED MAKE KAPPINESS 

The dawn of the next day found Jean Valjean again near the bed 
of Cosette. He waited there, motionless, to see her wake. 

Something new was entering his soul. 

Jean Valjean had never loved anything. For twenty-five years 
he had been alone in the world. He had never been a father, lover, 
husband, or friend. At the galleys, he was cross, sullen, abstinent, 
ignorant, and intractable. The heart of the old convict was full of 
freshness. His sister and her children had left in his memory only 
a vague and distant impression, which had finally almost entirely 
vanished. He had made every exertion to find them again, and, not 
succeeding, had forgotten them. Human nature is thus constituted. 
The other tender emotions of his youth, if any such he had, were 
lost in an abyss. 

When he saw Cosette, when he had taken her, carried her away. 



370 L E S M I S £ R A B L E S 

and rescued her, he felt his heart muvcd. All that he had of feeling 
and affection" was aroused and vehemently attracted towards this 
child. He would approach the betl where she sleiil, and would 
tremble there with delight ; he felt inward yearnings, like a mother 
and knew not what they were; for it is something very incoinpre- 
hensibleand very sweet, this grami and strange emotion of a heart 
in its first love. 

Poor old heart, so young ! 

But, as he was fifty-live and Cosette was lint eight years old, all 
that he might have felt of love in his entire life melted into a sort 
of ineffable radiance. 

This was the second white vision he Itad seen. ‘I'he liishup had 
caused the dawn of virtue on his horizon ; i osetie evokn! the dawn 
of love. 

The first few days rolled hy amid litis liewildertnent. 

On her iiarl, (‘osette, too, uaeonst'Kiii.ly utidei went a elmnge 
poor'little creature! fshe was so small wlieii her mother left her' 
that she could not rccolleet her now. .A.s .all eluldia-n do, like the

aught to do wiih her. .Monnifiil thing to tell, tmdom. whii h we Imve

her fault; it was not the faetihy of love that die kuSo-d ; alas! it was 
the ixissihility. And so, from the verv iii d dav, all that thought amt 
felt in her began to love this kind olil friend. She now frirsensa- 
tions utterly unknown to her hefore-a M-nsilion of Imdding and 
of growth. **

n hen their two .souls s;iw each other, they rrcogni.scd iliat they were 
mutually needed, and they closely embraced. 



C O S E T T K 371 

Taking the words in their most comprehensive and most absolute 
sense, it might be said that, separated from everything by the walls 
of the tomb, Jean Valjean was the husband bereaved, as Cosette was 
the orphan. This position made Jean Valjean become, in a celestial 
sense, the father of Cosette. 

And, in truth, the mysterious impression produced upon Cosette, 
in the depths of the woods at Chelles, by the hand of Jean Valjean 
grasping her own in the darkness, was not an illusion but a redity. 
The coming of this man and his participation in the destiny of this 
child had been the advent of God. 

In the meanwhile, Jean Valjean had well chosen his hiding- 
place. He was there in a state of security that seemed to be com- 
plete. 

The apartment with the side chamber which he occupied with 
Cosette, was the one whose window looked out upon the boulevard. 
This window being the only one in the house, there was no neigh- 
bour’s prying eye to fear either from that side or opposite. 

The lower floor of No. 50-52 was a sort of dilapidated shed; it 
served as a sort of stable for market gardeners, and had no com- 
munication with the upper floor. It was separated from it by the 
flooring, which had neither stairway nor trap-door, and was, as it 
were, the diaphragm of the old building. The upper floor contained, 
as we have said, several rooms and a few lofts, only one of which 
was occupied — by an old woman, who was maid of all work to Jean 
Valjean. All the rest was uninliabited. 

It was this old woman, honoured with the title of landlady, but; 
in -reality, intrusted with the functions of portress, who had rented 
him these lodgings on Christmas Day. He had passed himself off 
to her as a gentleman of means, ruined by the Spanish Bonds, who 
was going to live there with his grand-daughter. He had paid her, 
for six months in advance, and engaged the old dame to furnish the 
chamber and the little bedroom, as we have described them. This 
old woman it was who had kindled the fire in the stove and made 
everything ready for them, on the evening of their arrival. 

Weeks rolled by. These two beings led in that wretched shelter 
a happy life. 

i(&gt; From the earliest dawn, Cosette laughed, prattled, and sang. 
'Children have their morning song, like birds. 

Sometimes it happened that Jean Valjeal would take her little 
red hand, all chapped and frost-bitten as it was, and kiss it. The 
poor child, accustomed only to blows, had no idea what tins meant, 
and would draw back ashamed. _ .,.11 

At times, she grew serious and looked musingly at her little black 
^ress. Cosette was no longer in rags ; she was in mourning. She was 
'Issuing from utter poverty and was entering upon life._ 

Jean Valjean had begun to teach her to read. Sometimes, wbuf

intention of accomplishing evil tliat lie had h'anuMl to reatl, iii the 
galleys. This intention had now Ih.hmi ehanged iiHn irav lnuL; a child 
to road. Then the old convict would sniiie with tlie pensive smile 
of angels. 

He felt in this a pre-ordination tnan ttn hii;!!, a volition of some 
one more than man, and he would lo&gt;c hiuiM*lf in reverie. Hood 
thoughts as well as hml have their rdiy.sscs. 

To teach Cosette to read, anti to watch her i-layine;, was nearly 
all Jean Valjean’s life. And tiu*n, he would talk to Iter about her 
motlier, and teach her to i.&gt;ray. 

She called him 7a////.T, ami knew him by m« iMlier nanue

COSETTE 


373 


IV 

WHAT THE LANDLADY DISCOVERED 

Jean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out in the daytime 
Every evening, however, about twilight, he would walk for an hour 
or two, sometimes alone, often with Cosette, selecting the most un- 
frequented side alleys of the boulevards and going into the churches 
at nightfall. He was fond of going to St. Medard, which is the 
nearest church. When he did not take Cosette, she remained with the 
old woman ; but it was the child’s delight to go out with her kind old 
friend. She preferred an hour with him even to her delicious teu 
a-tctes with Catharine. He would walk along holding her by the 
hand, and telling her pleasant things. ^ 

It turned out that Cosette was very playful. 

The old woman was housekeeper and cook, and did the 
marketing. 

They lived frugally, always with a little fire in the stove, but 
hke people m embarrassed- circumstances. Jean Valjean made no 
change m the furniture described on the first day, excepting that 
he caused a solid door to be put up in place of the glass door of 
^ Cosette’s little bed-chamber. 

He still wore his yellow coat, his black pantaloons, and his old 
hat. On the street he was taken for a beggar. It sometimes hap- 
pened that kind-hearted dames, in passing, would turn and hand 
him a penny. Jean Valjean accepted the penny and bowed humbly. 
It chanced, sometimes, also, that he would meet some wretched 
creature begging alms, and then, glancing about him to be sure no 
one was looking, he would stealthily approach the beggar, slip a 
piece of money, often silver, into his hand, and walk rapidly away. 
This had its inconveniences. He began to be known in the quarter 
as the beggar who gives alms. 

The old landlady, a crabbed creature, fully possessed with that 
keen observation as to all that concerned her neighbburs, which is 
peculiar to the suburbs, watched Jean Valjean closely witout excit- 
ing his suspicion. She was a little deaf, which made her talkative. 
She had but two teeth left, one in the upper and one in the lower 
jaw, and these she was continually rattling together. She had ques- 
tioned Cosette, who, knowing nothing, could tell nothing, further 
than that she came from Montfermeil. One morning this old female 
spy saw Jean Valjean go, with an appearance which seemed pecu- 
liar to the old busybody, into one of the uninhabited apartments of 
the building. She followed him with the steps of m old cat, and 
OTuld see him without herself being seen, through the chink of the 
door directly opposite. Jean Valjean haul, doubtless for greater 
caution, turned his back towards the door in question. The old 



374 L E S M I S ft R A R I. K S 

woman saw him fumble in his pocket, and take from it a needle 
case, scissors, and thread, and then proceed to rip open the lining 
of one lapel of his coat and take from under it a piece _of yellow- 
ish paper, which he unfolded. 'I'lic beldame remarked with &lt;lismay, 
that it was a bank bill for a thousand francs. It was the second or 
third one only that she had ever seen. Site ran away very tnuch 
frightened. 

A moment afterwards, Jean 'V’aljean accosted her. and asked her

the half-yearly interest on his property which he had r«veived on 
the previous day. “Where?” thought the old wmnan. lie did not go 
out until si.K o’clock, and the gtiverninent treasury is eertahtly not 
open at that hour. The old womtin got the note cliatiged, all tlte 
while forming her conjectures. 'I'his bill of a thousand frtmes, 
commented upon and multiplied, gave rise to ;i host of bre;ithkss 
conferences among the gossips tif the Kite desX'igiies Saint .M,arcel. 

Some days afterwards, it chanced tlwi Jetii; \'aljean, in his sbirt- 
sleeve.s, was sawing wood in the entry. 'Idle *»ld woman was in his 
room doing the cliamberwork. .Site was alone, {‘osette w.as intent

Every pocket of this emt liad the tippearence of CMtii.aining some-

Thus, the occui»antsof the old building reached the tdosnigdays

A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FAt.I.t.N’f, ON Till* M AKES A NOISE 

Tiiekk was, in the neighbmirliood of Saint Mcdard, a mendicant 
who sat crouching over the etlge of a l oitdemned puidie well near 
by, and to whom Jpn Vaijisni often gave iilms. He never jsissed 
thi,s nuin without giving him a few jieiiiiies, .Somettines he sjioke 
to him. Those who were envious of this jHiur creiUiire *.itid he was in 
the pay of the police, ife was an old church beadle uf seventy-five, 
who was always tnumhiing prayers. 

One evening, a.s Jean V'aljcan was {lassing iliat way, unactRiin- 
panied by C'o.sette, he noticed the Iwggar silling in his usual place, 
under the street lamp which had just liecn lighted. The man, ac- 



COSETTB 37S 

cording to custom, seemed to be praying and was bent over. Jean 
Valjean walked up to him, and put a piece of money in his hand, 
as usual. The beggar suddenly raised his eyes, gazed inteijtly at 
Jean Valjean, and then quickly dropped his head. This movement 
was like a flash; Jean Valjean shuddered; it seemed to him that 
he had just seen, by the light of the street-lamp, not the calm, sanc- 
timonious face of the aged beadle, but a terrible and well-known 
countenance. He experienced the sensation one would feel on find- 
ing himself suddenly face to face, in the gloom, with a tiger. He 
recoiled, horror-stricken and petrified, daring neither to breathe 
nor to speak, to stay nor to fly, but gazing upon the beggar who had 
once more bent down his head, with _ its tattered covering, and 
seemed to be no longer conscious of his presence. At this singular 
moment, an instinct, perhaps the mysterious instinct of self-preser- 
vation, prevented Jean Valjean from uttering a word. The beggar 
had the same form, the same rags, the same general appearance as 
on every other day. “Pshaw !’’ said Jean Valjean to himself, “I am 
mad ! I am dreaming ! It cannot be !” And he went home, anxious 
and ill at ease. 

He scarcely dared to admit, even to himself, that the coun^ 
tenance he thought he had seen was the face of Javert. 

_ That night, upon reflection, he regretted tlra.t he had not ques- 
tioned the man so as to compel him to raise his head a second time. 
On the morrow, at nightfall, he went thither, again. The beggar 
was in his place. “Good day! Good day!” said Jean Valjean, with 
firmness, as he gave him the accustomed alms. The beggar raised 
his head and answered in a whining voice: “Thanks, kind sit, 
thanks !” It was, indeed, only the old beadle. 

Jean Valjean now felt fully reassured. He even began to laugh. 
“V/hat the deuce was I about to fancy that I saw Javert,” thought 
he; “is my sight growing poor already?” And he thought no more 
about it. 

Some days after, it might be eight o’clock in the evening, he was 
in his room, giving Cosette her spelling lesson, which the child was 
repeating in a loud voice, when he heard the door of the building 
qpen and close again. That seemed odd to him. The old woman, the 
only occupant of the house besides himself and Cosette, always 
went to bed at dark to save candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to 
Cosette to be silent. He heard some one coming up the stairs. Pos- 
sibly, it might be the old woman who had felt unwell and had been 
to the druggist’s. Jean Valjean listened. The footstep was heavy, 
and sounded like a man’s ; but the old woman wore heavy shoes, and 
there is nothing so much like the step of a man as the step of an 
aid woman. However, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.^ 
j.,! He sent Cosette to bed, telling her in a suppressed voice to li#

Stopped. Jean Valjean remained silent and motionless, his 
turned towards the door, still sealed i)n his cliair from which he 
had not moved, and holding his hreatli in the darktiess. After a 
considerable interval, not hearing aiiything !nort‘, Ih‘ turned round 
without making any noise, aiul as he raised his eyes towards the 
door of his room, he .saw a light tlirotigh the kevlude, 11iis niy of 
light was an evil star in the black ]);u’kgi’«mnd of tlie dinw aiufthe 
wall There was, evidently, soineI&gt;t&gt;dy i&gt;utsif!c with a caudle who 
was listening.

no sound of footsteps, which seeinet! ti&gt; indicate that wlKK*ver was

Jean Valjean threw himself on liis lunl without undressing, big 
could not shut his eyes that night. 

At daybreak, as he was sinking intr&gt; s!umlH*r from fatigue, be

the end of the hall, and then he heanl tiic same footstep which had 
ascended the stairs, on the preceding night. The step apinuached. 
He startt^l from his be&lt;l and placet I his eye to tin* keyhole, which 
was c|uitc a large one, lin|)ing to get a glimp se tif the |u'rson, whti-

night-time and had listened at Ins di*or. it was a man, indeed, who 
passed hy Jean Yaljean's nuan, thi.N time withcatl stop|nng, The hall 
wa.s still too tiark for him to make can his iratnres ; hnt, when the 
man reached the stairs, a ray of light from withmn inmle his %nre 
stand out like a profile, and Jean Valjean !iad a full vii»w of his 
back. The man was tall wore a long fiock ‘4;» »;u, attd had a cudgel

to raise the sash, and that he dari^d not do. 

It was evident tliat the man had entered by mean , of a key, as

“Well, I hardly recollect now. Dumont or Daumont. — Some

“And what is he — ^this M. Daumont ?” 

The old woman studied him, a moment, through her little fo.xy 
eyes, and answered : 

“He’s a gentleman living on his income like you.” 

She may have intended nothing by this, but Jean Valjean thought 
he could make out that .she did. 

When the old woman was gone, he made a roll of a hundred 
francs he had in a drawer and put it into his pocket. Do what he 
would to manage this so that the clinking of the silver should not 
be heard, a five-franc piece escaped his grasp and rolled jingling 
away over the floor. 

At dusk, he went to the street-door and looked carefully up and 
down the boulevard. No one was to be seen. The boulevard seemed 
to be utterly deserted. It is true tliat there might have been some 
one hidden behind a tree. 

He went upstairs again, 

“Come,” said he to Cosettc. 

He took her by the hand and they both went out

In order to understand the pafjes imineiliately following, and 
others also which will he found further on, an ohservation is here 
necessary. 

Many years have already passed away sinee the author nf this 
book, who is conipelksl, rehuHantly, tt» sjiettk of hinistlf, was in 
Paris, Since then. Paris has been transformed. A new city has 
arisen, which to him i.s in .sonic sense uniinowti. ! It* need not say

which he rclij,dously treasures in his ineinory. iias luvome a Paris 
of former times. Let him lie iK-rniitted to speak of that !*aris as if 
it still existed. It i.s possible lliat where the anth(»r is about to con« 
duct his readers, .saying: *Tn .sucli a stre«-t tluTe is siudi a honse,” 
there is now no longer either house or street, The reader will 
verify it, if he chooses to take the trinible. .‘\s to hiniself, the atrthor 
knows not the new Paris, and writes with ttie old Paris before his 
e^^es in an illiusion whieli i.s precious to him. It is a sweet thing for 
him to imagine tliat there still remains somelliiiig of what he saw 
when he wa.s in his own country, and that ,all is not vanished. Wliile 
we are living in our native lan’d. we fancy that these streets arc in- 
different to us, that these windows, these roofs, and these disirsare 
nothing to us, that these walls arc .strangers to its, iliat lltesc trees 
are no more than other trees, that these Itonscs which wc never 
enter are useless to us, that this pavement on which we walk is noth- 
ing but stone. In after time.s, when wc are there no longer, wc find 
tliat those streets are very dear, that we miss ihnsc r«&gt;ofs, those 
windows, and those .doors, that those walls arc necessary to us, that 
those trees are our well-beloved, that those houses which wc never 
entered we entered every day, and that we have left .something of 
our affections, our life, and our heart in those streets. All those 
places which we sec no more, which perha|» we shall never sec 
again, but the image of which wc have preserved, assume a mourn- 
ful charm, return to us with the sadness of a spectre, make the hdy

land visible to us, and are, so to speak, the very form of France; 
and vfe love them and call them up such as they are, such as they 
were, and hold to them, unwilling to change anything, for one clings 
to the form of his fatherland as to the face of his mother. 

Permit us, then, to speak of the past in the present. Saying 
which, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we proceed. 

Jean Valjean had immediately left the boulevard and began to 
thread the streets, making as many tunis as he could, returning 
sometimes uiwn his track to make sure that he was not followed. 

This mancEuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On ground where 
the foot leaves a mark, it has, among other advantages, that of de- 
ceiving the hunters and the dogs by the counter-step. It is what is 
called in vencry false reimbushment. 

The moon was full. Jean Valjean was not sorry for tlrat. The 
moon, still near the horizon, cut large prisms of light and shade in 
the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along the houses and the walls 
on the dark side and observe the light side. He did not, perhaps, suf- 
ficiently realise that the ol)scure side escaped him. Plowever, in all the 
deserted little streets in the neighbourhood of the Rue de Poliveau; 
he felt sure that no one was behind him. 

Cosette walked without asking any questions. The sufferings of 
the first six years of her life had introduced something of the pas- 
sive into her nature. Besides — and this is a remark to which we 
shall have more than one occasion to return — she had become 
familiar, without being fully conscious of them, with the peculiar- 
ities of her good friend and the eccentricities of destiny. And then, 
she felt safe, being with him. 

Jean Valjean knew, no more than Cosette, where he was going. 
He trusted in Cod, as she trusted in him. It seemed to him that he 
also held some one greater than himself by the hand; he believed 
he felt a being leading him, invisible. Finally, he had no definite 
idea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure that this 
was Javert, and then it might be Javert, and Javert not know that 
he was Jean Valjean. Was he not disguised? was he not supposed 
to be dead? Nevertheless, singular things had happened within the 
last few days. He wanted no more of them. Pie was determined 
not to enter 'Gorheau House again. Like the animal hunted from his 
;den, he was looking for a hole to hide in until he could find one to 
"remain in. . , •. 

f Jean Valjean described many and varied labjxmths in the 
IQuartier Mouffetard, which was asleep already as if it were still 
imder the discipline of the middle age and theyol« of the curfew;

doubt whatever that if, perduince, they iiad sfuu^ht liis track, they 

had lost it. 

As eleven o^clock struck iii the tower Sana hhieuue &lt;!u Mont, 
he crossed the Rue de Pontoise in front (»i* tlu* Inireau of the Com- 
missary of Police, which is at Kih 14, Sunn* nanaents aflt^rwards, 
the instinct of which we have alrcruly spoken made liitu turn his 
head. At this moment he saw distinctly— thanks to tiie cunnnissary's 
lamp which revealed them— three men followm^;’ him qtiite near, 
pass one after another under this Irtmp on tlie datk side of the 
street. One of these men entered the passaj'e lemlintt' to tlie com- 
miswsary's house. The one in advance a|)peared to iiim «lecidedly 
suspicious. 

**Come, child said he U) (^)st*t^e, aial he made Imste to out of 
the Rue &lt;le J^ontoise* 

He made a circuit, went roniid the arcud«* t!os I ’au iarches, which 
was closed on acctmnt the lateni*ss of the h»tur, wallanl rapidly 
throuf^h the Rue de ri‘ 4 HH‘-di‘-l»tds and tin* Hue de rAiiuilete, and 
plun,t&gt;fed into the Hue ties Postes. 

There was a square there, where the (Vdleite Ihdiin now is, and 
from which liranches (dT the Hue XrTna*“Sain!v&gt;(,hiievievf\

through the Rue des P«istes. litis Htie des was in the thir- 

tcenth century inliahited by pedters. and its true name is Hue des 
Pots.) 

The moon lighted up this square fnightly. jt'un Valjean con- 
cealed himself in a doorway, ealculating that if i!*e a* inett were still 
following him, he could not fail to get a view of them when 
they crossed thi:‘ lighted space. 

In fact, three miinites had ma ela(*sed when ilte men atqiearcd.

Uncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean; happily, it still 
continued with these men. He took advantage of their hSitation - 
It was time lost for them, gained for him. He came out frJm ?he 
doorway in which he was concealed, and made his way into th^Rue

He pnifj- annoyed that his passage should have attracted obser-

A large cart was passing the Seine at the same time, and like him 
was going towards the right bank. This could be made of use. He 
co^d go the whole length of the bridge in the shade of this cart

mto a krge clear open space. He did not hesitate. Thw who fed-

he looked back. 

From the point where he was, lie coulil see the whole length of 
the bridge of Austerlitz. 

Four shadows, at that moment, entered upon tlie bridge'. 

These shadows were coming from the Janlin ties Plantes to- 
wards the right bank. 

These four shadows were the four men. 

Jean Valjean felt a .shudder like that »jf the tleer when he sees 
the hounds again uixm his track. 

One hope wa.s left him; it was that these men hatl not entered 
upon the hridge, and had nut jierceivetl liiin when he crossed the 
large square clear space leaiiing i'osette by tlte hand. 

In that case, by piniiging into the little street before him, if he 
could succeed in reaching the woud-yards, tin; marshes, the helds, 
the open grounds, he could e.scape. 

It seemed to him that he might trust hini.self to this .silent little 
street. He entered it.

SoNfi! three hundred paee.s on, he reaehed a pnim where the street 
forked. It divided into two streets, ilu! one turning nlf idtlitinely to

Why? 

Beeau.Hcthe left branch led towards the faubourg- that is to .say,

This wall, however, did not prevent Wbb ln&gt;m going further; it

was a wall forming the side of a cross alley, in which the street 
Jean Valjean was then in came to an end. 

Here again he must decide ; should he take the right or the left ? 
He looked to the right. The alley ran out to a space between some 
buildings that were mere shedsor barns, then terminated abruptly. 
The end of this blind alley was plain to be seen — a great white wall. 

He looked to the left. J he alley on this side was open, and, about 
two hundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was an 
affluent. In this direction lay safety. 

The ihstant Jean Valjean decided to turn to the left, to try to 
reach the street which he saw at the end of the alley, he perceived 
at the comer of the alley and the street towards which he was fust 
about going, a sort of black, _ motionless statue. 

It was a nian, who had just been posted there, evidently and 
who was waiting for him, guarding the passage. ’ 

Jean Valjean was startled. 

Ihis pal t of. Palis where Jean Valjean was, situated between the 
Faubourg Saint Antoine and the La Rupee, is one of those which 
have been entirely transformed by the recent works— a change for 
the worse, m the opinion of .some, a transfiguration, according to 
others. The vegetable gardens, the wood-yards, and the old build- 
ings are gone. 1 here are now broad new streets, amphitheatres, 
circuses, hippodromes, railroad depots, a prison, Mazas : progress 
as we see, with its corrective. ’ 

Half a century ago, in the common popular language, full of 
tradition, which obstinately calls ITnstitut Lcs Qmrtre Nations, 
and 1 Opera Comique Feydeau, the precise spot which Jean Val- 
jean had reached was called the Petit Fiepus. The Porte Saint 
Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barriere des Sergents, the Porcher- 
ons. theGahote, the Celestins, the Capuchins, the Mail, the Bourbe, 
the Arbre de Carcovie, the Petite Pologne, the Petit Piepus, these 
are names of the old Paris floating over into the new. The mertwflry 
of the people buoys over these waits of the past. 

The Petit Piepus, which in fact hardly had a real existence, and 
Was never more than a mere outline of a quarter, had almost the 
monkish aspect of a Spanish city. The roads were poorly taved, 
the streets were thinly built up. Beyond the two or three streets of 
which we are about to speak, there was nothing there but wall and 
solitude. Not a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a light here and there in 
the windows ; all the lights put out after ten o^Iock. Gardens, con- 
vents, wood-yards, market gardens, a few scattered low houses, 
and great walls as high as the houses. 

Such was the quarter in the last century, Tlw RwolcHSon had al- 
ready very mudi altered it. The republican aa^rities had pulled 
and run streets into and thtntih it 1^^ of 
rubbish had been esttsdmdhed dbana. Thnrty years ago, this quarter

was being gradually erased by tlie cnnstnuiion of new buildings. 
It is now completely blotted out* The I Vtit 1 hepus. tif wincli no pres- 
ent plan retains a trace, is dearly i’uough in&lt;li('atet! in the plan of

posite the Rue du Platre, and at Lynns by Jean Cirin, Rue 
Mcrciere, ala Prudence. The Petit Piepus ha&lt;l what \ve have just 
called a Y of streets, formed hy the Rue du (lirnnn Vert Saint 
Antoine dividing into two branches and taknig on tlie left the name 
Petite Rue Piepus and on the right tin* name &lt;*f the Ivue P* Ponceau. 
The two branches of the Y were at the tojpas liy a liar. This 

bar was culled the Rue Droit Mtir. The Rut* lN»Iiuieea!i emied 
there; the Petite Rtie .Piepus passerl beyond, risiiet towards the 
Marche Lenoir. He who, coming from tlie Seine, laMrlu^d the ex*

turning sharply at a right angle, hefru'e him the side wall of that 
street, and on his right a tnmeated &lt;ii!tafinn fd' the Rue Droit 
Mur, without thoroughfare, called the i hil de sav* iienrot. 

Jean Valjean was in this |&gt;lm*e. 

As we. have said, perceiving the black bu'm standing sentry at 
the corner of the Rue Dmit Murajidthe I VLie Rue Picjms, he was

What should he do ? 

There was now no time to ttirn back. Wbat he bad seen moving 
in the obsetirity some distance betuta! him, the ne ‘merit befi&gt;re, was 
undoubtedly Javert and his st|u;nl, javert luaTaliiy had tilreacly

was at the end, Javert, to all appearance, was ac»]nainb‘d with this 
little trap, and had taken his jmrautiuns by sending tme of his men 
to guard the exit. These conjeettires, like mtainties, whirled 
about wildly in jean Valjean*s troulded brain, as a handful dust 
flies before a smblfn lilast. lie scrnlinised tlie Ltd tie-sac Genrot; 
there were high walls. He sertttiitised the Petite Kne Picjiiis; there 
wn.s a sentinel. He saw the dark form repeated in black upon the

Jn order to understand what follows, it is neressary to form m 
txaci kleai&gt;f the little Rue Droit Mur. ami jaritrularly the corner 
which it makes at the left ns you leave the Kue Ptdoficenu to enter 
this iilley. The little Rue Droit Mur was aliiiosi entirely lined on 



COSETTE 385 

the right, as far as the Petite Rue Picpus, by houses of poor ap- 
pearance ; on the left by a single building of severe outline, com- 
posed of several structures which rose gradually a story or two, one 
above another, as they appi’oached the Petite Rue Picpus, so that 
the building, very high on the side of the Petite* Rue Ricpus, was 
quite low on the side of the Rue Polonceau, There, at the corner 
of which he have spoken, it became so low as to be nothing more 
than a wall. This wall did not abut squarely on the corner, which 
was cut off diagonally, leaving a considerable space that was 
shielded by the two angles thus formed from observers at a dis- 
tance in either the Rue Polonceau, or the Rue Droit Mur. 

From these two angles of the truncated corner, the wall extended 
along the Rue Polonceau as far as a house numbered 49, and along 
the Rue Droit Mur, where its height was much less, to the sombre- 
looking building of which we have spoken, cutting its gable, and 
thus making a new re-entering angle m the street. This gable had 
a gloomy aspect; there was but one window to be seen, or rather 
two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc, and always closed. 

The situation of the places which we describe here is rigorously ^ 
exact, and we certainly awaken a very precise remembrance in the 
minds of the old inhabitants of the locality. 

This truncated corner was entirely filled by a thing which seemed 
like a colossal and miserable door. It was a vast shapeless assem- 
blage of perpendicular planks, broader above than below, bound 
together by long transverse iron bands. At the side there was a 
porte-cochere of the ordinary dimensions, which had evidently been 
cut in within the last fifty years. * 

A lime-tree lifted its branches above this corner, and the wall was 
covered with ivy towards the Rue Polonceau. 

In the imminent peril of Jean Valjean, this sombre building 
had a solitary and uninhabited appearance which attracted him. He 
glanced over it rapidly. He thought if he could only succeed in g^" 
ting into it, he would perhaps be safe. Hope came to him with the 
idea. 

Midway of the front of this building on the Rue Droit Mur, there 
■ were at all the windows of the different stories old leaden waste- 

? ipes. The varied branchings of the tubing which was continued 
rom a central conduit to each of these waste-pipes, outlined on the 
faqade a sort of tree. These ramifications of the pipes with their 
'hundred elbows seemed like those old closely-pruned grape-vines 
fvhich twist about over the front of ancient farm-houses. 

I This grotesque espalier, with its sheet-iron branches, was the 
i|rst object which Jcm Valjean saw. He s«d36d Coselle; with her 
feck a^inst a post, and, telling her to be ran to the spot 
where the conduit came to the pavement. Fethaj^ there was some 
■leans of scaling, the, ws^ by Jhat arid witerisg the house. But the 



386 L E S M I S R A n L K S 

conduit was dilapidated and out of use. aiul .scarcely held by its 
fastening. Besides, all the windows of ihis .siliait hmi.se were pro- 
tected by thick bars of iron, even the doriner wimiows. .■\nd then 
the moon shone full upon this £:n;adc, and the man w!it) was watch- 
ing from the end of the street would have seen Jean Valjcan mak- 
ing the escalade. And then what should lie tlo w.ih t u.sette? iiow 
could he raise her to the top of a three-story house ? 

He gave up climbing by the cunduit, and crept along the wall to 
the Rue Polonceau. 

When he reached this flattened corner where lu* had left Cosette, 
he noticed that there no one could see him. He escapetl, as we have 
just explained, all oliservalion from every side, rtesides, he was in 
the slvide. Then there were two doors. Teihaii-s they might be 
forced. The wall, above which he .saw the lime and the ivy, evi- 
dently surrounded a garden, where he eouid at least eonct‘:d him- 
self, although there were no leavc.s on the tree.s yet, ami pas.s the 
rest of the night. 

Time was passitig. He must act (piickly. 

Hclried the carriage door, and found ;il once that it was fa.sleiie(l 
within and without. 

lie apiiroached the oilier large tlo«&gt;r with more hupte. It was 
frightfully decrepit, its immense .size even lendering it less solid; 
the planks were rotten, the iron fastenings, of which there were 
three, were rustetl, It semned jjossihk* to jderve this worm-eaten 
structure. 

On examining it, he saw that this door w;is not a door. It had 
neither hinges, hraces.'lock, nor crack in tlie middle. The iron lands 
cro.ssed from one side to the other without a break, 'riirotigh the 
crevices of the jilanks lu: .saw the rubble-WMik arul stones, roughly 
cemcnte&lt;l, which i«i.ssfr.s-by conld have sien willnii the !a-t ten 
years. He was conipe!!ed_ to admit witli eon-*iernruion that this ap- 
pearance of a door wa.s .simply an ornamentation in wood of a w.dl, 
upon which it was pku'ed. It \v.as e.tsy to trur otf a luiard, but then he 
would find hi(n.self face ts:i face witfi a wall.

COSETTE 387 

The soldiers, at whose head he distinguished the tall form of 
Javert, advanced slowly and with precaution. They stopped fre- 
quently. It was plain they were exploring all the recesses of the 
walls and all the entrances of doors and alleys. 

It was — and here conjecture could not be deceived^ — some patrol 
which Javert had met and which he had put in requisition. 

Javert’s two assistants marched in the ranks. 

At the rate at which they were marching, and the stops they 
were making, it would take them about a quarter of an hour to 
arrive at the spot where Jean Valjean was. It was a frightful mo- 
ment. A few minutes separated Jean Valjean from that awful 
precipice which was opening before him for the third time. And 
the galleys now were no longer simply the galleys, they were Cosette 
lost for ever; that is to say, a life in death. 

There was now only one thing possible. 

Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he might be said to carry 
two. knapsacks ; in one he had the thoughts of a saint, in the other 
the fomiidablc talents of a convict. He helped himself from one 
or the other as occasion required. 

Among other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes froiri 
the galleys at Toulon, he had, it will be remembered, become master 
of that incredible art of raising himself, in the right angle of a wall, 
if need to be to the height of a sixth story ; an art without ladders 
or props, by mere tnusclar strength, supporting himself by the back 
of his neck, his .shoulders, his hips, and his knees, hardly making 
use of the few projections of the stone, which rendered so terrible 
' and so celebrated the corner of the yard of the Conciergerie of Paris' 
by which, some twenty years ago, the convict Battemolle made his- 
escape. 

Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he 
saw the lime tree. It was about eighteen feet high. The angle that 
it macle with the gable of the great building was filled in its lower 
part with a pile of masonry of triangular shape, probably intended 
to preserve this too convenient recess from a too public use. This- 
preventive filling-up of the corners of a wall is very common in 
Paris. 

3'his pile yrgs about five feet high. From its top the space to 
climb to get upon the wall wa.s hardly more than fourteen feet. 

The wall was capjwd by a flat stone without any projection. 

The difficulty was Cosette. Cosette did not know how to scale a 
wall. Abandon her ? Jean Valjean did not think of it. To carry her 
was impossible. The whole strength of a man is necessary to ac- 
complish these strange ascents. The least burden would make him 
lose his centre of gravity and he would fail. 

* He needed a cord. Jean Valjean had none. Where coaid he find 

cord, at midnight, in the Rue Poloocean? Truly at that instant, if 



388 L E s M I s E R A n r. s 

Jean Valjcan had had a kingdom, he \v&lt; &gt;uld have ven it for a rope. 

All extreme situations have their Hashes which sometimes make 
us blind, sometimes illuminate us. 

The despairing gaze of Jean Valjcan encouiUcred tlu* lanjjj-post 
in the Cul-de-sac Genrot. 

At this epoch there were no gas-lights in tin* streets of Ikiris. At 
nightfall they lighted the streets lamps, which were plactsl ;i.t inter- 
vals, and were raised and lowererl hy nuN'ins of a r« v|h’ traversing the 
street from end to end, running through the grruoa^s of posts.* The 
reel on which this ro|)e was wound was incliea*d heh»w the lantern 
in a little iron box, the key of which was kej&gt;t hy the lamp-lighter 
and the rope itself was pa-otccted hy a casing ai metal, ^ ^ 

Jean Valjcan, with the energy of a final strugt»h% crossed the 
street at a liound, entere&lt;l tlu! i-nl-de-sac, sprang tin* holt of the 
little box with the point of his knife, and an instant after was hack 
at the side of Coseite. He had a mpe. These desperate invt*ntors of 
expedients, in their struggles with fatality, mt&gt;ve electrically in case 
of need. 

We have explained that the street lamps IkmI not Iieen lighted 
that night. The lamp in the C’ul-tle-sac t Ivmot was then, as a matter 
of course, extinguished like the rest, am! taie might pass hv with- 
out even noticing timt it was imt in its place. 

Meanwhile tlie hour, the place, tlie darkness, tlu* prrotTUj&gt;ation 
of Jean Valjcan, his singular actions, his going to and fro, all this 
began to disturb Coseite. Any other child wt&gt;nld Itave tittered loud 
cries long before. She amtented herself with pulling jean Valjean 
by the skirt of his emt d'he soutui of the approachiiig patrol was 
constantly becoming more and more disilnti. 

‘‘Father,” $ai&lt;! she, in a whisper, *i am afraid. Wdm is it that is 
coming ?” 

“Hush!” answered the unhapjiy man, “it is tlie dltcnardiess.” 

Coseite shiidderetl He added: 

“Don’t say a wt»rd : 111 take care of her, 1 i vm erv, if von make 
any noise, the Thciiardiess will hear vote She is coming to catch 
you,” 

^ Then, without any haste* but without doinr: anvifutig a second 
time, with a firm and ni|m] decisuni, so much tlie more runarkalde 
at such a moment when the |mtrol and javert might ctmit* u|*on him 
at any instant, he took otT his cravat, i&gt;;issrsi it iiround Cosette’s 
iKxly under the arms, taking care that it shoub! nai Imrt the child, 
attached this cravat to an end of the rope bv ineauH of tlie knot 
which seamen call a swallow-knot, tiH*k Iht* otlier end of the rujte in 
lus teeth, took oft* his shoes and stockings ami threw iheiii uwf the 
wall, climlHHl upon the pile of masonry and began to raise himself 
in the angle of the wall and the gable with iis much salitlity and cer- 
tamty as if he had the rounds of a ladder under his heels and his 



COSETTE 2^J 

elbows. Half a minute had not passed before he was on his knees 
on the wall. 

Cosette watched him, stupefied, without saying a word. Jean Val- 
Jean’s charge and the name of the Thenardiess had made her dumb 

All at once, she heard Jean Valjean’s voice calling to her in a low 
whisper: 

“Put your back against the wall.” 

She obeyed. 

“Don’t speak, and don’t be afraid,” added Jean Valjean. 

And she felt herself lifted from the ground. 

Before she had time to think where she was she was at the 
top of the wall. 

Jean Valjean seized her, put her on his back, took her two little 
hands m his left hand, lay down flat and crawled along the top of 
wall as far as the cut-off corner. As he had supposed, there was a 
building there, the roof of which sloped from the top of the wooden 
casing we have mentioned very nearly to the ground, with a gentle 
inclination, and just reaching to the lime-tree. 

_ A fortunate circumstance, for the wall was much higher on this 
side than on the street. Jean Valjean saw the ground beneath him at 
a great depth. 

ffe had just reached the inclined plane of the roof, and had not 
yet left the crest of the wall, when a violent uproar proclaimed the 
arrival of the patrol. He heard the thundering voice of Javert: 

“Search the cul-de-sac ! The Rue Droit Mur is guarded, the Pet- 
ite Rue Picpus also. I’ll answer for it if he is in the cul-de-sac.” 

The soldiers ru.shed into the Cul-de-sac Genrot. 

Jean Valjean .slid down the roof, keeping hold of Cosette, reached 
the lime-tree, and jumped vo the ground. Whether from terror, or 
from courage, Cosette had not tittered a whisper. Her hands were 
a little scraped. 


VI 

COMMENCEMENT OF AN ENIGMA 

Jean Valjean found himself In a sort of garden, veiy large and 
of a singular appearance ; one oi those gloomy gardens which seem 
made to be .seen in the winter and at night. This garden was oblong, 
with a row of large poplars at the lUrthcrend, some tall forest trees 
i. in the corners, and a clear space in the centre, where stood a very 
large isolated tree, then a few fruit trees, contorted and shaggy, like 
i big bushes, some vegetable beds, a melon patch the glass covers of 
t which shone in the moonlight, and an old well. There were here and 
J there stone benches which seemed.black with laoss. The Walks were 
I bordered with sorry little shrulM pwf^^efara^. The grass cov- 
I ered hdf of fl»m, and a greba mtm ooiviired"the rest. 



390 L E S M I S fi R A B L E S 

Jean Valjean had on one side the biuUlin.j{, &lt;lo\vn the roof of 
which he had come, a wood-pile, and bchiml the wood, against the 
wall, a stone statue, the mutilated face of which was now nothing 
but a shapeless mask which was seen dinily through tlie obscurity. 

■The building was in ruins, but some dismantled rooms could be 
distinguished in it, one of which was well Idled, ami appeared to 
serve as a shed. 

The large building of the Rue Droit Mur which ran hack on the 
Petite Rue Piepus, presented uix^n tliis garden two .stjuare facades. 
These inside facades were .still more glnoiny than those on the out- 
side. All the windows weregrate&lt;i. No light w.-is to Ik* seen. On the 
upper stories there were shutters as in prisons. 'Phe sluulmv of one 
of these facades was projected uihui the other, and fell &lt;!n the gar- 
den like an inimen.se black pall. 

No other house could he seen. 'I'he further eml of the gartien was 
lost in mist and in darkness. Still, he could nuiUe nut w.alls inter- 
secting, as if there were other cultivated grounds beyond, as wtdl as 
the low roofs of the Rue Polonceau. 

Nothing can he imagined more wild and more solitary than this 
garden. There was no one there, whieli was very natural on .'iccount 
of the hour ; Iiut it did not seetn as if the place were made for any- 
body to walk in, even in hrtiad mion. 

Jean Valjeruds first care had been to liml his shoes, and fiut them 
on; then he entered the .shed with fosette. A man trying to escape 
never thinks him.self sufficiently concealed. Tlic child, thinking con- 
stantly of the Thenardiess, sli.ared hi.s instinct, and cowered clown 
as closely a.s she could. 

Cosette tremliled, and pressed closely to his .side, 'rhey heard the 
tanmltuous clamour of the patrol rans'aciving tlie cul*de*ku; aiul the 
street, the datter of their nuiskels againsi the stones, tin; calls of 
Javert to the watchmen he had siaiiomsl, am! his imprecations 
mingled with words which they could not distinguish. 

At the end of a rjuarter of an hour it seemed .as though this 
stormy nnnhliiig heg,an to rwede. Jean Valjean diil not hretUhe. 

He had placwl his hand gw iy ujton rosette's snmtili. 

But the solitude alwul him was so .strfiiigcly calm that that fright- 
ful din, so furious and s«&gt; near, dkl not even cast over it a shadow 
of disturbance. It seemed as if these walls were built of the deaf 
stones spoketj td in Scripture, 

Suddenly, in the midst of this dce{&gt; calm, a new sound arose; a 
celestial, divine, ineffable sound, as ravishing as the other was hor- 
rible. It was a hytun wliich came forth from ilie darkness, a bewild- 
ering iningliiig of prayer and hamtony in the obsetire and fearful 
sdence of the night ; voices of women, but voices with the pure ac- 
cents of virgins, and artless accents of children; those voices which 
are not of earth, and witich resemble those that the new-born still 



COSETTE 391 

hear, and the dying hear already. This song came from the gloomy 
building which overlooked the garden. At the moment when the up- 
roar of the demons receded, one would have said, it was a choir of 
angels approaching in the darkness. 

Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees. 

They knew not what it was ; they knew not where they were ; but 
they both felt, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, 
that they ought to be on their knees. 

These voices had this strange effect ; they did not prevent the 
building from appearing deserted. It was like a supernatural song 
in'an uninhabited dwelling. 

While these voices were singing Jean Valjean was entirely ab- 
sorbed in them. He no longer saw the night, he saw a blue sky. He 
seemed to feel the spreading of these wings which we all have with- 
in us. 

The chant cea.sed. Perhaps it had lasted a long time. Jean Valjean 
could not have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment. 

All had again relapsed into silence. There was nothing more in 
the street, nothing more in the garden. That which threatened, that 
which reassured, all had vanished. The wind rattled the dry grass 
on the top of the wall, which made a low, soft, and mournful noise. 


, VII 

THE ENIGMA CONTINUED 

The night wind hid risen, which indicated that it must be between 
one and two o’clock in the morning. Poor Cosette did not speak. As 
she had sat down at his side and leaned her head on him, Jean Val- 
jean thought that she was a,sleep. He bent over and looked at her. 
Her eyes were wide open, and she had a look that gave Jean Val- 
jean pain. 

She was still trembling, 

"Are you sleepy ?" .said Jean Valjean. 

“I am very cold,” she answered. 

A moment after she added ; 

"Is she there yet ?” 

"Who ?*' said Jean Valjean. 

"Madame Thdnardier.^’ 

Jean Valjean Imd already forgotten the means he had «ni4oyed 
to secure Cosette's silence. 

"Oh !” said he. "She hw gone. Don’t be afiaid any longw." 

The child si^d as if a weight were lifted from hee breast

“Are you wanner, so ?” 

“Oh lyes, father!” 

“Well, wait here a moment for me. I shall sihui 1h* hack.” 

He went out of the ruin, and nloiif,'' hy tlie lar,i;e lmiUlin|r^ in 
search of some better shelter. He ftaitul doors, hut they were all 
closed. All the windows of the ftround-tloor were barred.’ 

As he passed the interior ani,de of the huildiiif', he. noticed several 
arched windows before him, where he perceived some lii^ht. I le rose 
on tiptoe and looked in at one of these windows. 'I hey all 0{&gt;ened 
* into a large hall, paved with broad slabs, and intersected by arches 
and pillars, he could distinguish nothing but a sligitt glimmer in the 
deep obscurity. Thi.s glimmer came from a iiight-Iamp burning in a 
corner. The hall was &lt;lesertcd: everytbiug was motionless. How- 
ever, by dint of looking, he thought he .saw something, stretehed out 
on the pavement, which appeare&lt;l to !&gt;e covered with :i shroud, and 
which rescmbksl a hitman form. It was Iving with the face down- 
wards, the arms crossed, in the immoliility of death. One would 
have said, from a sort of .serpent which trailed :ilong the itavement, 
that this ill-omened figure Itul a ropealntut its neek. 

'I'he whole h.'dl was enveloped in tli.at mist jteculiar to dimly- 
lighteti places, which always increases horror. 

Je;m Valjcan has often said .since that, although in the course of 
his life he had .seen many fnnereal sights, never had he .seen any- 
thing more freezing ami more terrible than this enigmatical figure 
fulfilling .some strange mystery, he knew not what, in that gloomy 
place, ami thus dimly seen in tl’jc night. It was terrifying to suppoM 
that it was perhap.s dead, and still nwre terrifying to think that it 
might be alive. 

He had the courage to press Ins forehead against the gl.a8.s, and 
watch to .see if the thing wonkl snove. I Ic remaine«l what seemed to 
him a long time in vain ; the prostrate form made no movement. 
Suddenly he was stdze»l with an inexpressilde dismay, atul lie fled. 
He ran towards the shed withont ilaring to inuk Isehind him. It 
seemed to him that if he shmild turn his head he wouhl seetlse figure 
walking behind him witli rajtid strides and shaking its arms. 

He reached the ruin hreafhles.s. His knees gave wav :a eold sweat 
oozed out from every jsire. 

Where wa.s he? who would ever have imagined anything «(ual 
to this species of sepulchre in the midst of Paris? what was this 
strange luuise ? A huilding full of nocturtial mystery, calling to souls 
in the .shade with the voice of angels, and, when they came, abruptly 
pre.seniing to them this frightful vision — promising to mien the ra- 
diant gate of Heaven and oitening the horrible door of the tomb. 
And that was In fact a Ijuilding, a house which had its mimlier in a 
street ? It was not a tiream ? He had to touch the walls to helievc it. 

The cold, the anxiety, the agitation, the anguish of the night, were 



COSETTE 393 

giving him a veritable fever, and all his ideas were jostling in his 
brain. 

He went to Cosette. She was sleeping, 

VIII 

THE ENIGMA REDOUBLES 

The child had laid her head upon a stone and gone to sleep. 

He sat down near her and looked at her. Little by little, as he be- 
held her, he grew calm, and regained possession of his clearness of 
mind. 

He plainly perceived this truth, the basis of his life henceforth, 
that so long as she should be alive, so long as he should have her 
with him, he should need nothing except for her, and fear nothing 
save on her account. He did not even realise that he was very cold, 
having taken off his coat to cover her. 

Meanwhile, through the reverie into which he had fallen, he had 
heard for some time a singular noise. It sounded like a little bell 
that some one was shaking. This noise was in the garden. It was 
heard distinctly, though feebly. It resembled the dimly heard tink- 
ling of cow-bells in the pastures at night. 

This noise made Jean Valjean turn. 

He looked, and saw that there was some one in the garden. 

Something which resembled a man was walking among the glass 
cases of the melon patch, rising up, stooping down, stopping, with 
a regular motion, as if he were drawing or stretching something 
upon the ground. This being appeared to limp. 

Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the outcast. 
To them everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day 
because it helps to discover them, and the night because it helps to 
surprise them. Just now he was shudderjng because the garden was 
empty, now he shuddered because there was some one in it. 

He fell again from chimerical terrors into real terrors. He said 
to himself that perhaps Javert and his spies had not gone away, that 
they had doubtless left somebody on the watch in the street ; that, 
if this man should discover him in the garden, he would cry thief, 
and would deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently^ in 
his arms and carried her into the furthest corner of the shed behind 
a heap of old furniture that was out of use, Cosette did not stir. 

From there he watched the strange motions of the man in the 
melon patch. It seemed very singular, but the sound of the Ml fol- 
V)wed every movement of the man. When the man ^proached, the 
sound approached; when he moved aTTOy&gt; the soutm moved away; 
if he made some sudden motion, a trill awomp^ied the motion ; 
when he stopped, the noise ccas^ It seemed evident that the bell 



394 L E S M 1 S E R A U 1, K S 

was fastened to this man ; but then what couiil that mean ? what was 
this man to whom a bell was hunjf as to a ram ur a cow ? 

While he was revolving these questions, he touched Cosette’s 
hands. They were icy. 

“Oh ! God !" sauUic. 

He called to her in a low voice : 

“Cosette!” 

She &lt;lid not open her eyes. 

He shook her .smartly. 

She did not wake. 

“Could she he dead?" said ho, and he sprang tip, shuddering 
from head to foot. 

The most frightful thoughts rushed through Ids mind in confu- 
sion. There are moments \v!u&gt;n Iddeons sujipfisititins iH'siege us like 
a throng of furies and violently foree the portals of nnr brain. 
When those whom we love are in dani;er. ottr soliriimle invents all 
sorts of follie.s. He reinemhered that sleep may he t.atal in the ojicn 
air in a cold night.

TUK MAN WITH TlfK Hl't.t, 

Hr walk&lt;‘d sfniight to th? in.tn whom be saw in the garelun. He 
had l.-tken in his hand tiie roll of money which svas in his vest-jmeket. 

This inan lifid his head ilown, and dni mil .see Ivini ctiming. A 
few strides, jean Valjean was at his side. 

Jean Valjean approached him, e.Nclainiing ; 

“A hundred fr.nics!" 

The man .started and raiscil his eyes. 

“A hundred francs for ycHi," contimied V‘.aljean, “if you 
will give me refuge tn-night," 

'I lu* moon .shone full in jean Valjean'* licwildcred face, 

“What, it is yon, Father Madeicinr!" said the nuin. 

This name, thus jironmincetl. at thi* dark hour, in ihi# unknown 
place, !&gt;y this tinknown man. made Jean Valjean start back. 

He was ready for anything but tnat. The apeakcr wa* an old man, 
bent and lame, dressed much like a peasant, who luul on hia left

knee a leather knee-cap from which hung a bell. His face was in the 
shade, and could not be distinguished. 

Meanwhile the goodman had taken off his cap, and was exclaim, 
ing, tremulously : 

“Ah ! my God ! how did you come here. Father Madeleine ? How 
did you get in, O Lord ? Did you fall from the sky ? There is no 
doubt, if you ever do fall, you will fall from there.vAnd what has 
happened to you? You have no cravat, you have no hat, you have 
no coat ? Do you know that you would have frightened anybody 
who did not know you ? No coat ? Merciful heavens ! are the saints 
all crazy now? But how did you get in?” 

One word did not wait for another. The old man spoke with a 
rustic volubility in which there was nothing disquieting. All this 
was said with a mixture of astonishment, and frank good nature. 

"Who are you? and what is this house 1” asked Jean Valjean. 

“Oh ! indeed, that is good now,” exclaimed the old man. “I am 
the one you got the place for here, and this house is the one you got 
me the place in. What ! you don’t remember me ?” 

“No,” said Jean Valjean. “And how does it happen that you 
know me?” 

“You saved my life," said the man. 

He turned, a ray of the moon lighted up his side face, and Jean 
Valjean recognised old Fauchelevent. 

“Ah !” said Jean Valjean, “it is you ? yes, I remember you." 

“That is very fortunate!” said the old man, in a reproachful 
tone. 

“And what are you doing here?” added Jean Valjean. 

“Oh ! I am covering my melons.” 

Old Fauchelevent had in his hand, indeed, at the moment when 
Jean Valjean accosted him, the end of a piece of awning which he 
was stretching out over the melon patch. He had already spread out 
several in this way during the hour he had been in the garden. It 
was this work which made him go through the peculiar motions ob- 
served by Jean Valjean from the shed. 

; He continued : 

I “I said to myself : the moon is bright, there is going to be a frost. 
/Suppose I put their jackets on my melons? And," added he, looking 

Jean Valjean, with a loud laugh, “you would have done well to 
1^0 as much for yourself ? but how did you come here T‘ 

I' Jean Valjean, finding that he was known by this man, at tewst 
&amp;der his name of Madeleine, went no further with his precauticte. 
Ke multiplied questions. Oddfy enough tlwir part® seemed reversed; 
» was he, the intreder, who put questions. 

“And what is this bell you have on your knee?” 

"That J’^answered Faachdevent, “liart i® so they may keep 
ipiray from me.” 



396 L E S M I S E K A K L E S 

“How ! keep away from you ?" 

01(1 Fauchclevent winked" in an indescrilialtle manner. 

“Ah! BkwSS me! there’s nothing hut women in this liouse; plenty 
of young girls. It seenrs that I am dangerous to meet. I'he hell warns 
them. When I come they go away.” 

“What is this house ?” 

“Why, you know very well.” 

“No, I don’t.” 

“Why, you got me this place here as gardener.” 

“Answer me as if I didn’t know.” 

“Well, it is the Convent of the I’etit i ’icpus, then.” 

Jean Valjean rememhered. Chance, tltat is to say. Providence, 
had thrown him precisely into this convent &lt;ii the tjuartier .Saint 
Antoine, to which old Faucheku’ent:, crippleil in- hi.s fall from his 
cart, had been admitted, upon his recommendation, two years be- 
fore. He repeated as if he were talking to himself : 

“The Convent of the I’etit I’icpnsj” 

“But now, really,” rcstuned I'anchelevent, “how the deuce did 
you manage to get in, you, Imther Madeleine? It is no use for you 
to l)e a saint, you are ;i m:m ; and no men come in here.” 

“Rut you are here.” 

“There is none hut me.” 

“Rut,” resumed Jean \'aljean, “I umst stay heft*.” 

“Oh ! my Ciod,” e.\claimed hauchelevetU. 

Jean Valjean approached the old man, and said to him in a grave 
Voice: 

“Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.” 

"I w.a.s first to rememlier it," answereil Iniuehelevent. 

“Well, you can now do for me what 1 once did for yon." 

Fauchelevent grasited in his (tld wrinkled and Irem'hling hands 
the robust hands of Jean Vtdjean, and it was .some seconds before 
he could speak ; at la.sl he exclaimed : 

“Oh! that wotild Iwa blessing of Ctwl if I coidd do something for 
you, in return for that! I save your life! Monsieur Mavor, the old 
man is at your disixisal." 

A wonderful joy had, as it were, triinsfignrnl the old gardener. 
A radiance seemetl to shine forth from his face. 

“What do yon want me to do ?" he added. 

“I will e.xplain. You Imve a room ?" 

“I have a solitary shanty, over there, heliind the rnhis of the old 
convent, in a corner that nohody ever .see.s. There are three rooms.” 

The shanty was in fact so well concealed liehind the ruins, and so 
Well arranged, that no one should see it— that jean Valjean had not 
seen it 

"Good,” said Jean Valjean. “Now I a.sk of you two things." 
“What are they, Monsieur Madeleine?” 



COSETTE 397 

“First, that you will not tell anybody what you know about me. 
Second, that you will not attempt to learn anything more.” 

“As you please. I know that you can do nothing dishonourable, 
and that you have always been a man of God. And then, besides, 
it was you that put me here. It is your place, I am yours.” 

“Very well. But now come with me. We will go for the child.” 

“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “there is a child!” ! 

Fie said not a word more, but followed Jean Valjean as a dog f ol- ' 
lows his master. 

In half an hour Cosette, again become rosy before a good fire, 
was asleep. in the old gardener’s bed. Jean Valjean had put on his 
cravat and coat ; his hat, which he had thrown over the wall, had 
been found and bi-ought in. While Jean Valjean was putting on his 
coat, Fauchelevent had taken off his knee-cap with the bell attached, 
which now, hanging on a nail near a shutter, decorated the wall. 
The two men were warming themselves, with their elbows on a 
table, on which Fauchelevent had set a piece of cheese, some brown 
bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man said to 
Jean Valjean, putting his hand on his knee : 

“Ah ! Father Madeleine ! you didn’t know me at first ? You save 
people’s lives and then you forget them ? Oh ! that’s bad ; they re- 
member you. You are ungrateful 1”

IN WHICH IS EXPLAINED HOW JAVERT LOST THE GAME 

The events, the reverse of which, so to speak, we have just seen^ 
had been brought about under the simplest conditions. 

When Jean Valjean, on the night of the very day that Javert] 
arrested him at the death-bed of Fantine, escaped from the munici-' 

pal prison of M sur M -, the police supposed that the es- ' 

,caped convict would start for Paris. Paris is a maelstrom in which ‘ 
everything is lost ; and everything disappears in this whirlpool of 
the world as in the whirlpool of the sea. No forest conceals a man 
like this multitude. Fugitives of all kinds know this. They go to 
Paris to be swallowed up ; there are swallowings-up which save. The 
police know it also, and it is in Paris that they search for what they 
: have lost elsewhere. They searched there for the ex-mayor of 

p M sur M Javert was summoned to Paris to aid in the in- 

; yestigation. Javert, in fact, was of great aid in the recapture of Jean 
i Waljean, The zeal and intelligence of Javert on this occasion were re- 
marked by M. Chabouillet, Secretary of the Prefecture, under 
; Count Angles. M, Chabouillet, who had already interested himself 

gin Javert, secured the transfer of the inspector of M sur 

to the police of Paris. There Javert rendered himself in va- 



398 L E S M I S f? R A lU- K S 

rious ways, and, let us say, aliliuiij^h ihe wuni seems unusual for 

such service, honourably, useful. 

He thought no more of Jean Vualjean — witli these hounds .always 
upon the scent, the wolf of to-day Ijanishes tlie memory of the wolf 
of yesterday — when, in Dcccmlier, 1823, he read a newspaper, he 
who never read the newspapers; init Javert, as a uuman liist. made 
a point of knowing the details of the triiiinplial entry of tiu; “Prince 
generalissimo” into Bayonne, just as he finidiwl tin* aitielt! which 

interested him, a name — the tirmie of Je.ait \'aljeati at the hottom 

of the page attracted his attention. 'I’lie newspaper atmonneed that 
the convict J c.an \^aljc,an w.as dead, .and ptuldi/.lusl the faet in terms 
so explicit, that J.avcrt had no donht of it. lie inert ly sai.l; '‘That 
settles it.” Then he threw aside the paper, anti tluaight no more of 
it. 

Some time .afterwards it li.appened tltat a police notiee was tnins- 
mitteelby the Prefecture of Seiiie-ef-t )ise to tlie Prefecture of Po- 
lice of Paris in ndation to the kitinapping of a chilli, which had 
taken place, it was saiil, niuler peculiar circumstances, in the com- 
mune of Montfcnneil. A little girl, seven or eight years olil, the 
notiee .said, who had been contiiled by her mother to an innkeeper 
of the country, had heen stolen hy an unknown man ; this little girl 
answered to the name of ( osetle, and was ilicehiki of ,i voung wo- 
man named bantine, wlio had dinl ;it the Hospital, iiohody knew 
when or where. This notice came under ihe eyes of javert, and set 
him to thinking. 

The name of Fantiiie was well known to him. He remembered 
that Jean Valjean had actually made him Javert -laugh aloud by 
asking of him a respite of three days, in order to g,u for the child 
of this creature. He recalled t!»* fact tlttt jean k aljean had Itcea 
arrested at Parts, at the moinent lie was getting into the ^lontfcr- 
meil diligence. Some iijdic.atii«is Iwd even led him to tliiuk then 
that it was the .second tihie tltat he wjts emeriiig this diligence, and 
that he h.id alreaily, the night previrnts, made another ewursion to 
the environs of this village, for he had not Iteeii seen in the vilktge 
itself. What was he doing in tltis region of Montfmueil ? .N’olwidy 
could divine, javert undersiood it, I he daughter of intnlinc was 
there. Jean Valjean was going after her. Now this Hiilil Itad been 
stolen by tin unlatowm man! Who could tliis lu.ut Iw? t V.uld it lie 
jean Valjean? But jean Valjean was dead. Javert, withom stiying 
a word to any one, took the tliligence at the Hat 4‘Etain. cul-dc-sac 
de Planchetfe, and took a trip to Monfermeil, 

He expected to find great clevebpmenis iherc ; he fmiiid great 
oh.scurity. 

For the first few days, die Thinardiers, in their spite, had 
blablted the story about. I'he disappearance of the Lark had made 
some noise in the village. There were soaii several versitnts of the 



COSETTE 399 

Story, which ended by becoming a case of kidnapping. Hence the 
police notice. However, when the first ebullition was over, Thenar- 
dier, with admirable instinct, very soon arrived at the conclusion 
that it is never useful to set in motion the Procureur du Roi ; that 
the first result of his complaints in regard to the kidnapping of Cos- 
ette would be to fix upon himself, and on many business troubles 
which he had, the keen eye of justice. The last thing tliat owls wish 
is a candle. And first of all, how should he explain the fifteen hun- 
dred francs he had received? He stopped short, and enjoined se- 
crecy upon his wife, and professed to be astonished when anybody 
spoke to him of the stolen child. He knew nothing about it ; undoubt- 
edly he had made some complaint at the time that the dear little 
girl should be “taken away” so suddenly ; he would have liked, for 
affection’s sake, to keep her two or three days ; but it was her 
“grandfather” who had come for her, the most natural tiling in the 
world. He liad added the grandfather, which sounded well. It was 
upon this story that Javert fell on reaching Montfermeil. The 
grandfather put Jean Valjean out of the question. 

Javert. however, dropped a few questions like plummets into 
Thenardier’s story. Who was this grandfather, and what was his 
name ? Thenardier answered with simplicity “He is a rich farmer, 
I saw his passport. I believe his name is M. Guillaume Lambert.” 

Lambert is a very respectable reassuring name. Javert returned 
to Paris. 

“Jean Valjean is really dead,” said he, “and I am a fool.” 

He had begun to forget all this story, when, in the month of 
March, 1824, he heard an odd person spoken of who lived in the 
parish of Saint Medard, and who was called “the beggar who gives 
alms.” This per.son wa,s, it was said, a man living on his income, 
whose name nobody knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little 
girl eight years old, who knew nothing of herself except that she 
came from Montfermeil. Montfermeil! This name constantly re- 
curring, excited Javert’s attention anew. An old begging police 
spy, formerly a beadle, to whom this person had extended his char- 
ity, added some other details. “This man was very unsociable, never 
going out except af night, speaking to nobody, except to the poor 
sometimes, and allowing nobody to get acquainted with him. He 
wore a horrible old yellow coat which was worth millions, being 
lined all over with bank bills.” This decidedly piqued Javert’s cur- 
iosity. That he might get a near view of this fantastic rich man with- 
out frightening him away, he borrowed one day of the beadle his 
old frock, and the place where the old spy squatted every night 
droning out his orisons and playing the spy as he {ffayed, 

“Tire suspicious individual” did indeed come to Javert thus dis- 
guised, and gave him alms ; at that moment Javert raised his head, 
and the shock which Jean VaUeah seoehred. ddrikbig that he recog- 



^00 L E S M I S i K A B L E S 

siised Javert, Javert received, thinking that he recognised Jean VaU 

jean. 

However, the obscurity niiglU have decei\*ed him. the death ot 
Jean Valjean was ofikially cert i tied ; Javi*rt had siili serious doubts; 
and in case of doubt, javert, scrupult&gt;us as he was, never seized 
any man by the collar. 

He followed the old man to (lorlusau 1 ioust% and set *‘the old 
woman*’ talking, which was not at all ditticuh. 1 he tdd woman con- 
firmed the story of the coat lined with millions, and related to him 
the episode of the thousand- franc tit )t&lt;\ She liatl seen it! slie had 
touched it! Javert hired a room. 1'hat very night he insialletl him- 
self in it. He listened at the dtnir cu' the my?Uerinus ludgtag Imping 
to hear the souml of his voice, but Jean \ aljean iierceived his 
candle through the key-hole and l,&gt;aulked tiu* sj^y Iw keeping silence.

repeated in twenty papers, would have produced in Paris. "Yester- 
day, an old white-haired grandsire, a resp^table person living on 
his income, who was taking a walk with his grand-daughter, eight 
years old, was arrested and taken to the Station of the Prefecture 
as an escaped convict !” 

Let us say, in addition, that Javert had his own personal scruples ; 
the injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions o1 
the Prefect. He was really in doubt. 

Jean Valjean turned his back, and walked away in the darkness. 

Sadness, trouble, anxiety, weight of cares, this new sorrow of be- 
ing obliged to fly by night, and to seek a chance asylum in Paris for 
Cosette and himself, the necessity of adapting his pace to the pace 
of a child, all this, without his knowing it even, had changed Jean 
Valjean’s gait, and impressed upon his carriage such an appearance 
of old age that the police itself, incarnated in Javert, could be de- 
ceived. The impossibility of approaching too near, his dress of an 
old preceptor of the emigration, the declaration of Thenardier, who 
made him a grandfather ; finally, the belief in his death at the gal- 
leys, added yet more to the uncertainty which was increasing in 
Javert’s mind. 

For a moment he had an idea of asking him abruptly for his 
papers. But if the man were not Jean Valjean, and if the man were 
not a good old honest man of means, he was probably some sharper 
profoundly and skilfully adept in the obscure web of Parisian 
crime, some dangerous chief of bandits, giving alms to conceal his 
other talents, an old trick. He had comrades, accomplices, retreats 
on all hands, in which he would take refuge without doubt. All 
these windings which he was making in the streets seemed to indi- 
cate that he was not a simple honest man. To arrest him too soon 
would be "to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.” What incon- 
venience was there in waiting? Javert was very sure that he would 
not escape. 

He walked on, therefore, in some perplexity, questioning himself 
continually in r^ard to this mysterious personage. 

It was not until quite late, in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to 
the bright light which streamed from a bar-room, he decidedly 
recogni.sed Jean Valjean. 

There are in this world two beings who can be deeply thrilled : the 
mother, who finds her child, and the tiger, who finds his prey. Jav- 
ert felt this profound thrill. 

As soon as he had positively recognised Jean Valjean, the for- 
midable convict, he perceived that there were only three of them, 
and sent to the commissary of police, of the Rue de Pontoise, for 
additional aid. Before grasping a thorny stick, men put on glpves. 

This delay and stoppir^ at the RoUin square to arrange with his 
men made him lose the scent However, te had vj^ soon ^^s^ " *

that Jean Valjean's first wish would be to put tlie river between his 
pursuers and himself. He bowed his head and^ rctlccled, like a hound 
who put his nose to the ground to be sure of the way* Javert, with 
his straightforward power of instinct, went ilireetly to the bridge 
of Aiistci'litz. A word to the toll-keeiun* set him riglit, “Have you 
seen a man with a little girl r*’* “I made hini i)ay two stius,” answer- 
ed the tollman. Javert reached tlu^ l&gt;ridgi‘ in time to see Jean Val- 
jean on the other side of the river leacling i, across the space 
lighted by the moon. He saw him enter the Kue do (luanin Vert 
‘ Saint Antoine, he thought of the (.*iil-de-sac tienrot placed there 
like a trap, and of the only outlet from the Rue Drtiit Mur into the 
Fetite Kue Piepus. He put out heatt*rs, as hunters sriy ; lu: sent one

Javert would fain have uttered the same cry. 

His disappointment had a moment of _ despair and fury. 

It is certain that Napoleon blundered in the campaign in Russia, 
that Alexander blundered in the war in India, that Cffisar blundered 
in the African war, that Cyrus blundered in the war in Scythia, and 
that Javert blundered in this campaign against Jean Valjean. He did 
wrong perhaps in hesitating to recognise the old galley slave. The 
first glance should have been enough for him. He did wrong in not 
seizing him without ceremony in the old building. He did wrong in 
not arresting him when he positively recognised him in the Rue de 
Pontoise. He did wrong to hold a council with his aides, in full 
moonlight, in the Rollin square. Certainly advice is useful, and it is 
well to know and to question those of the dogs which are worthy 
of credit ; but the hunter cannot take too many precautions when 
he is chasing restless animals, like the wolf and the convict. Javert, 
by too much forethought in setting his bloodhounds on the' track, 
alarmed his prey by giving him wind of the pursuit, and allowed 
him the start. Pie did wrong, above all, when he had regained the 
scent at the bridge of Austerlitz, to play the formidable and puerile 
game of holding such a man at the end of a tliread. He thought him- 
self stronger than he was, and believed he could play mouse with 
a Hon. At the same time, he esteemed himself too weak when he 
deemed it necessary to obtain a reinforcement. Fatal precaution, 
loss of precious time. Javert made all these blunders, and yet he 
was none the less one of the wisest and most correct detectives that 
ever existed. He was, in the full force of the term, what in venery 
is called a gentle dog. But who is perfect ?, 

Great strategists have their eclipses. 

Great blunders are often made, like large ropes, of a multitude 
of fibres. Take the cable thread by thread, take separately all the 
little determining motives, you break them one after another, and 
you say : that is all. Wind them and twist them together they become 
an enormity ; Attila hesitating between Marcian in the East and 
Yalentinian in the West ; Plannibal delaying at Capua; Danton fall- 
ing to sleep at Arcis sur Aube. 

However this may be, even at the moment when he perceived that 
Jean, Valjean had escaped him, Javert did not lose his presence of 
mind. Sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be 
far away, he set watches, arranged traps and ambushes, and beat the 
quarter the night through. The first thing that he saw was the dis- 
placement of the lamp, the rope of which was cut. Precious indica- 
tion, which led him astray, however, by directing all his researches 
' towards the Cul-de-sac Genrot. There are in that cul-de-sac some 
rather low walls which face upon gardens the limits of which ex- 
tend to some very large uncultivated grounds. Jean Valjean evi- 
Idently must have fled that way. The fact is that, if he had pene-

trated into the Cul-dc-snc (jcnrot a little further, he would have 
done so, and would have been lost. J avert explored these gardens 
and these grounds, as if he were searehing for a needle. 

At daybreak, he left two intelligent men mt the watch, and re- 
turned to the Prefecture of i’olicc, crestfallen as a s[)y who has been 
caught by a thief. 



BOOK SIXTH— PETIT PICPUS 
I 

PETITE KUE PICPUS, NO. 62. 

Nothing resembleil more closely, half a century aso, the common- 
est porte-cochirc of the time than the porte-cochere of No. 62 
Petite Rue Fieptrs. 'I'his cloor wa.s usually half ojjcn in the most 
attractive manner, tlisdosinjj two thing.s which have nothinji very 
funereal about them — a court Humnuule&lt;l with walls bedecked with 
vines, and the face of a lounjqriuf' porter. Above the rear wall large 
trees could be seen. When a beam of .sunshine enlivened the court, 
when a gla.s.s of wine enlivened the porter, it was difficult to pass 
by No. 62 Petite Rue Ificpus, without carrying away a pleasant* 
idea. It was, however, a gloomy place of which you had had a 
glimpse. 

The door .smiled ; the house prayed and wept. 

If you succeedcil, which wa.s not easy, in pa.ssing the porter — 
which for almost everybody was even imi)o.ssihle, for there was an 
open sesame which you mu.st know; — if. having passed the porter, 
you entered on the right a little vc.stilnile which led to a .stairway 
shut in between two walls, and so narrow that hut one person could 
pass at a time ; if you did not allow younself to be frightened by the 
yellow wall paper with the chocolate surbase that extended along 
the stairs, if you ventured to go up, you passed by a first broad 
stair, then a second, and reached the second story in a hall where 
the yellow hue and the chocolate plinth followed you with a peace- 
ful persistency. Stairca.se and hall were lighted by two handsome 
windows. The hall made a sudden turn and became dark. If you 
doubled that caj&gt;e, you came, in a few steps, to a door, all the more 
mysterious that it was not quite closed. You pushed it open, an&lt;f 
found yourself in a little room about six feet souare, the floor tiled, 
scoured, neat and cold, and the walls hung witn fifteen-cent paper, 
nankeen-coloured paper with green flowers. A dull white light 
came from a large window with small panes which was at the left, 
and which took up the whole width of tihe room. You lodced, you 
saw no one; you listened, you heard no step and no human sound, 
The wall was bare ; the room had no furniture, not even a chair. 

You looked agiin, and you saw k the wtH opposite the door a 
quadrangular opening about a foot with a grate of 

40S 



406 L E S M I S fi K A U L E S 

iron bars crossing one another, black, kiiuitci!, soliii, which formed 
squares, I had almost said meshes, less than an inch acrciss. The 
little green flowers on the nankee|i paper came calmly and in order 
to these iron bars, without being frigliiened or scaitered by the dis- 
mal contact. In case any living being bad biaai sn inarvellouslv 
slender as to attemi)t to get in (»r nut tw the square luile, this grate 
would have prevented it. It did nut let the bndy pass, but it did'let 
the eyes pass, that i.s to .say, the mind. M liis seemed tu have been 
cared for, fur it had l&gt;een donbled by a sheet itf tin inserted in the 
wall a little behind it, and pierced with a tbuusiind Imles more micro- 
scopic than those of a skimmer. At the iHiitom dt this plate there 
was an opening cut ex.icliy like tht- nmiuh of a letier A piece 
of broad tape attached to .a bell hung at the right of the "rated 
opening. 

If you pulled this (ape, a ftell tinkled and ;i vtiice was heard, very 
near ytui, which startled you. ’ ^ 

"Who is there ?" .asked the voice. 

It was a woman's voice, a gentle voice, gentle that it wa‘ 
mournful. 

* Here again theta: was a iiiagic word which \on nuig know. If 
you did not know it, the voice was heard tut more, aitd the wall 
again hecame silent as if the wil.l itl.M'tiiiiy i&lt;i the sepulcltre had 
been on the oilier .side. 

If you knew the word, the voice atided ; 

“Itnler at the right." 

You then noticed at your right, opp,»-die tile wiiiflow, a glazed 
door .surniouiited iiy ,a gla/ed sash atul paitiled grey. N on lifted the 
latch, you passed through the door, and yon fe lt exactly the .same 
impression ns when yon enter a grateii t(.,x at the the.iire b; fore the 
grate is lowered am! llu* lights are lit. ^'ou were in fart in n sort of 
tluMtre bo.\. hartilv tnade visible by the dim Uglit ,,i the glass iloor, 
narrow, funtished with two old chairs and a jnece of tattered .straw 

etattiiig- a genuine box with its iront to lean int&gt;»tt, it|Hin wliich was 

' i of bkick I lii.s lwt\ luif tt ikmI 

of gilded wittitl as .it the Oiiera; it was a monstrous trellis of iron 
lKir.s frightftilly tangled together, and bolted to the wall bv enorm- 
ous bolts which resemldci! eienclied fnis. 

Alter a few minutes, when yonr eyes Iwgan to get aecttstoincd 
to tins caveriuHi.s light, ^oii tried to look ibtr.iigh the grate, hut 
Could not see more than six inches hevoiul. 1 berr you saw a barrier 
of blaek .shutters, .secured and sircnglheiied l.y woolen cross-liars 
pantled gingerbread colour. These Hhntiers were jointed, divided 
into long slender strips, .anti covered the whole lengili of the grate. 

1 hey were always closed. 

In a few monients, yon heard a voice ctilling lo you from behind 
these shutters and saying : ’ 



C O S E T T E 407 

“I am here. What do you want of me?” 

It was a loved voice, perhaps sometimes an adored one. You saw 
nobody. You hardly heard a breath. It seemed as if it were a. 
ghostly voice speaking to you across the portal of the tomb. 

If you appeared under certain necessary conditions, very rare, 
the narrow strip of one of these shutters opened in front of you, 
and the ghostly voice became an apparition. Behind the grate, be- 
hind the shutter, you perceived, as well as the grate permitted, a 
head, of which you saw only the mouth and chin; the rest was 
covered with a black veil. You caught a glimpse of a black guimp 
and an ill-defined form covered with a black shroud. This head 
spoke to you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you. 

The light which came from behind you was disposed in such wise 
that you saw her in the light, and she saw you in the shade. This 
light was symbolic. 

Meantime your eyes gazed eagerly, through this aperture thus 
opened, into this place closed against all observation. 

A deep obscurity enveloped this form thus clad in mourning. 
Your eyes strained into this ob.scurity, and souglit to distinguish 
what was about the apparition. In a little while you perceived that 
you saw nothing. What you saw was night, void, darkness, a wintry 
mist mingled with a sepulchral vapour, a sort of terrifying quiet, 9 . 
silence from which you distinguished nothing, not even sighs — 
shade in which you discerned nothihg, not even phantoms. 

What you saw was the interior of a cloister. 

It was the interior of that stern and gldomy house that was called 
the convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. This 
box where you were was the parlour. This voice, the first that spoke 
to you, was the voice of the portress, who was always seated, mo- 
tionless and silent, on the other side of the wall, near the square 
aperture, defended by the iron grate and the plate with the thousand 
holes, as by a double visor. 

The obscurity in which the grated box was sunk arose from this, 
that the locutory, which had a window on the side towards the out- 
side world, had none on the convent side. Profane eyes must see 
nothing of this .sacred place. 

There was something, however, beyond this shade, there was a 
light ; there was a life within this death. Although this convent was 
more inacce.ssiblc than any other, we shall endeavour to penetrate 
it, and to take the reader with us, and to relate, as fully as we may, 
something which story4:e!lers have never seen, and consequently 
have never related.

COSETTE ^ 409 

an entirely separate order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, 
whose cloisters were in the Rue Neuve Sainte Genevieve and at the 
i'emple. There were many differences in their rules, there were 
some in their costume. The Bernardine-Tenedictines of the Peti^ 
Picpus wore - black guimp, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sac- 
rament and of the Rue Neuve Sainte Genevieve wore a white one, 
and had moreover upon their breast a crucifix about three inches 
long in silver or copper gilt. The nuns of the Petit Picpus did not 
wear this crucifix. The devotion of the Perpetual Adoration, com- 
mon to the house of the Petit Picpus and to the house of the Tem- 
ple, left the two orders perfectly distinct. There is a similarity only 
in this respect between the I-adies of the Holy Sacrament and the 
Bernardines of Martin Verga, even as there is a similitude, in the 
study and the glorification of all the mysteries relative to the in- 
fancy, the life and the death of Jesus Christ, and to the Virgin, be- 
tween two orders widely separated and occasionally inimical ; the 
Oratory of Italy, established at Florence b}'' Philip cli Neri, and the 
Oratory of I'rancc. established at Paris by Pierre de Bcriille. The 
Oratory of Paris claims the precedence, I'hilip di Neri being only 
a saint, and Berulle being a cardinal. 

I.et us return to the severe Spanish rules of Martin Verga. 

The Bernardine-Bcnedictines of this Obedience abstain from 
meat all the year round, fast during Lent and many other days pe- 
culiar to them, rise out of their first sleep at one okdock in the 
morning to read their breviary and chant matins until three, sleep 
in coarse woollen sheets at all seasons and upon straw, use no baths, 
never light any fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the 
rule of silence, speak to one another only at recreations, which are 
very short, and wear hairclotli chemises for six months, from the 
fourteenth of September, the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until 
Easter. These six months are a moderation — the rttles say all the 
year ; l)ut tins haircloth chemise, insupportable in the heat of sum- 
mer, produced fevers and nervous spasms. It became necessary to 
limit its use. Even with this mitigation, after the fourteenth of 
September, when the nuns ptJt on this chemise, they have three or 
four days of fever. Obedience, poverty, chastity, continuance in 
cloister; such are their vows, rendered much more difficult of ful- 
filment by the niles. 

The i)rit)ress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are 
called twal mothers, because they have a voice in the chapter. A 
prioress can be re-elected but twice, which fixes the longest possible 
a*eign of a prioress at nine years. 

They never see the officiating pnest, who is always concealed 
from them by a woollen curtain nine feet high. During sermon, 

; when the preaclier is in the chapel, they droj) their veil over their 
f face; they must always speak low» walk with their eyes on the

They never say my or mine. They have nothing of their own, and 
imust cherish nothing. They say our of everything ; thus : our veil, 
our chaplet; if they speak of their chemise, they say our chemise. 
Sometimes they become attached to some little object, to a prayei-- 
book, a relic, or a sacred medal. As soon as they perceive that they 
■are beginning to cherish this object, they must give it up. They re- 
member the reply of Saint Theresa, to whom a great lady, at the 
moment of entering her order, said : permit me, mother, to send 
' for a holy Bible which I cherish very much. “Ah ! you cherish some- 
thing! In that case, do not enter our house!’ 

None are allowed to shut themselves up, and to liave a home, a 
room. They live in open cells. When they meet one another, one 
says: Praise and adoration to the most holy sacrament of the altar! 
The. other responds : Forever. The same ceremony when one knocka 
at another’s door. Hardly is the door touched when a gentle voice 
is heard from the other side hastily saying, Forever. Like all ritu- 
als, this becomes mechanical from habit; and one sometimes says 
forever before the other has had time to say, what is indeed rather 
lengthy, Praise and adoration to the most holy sacrament of the 
altar! 

Among the Visitandines, the one who comes in says : Ave Marian 
and the one to whose cell she comes says : Gratia plena. This is 
their good day, which is, in fact, "graceful.” 

At each hour of the day, three supplementary strokes sound from 
: the bell of the convent church. At this signal, prioress, mothers, 
'professed nuns, sister servants, novices, postulants, all break off 
i from what they are saying, doing, or thinking, and say at once, if 
It is five o’clock, for example : At five o’clock and at all times, praise 
md adoration to the most holy sacrament of the altar! If it is 
' dght o’clock ; At eight and at all times, etc., and so on, according 
E to whatever hour it may be. 

This custom, which is intended to interrupt the thoughts^ and to 
iiead them back constantly to God, exists in many; communities ; the 
[formula only, varies. Thus, at the Infant Jesus,' they say: At the 
Ipresent hour and at all hours may the love of Jesus enkindle my 
iimart! 

The Benedictine-Beniardines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty 
fears ago in' the Petit Piepus, clmnt the offices in a grave psalmody, 
fcre plain-chant, and always in a loud voice for the_ whole duration, 
pi the office. Wherever there is an asterisk in the missal, they make 
fc ‘pause and say in a low tone : Jesus — Mary — Joseph. For the office 
the dead, they ttdee so low a pitch, that it is difficult for female 
Kces to reach it. The effect is thrilling and tragical. 

KThose of the Petit Piepus had had a vault made under their high 
Har for the burial of their community. The government, as they 
W it, does not oermit coroscs to be deposited in this vault. They 



'412 lesmisiIeables 

therefore were taken from the convent when they died. This was 

an affliction to them, and horrified them as if it were a violation. 

They had obtained — small consolation — the privilege of being 
buried at a special hoitr and in a special place in the old Vaugirard 
Cemetery, which was located in ground formerly 1)elonging to the 
community. 

On Thursday these nuns heard high mass, vespers, and all the 
offices the same as on Sunday. They moreover scru])nl&lt;msly ob- 
served all the little feast days, unknown fi&gt; the ])eo]ile of the world, 
of which the church was formerly lavish in l''rance, and is still 
lavish in Spain and Italy. Their attendance at chapel is interminable. 
As to the number and duration of their jirayers, we cannot give a 
better idea than by quoting the frank words of one tif themselves; 
The prayers of ihe postulants arc friuhiful, the prayers of .the 
novkes'worse, and the prayers of the professed nuns still morse. 

Once a week the chapter assembles; the prioress presides, the 
mothers attend. Each sister conies in her turn, kneels upon the 
stone, and confesses aloud, before all. the faults and sins which she 
has committed during the week. 'I'he mothers consult together after 
each confession, and announce the penalty aloud. 

In addition to o])cn confession, for which they reserve all .serious 
faults, they have for venial faults what they call the enulpe. To per- 
form the coulpe is to [irostrate yourself on your face during the 
office, before the prioress until site, who is never si&gt;okcn of except 
as onr mother, indicates to the .sufferer, liy a gentle rap uixin the 
side of her stall, that she may rise. The couliie is performed for 
very petty things ; a glass brokcti. a veil torn, an involuntary delay 
of a few seconds at an office, a fal.se note in church, etc., — ^these are 
enough for the coulpe. The coul|)e is entirely spnntaneons; it is the 
culpable herself (this word is here elymnlogically in its place) who 
judges herself and who inflicts it ui)on herself. On feast-days and 
Sunda)^s there arc four chorister jnoiliers who sing the offices be- 
fore a large desk with four music .stands. One day a inutlier choris- 
ter intoned a p.salm which comtnena;*! by Eee'e, and, instead of 
Ecce, she pronounced in a loud voice these three notes : nt, si, sol; 
for this absence of mind she underwent a coulpe which lasted 
through the whole office. Wliat renderetl tin* fault pcctiliarly enor- 
-inous was, that the chapter laughetl. 

When a mm is called to the iocntory, he it even the prioress, she 
drops her veil, it will be rememhered, in such a way ;i.s to show 
nothing but her mouth. 

*The prioress alone can communicate with strangers. The others 
can see only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If by 
chance persons from without present themselves to see a nun whom 
they have known or loved in tite world, a fnrmftl negotiation is 
necessary. If it be a woman, permission may be sometimes accord- 



COSETTE 413 

ed ; the nun comes and is spoken to through the shutters, which are 
never opened except for a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to 
say that permission is always refused to men. 

Such are the rules of St. Benedict, rendered more severe by 
Martin Verga. 

These nuns are not joyous, rosy, and cheerful, as are often the 
daughters of other orders. They are pale and serious. Between 1825 
and 1830 three became insane. 


Ill 

SEVERITIES 

A POSTULANCY of at least two years is required, often four; a 
novitiate of four years. It is rare that the final vows can be pro- 
nounced under twenty-three or twenty-four years. The Bernardine- 
Benedictines of Martin Verga admit no widows into their order. 

They subject themselves in their cells to many unknown self- 
mortifications of which they must never speak. 

The day on which a novice malces her profession she is dressed 
in her finest attire, with her head decked with white roses, and her 
hair glossy and curled ; then she prostrates herself ; a great black 
veil is spread over her, and the office for the dead is chanted. The 
nuns then divide into two files, one file passes near her, saying in 
plaintive accents : Our sister is dead, and the other file responds

At the period to which this history relates, a boarding-school 
"was attached to the convent. A school of noble young girls, for the 
most part rich, among whom were noticeable Mesdemoiselles De 
|,Sainte Aulaire and De Bclissen, and an English girl bearing the 
illustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by 
|||biesc nuns between four walls, grew up in horror of the world and 
iof the age. One of them said to us one day: to see the pavement of 
street made me shiver from head to foot. They were dressed 
m blue with a white cap, and a Holy Spirit, in silver or copper gilt, 
Mjon their breast. On certain grand feast-days, particularly on St. 
Martha’s day, they were allowed, as a high favour and a supreme 
»asure, to dress as nuns and perform the offices and the ritual of 
Benedict for a whole day. At first the professed nuns lent them 
^^ir black garments. That appeared profane, and the prioress for- 
it. This loan was permitted only to novices. It is remarkable 
l^t these representations, undoubtedly tolerated and encouraged 
Kthe convent by a secret spirit of proselytism, and to give these 
Hpdren some foretaste of the holy dress, were a real pleasure and 
^gtouine recreation for the scholars. They simply amused them-

The pupils, austerities excelled, conformed to all the ritual of 
the convent. There are young women who, returned to the world, 
and after several years of marriage, have not yet sneeeeded in break- 
ing off the Inibit i&gt;f saying hastily, whenever there is a knock at the 
door: Fom'cr! Like the nuns, the boarders saw their relatives only 
in the locutory. liven their mothers were not permitted to embrace 
them. Strictness upon ibis jniint was curried to the following e.x- 
tent ; One. day a young girl was visited by lier utoiber ai'i-,,iupanicd 
bya little sister three years obi. 'ITie young girl wept, tor she wished 
very much to kiss her sister. Impossible. She l&lt;e:‘,i;t'd tlmt the child

that she might kis.s it. This was ret'usetl almusl with indignation.

health, murmurs, cries, upi-oar, pleasure and happiness, to smooth 
the wrinkles from off all grandames, those of the epic as well as 
the tale, those of the throne as well as the hut, from Hecuba to 
Mother Goose. 

In this house, more than anywhere else, perhaps, have been heard 
these children’s sayings, which have so much grace, and which 
make one laugh with a laugh full of thought. It was within these 
four forbidding walls that a child of five years e.xclaimed one day : 
“Mother, a great girl has just told me that 1 have only nine years 
and ten months more to stay here, Hozv glad I am!” 

Here, also, that this memorable dialogue occurred: 

A Motheu. — ^"W hat are you crying for, my child?” 

The Ciiri.» (six years old), .sohbing.---“I told Alice I knew my 
French history. She .say.s I don’t know it, and I do know it.” 

Alice, larger (nine years). — ^“No, she dae.sn’t know it.” 

The Mother. — ^“ llow is that, my child?” 

AucE.---‘'Shc told me to ojjen the Ixjok anywhere and ask her 
any question there wa.s in the hook, and she could answer it.” 

“Well ?” 

"She didn’t answer it.” 

“Let us see. What did you ask her?” 

“I oiiened the hook anywhere, just as she said, and I asked her 
the first question I found.” 

“And what was the question ?” 

“It was ; IVhat hal*p(med next?” 

Here this profound observation was made about a rather dainty 
parrot, which belonged to a lady hmrder : 

“Isn't she genteel! she pichs off the top of her tart, like a lady,” 

From one of the tiles of the cloister, the following confession 
was picked up, written he forehand, so as not to be forgotten, by 
a little sinner seven years oUl. 

“J'ather, 1 accuse myself of having lieen avaricious. 

“I'ather, I accuse myself of having been adulterous. 

“Father, 1 accuse myself of having raised my eyes toward? the 
gentlemen.” * 

Upon one of the grassy hanks of this garden, the following 
story was improvised hv a rosy mouth six years old, and listened 
to by blue eyes four and five years old : ^ 

“There were three little chickens who lived in a country where 
there were a good many flowers. Thqr picked the flowers and 
put them in their pockets. After that, they picked the leaves, atra 
they put them in their playthings. There was a ivolf in the country, 
and there was a good many wewds ;and the wolf was in the woods; 
and he ate up the little chickens." 

And again, this Qth«Er poem: 

“Th«« was a blow with a JNkilr. 



416 LES MIsfiRAULES 

“It was Punchinello who struck the cat, 

“That didn’t do him any good ; it did her harm. 

“Then a lady put Punchinello in prison.” 

There, also, these sweet and heartrending words were .said bv a 
little foundling that the convent was rearing tlironglr cliarity. She 
heard the others talking about their mothers, and she murmured in 
her little place : 

“For tny part, my mother was not there when 7 rcu-y barn.” 

There was a fat portress, who was always to lie stien hurrying 
about the corridors with her bunch of kc-ys, .and wlittse name was 
Sister Agatha. The great big girls, — over ten, calkal her Agathocks. 

The refectory, a large oblong room, which received light only 
■from a cloister window with a tinted arch opeiiing on a level with 
the garden, was dark and damp, and, as the children said— full of 
beasts. All the surrounding places furnished it their contingents of 
insects. Each of its four corner.s had received in th&lt;f language of 
the pupils, a peculiar and expressive name. Thtm- was the Spiders' 
corner, the Caterpillars’ corner, tlu; Woodlice’s corner, and the 
Crickets’ corner. The crickets’ corner was near the kitchen, and 
was highly esteemed. It was not so cold ,as the others. I'rnm the re- 
fectory the names had passed to the school-room, and servis! to dis- 
tinguish there, as at the old Itlazarin College, four nations. Each 
pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner 
of the refectory in which she .sat .at meals. One diiy, tlte archbishop, 
making his pastoral visit, .saw enter the class which lie was |_ias.sing, 
a pretty little blii.shing girl with beautiful fair hair; and he a.sked 
another scholar, a charming fresli-cheeked brunette, who was near 
him: . 

“WTiat is this little girl ?” 

“She is a spider, monseigneur.” 

“P-shaw 1 — and this other one ?” 

“She is a cricket.” 

“And that one?” 

“She is a caterpillar.” 

“Indeed! And what are you?” 

“I am a wood-louse, monseigneur.” 

Every house of this kind has its peculiarities. At the commence- 
ment of this century, Ecouen was one of those serene and graceful 
places where, in a shade which wfis almost august, the cliildlKKid of 
yovaig girls was passed. At Ecouen. l&gt;y way of rank in the proces- 
sion of the Holy Sacrament, they made a’ distinct ion bet ween the 
yirgitts and the florists. There were also “the canopies," and the 
“censers,” the former carrying the cords of the canopy, tlie latter 
swinging censers before the Holy Sacrament. The flowers returned 
of right to the florists. Four “virgins” walked at the Ijead of the 



COSETTE 417 

procession. On the morning of the great day, it was not uncommon 
to hear the question in the dormitory. 

“Who is a virgin ?” ■ 

Madame Campan relates this' saying of a “little girl” seven 
years old to a “great girl” of sixteen who took the head of the pro-- 
cession, while she, the little one, remained in tlie rear. “You’re a 
virgin, you are ; but I am not.”

DISTRACTIONS 

Above the door of the refectory was written in large black letters 
this prayer, which was called the white Paternoster, and which pos- 
sessed the virtue of leading people straight in to Paradise : 

“Little white paternoster, which God made, which God said, 
which God laid in Paradise. At night, on going to bed, I finded(j!V) 
three angels lying on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the 
good Virgin Mary in the middle, who to me said that I should went 
. to bed, and nothing suspected. The good God is my father, the Holy 
Virgin is my mother, the three apostles are my brothers, the three 
virgins are my sisters. The chemise in which God was born, my 
body is enveloped in; the cross of Saint Marguerite on my breast 
is writ ; Madame the Virgin goes away through the fields, weeping 
for God, meeted Monsieur Saint John. Monsieur Saint John, where 
do you come from? I come from Ave Solus. You have not seen- the 
good God, have you? He is on the tree of the cross, his feet hangr 
ing, his hands nailing, a little hat of white thorns upon his head. 
Whoever shall say this three times at night, three times in the morn- 
ing, will win Paradise in the end,” 

In 1827, this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall 
under a triple layer of paper. It is fading away to this hour in the: 
memory of some young girls of that day, old ladies -now. 

A large crucifix hanging upon the wall completed the decoration 
of this refectory, the only door of which, as we believe we have said, 
opened upon the garden. Two narrow tables, at the sides of each of 
which were two wooden benches, extended along the refectory in 
parallel lines from one end to the other. The walls were white, and 
the tables black ; these two mourning colours are the only variety in 
.donvents; The meals were coarse, and the diet of even the children 
;^trict. A single plate, meat and vegetables together, or salt fish, con- 
•stituted the fare. This brief bill of fare was, however, an excep- 
tion, reserved for the scholars alone. The childreri ate in sileiice, 
|tmder the watchful eyes of the mother for the week, who, from time 
io time* if a fly ventured to hftm or to bufe oontf ary to rule, noisily 
ppened and shut a wooden book. This silence was seasoned with the

the archbishop had spoken. A scandal to the convent, but a joyful 
thing for the school. Imagine the effect. 

Tliis rigid cloister was not, howevei-, so well walled in, that the 
life of the passions of the outside world, that drama, that romance 
even, did not penetrate it. To prove this, we will merely state briefly 
an actual, incontestable fact, which, however, has in itself no re- 
lation to our story, not being attached to it even by a thread. We 
mention this merely to complete the picture of the convent in the 
mind of the reader. 

There was about that time, then, in the convent, a mysterious 
person, not a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who 
was called Madame Albertina. Nothing was known of her, except 
that she was insane, and that in the world she was supposed to be 
dead. There were, it was said, involved in her story, some pecuniary 
arrangements necessary for a great marriage. 

This woman, Imrdly thirty years old, a beautiful brunette, stared 
wildly with her lai'ge black eyes. Was she looking at anything? It 
was doubtful. She glided along rather than walked; she never 
spoke ; it was not quite certain that she breathed. Her nostrils were 
as thin and livid as if she had heaved her last sigh. To touch her 
hand was like touching snow. She had a strange spectral grace. 
Wherever she came, all were cold. One day, a sister seeing her 
pass, said to another, "She passes for dead.” “Perhaps she is,” an- 
swered the other. 

Many stories were told about Madame Albertine. She was the 
eternal subject of curiosity of the boarders. There was in the chapel 
a gallery, which was called I’Qlil-de-Bocuf. In this gallery, which 
had only a circular opening, an ccil-de-bceuf, Madame Albertine at- 
tended the ofBccs. She was usually alone there, because from this 
gallery, which was elevated, the preacher or the officiating priest 
could be seen, which was forbidden to the nuns. One day, the pulpit 
was occupied by a young priest of high rank, the Duke de Rohan, , 
peer of France, who was an officer of the Mousquetaires Rouges in 
1815, when he was Prince de L6on, and who died afterwards in 
1^0, a cardinal, and Archbishop of Besamjon. This was the first 
time that M, de Rohan had preached in the convent of the Petit 
Piepus. Madame Albertine ordinarily attended the sermons and the 
offices with perfect calmness and complete silence. On that day, as 
soon as .she saw M. d.e Rohan, she half rose, and, in all the stillness 
of the chapel, exclaimed: ‘What? Auguste?” The whole commun- 
ity were astounded, and turned their heads ; the_ preacher raised his 
eyes, but Madame Albertine had fallen back into her motionless 
suence. A breath from the world- without, a glimmer of life, had. 
passed for a moment over that dead and icy fonn, then all lad van- 
ished, and the lunatic had again become a corpse. 

These two words, however, set. everybody in the convent who

so familiarly; and that she had some conneciion with him, of rela- 
tionship perhaps, but beyond all doubt very intimate, since she knew 
his *'pet name.*' 

Two very severe duchesses, Mesdanics dt‘ Clioiscatl and de 
Scrent, often visited the cominunily, to which they don])tk*ss were 
admitted by virtue of the privilege of Mtiijuaii's jutilirnw', greatly 
to the terror of the school. When the two old ladies pai.sed, all the 
poor young girls trciiihled and lowered tludr eyes. 

M. dc Rohan was, niorco.ver, without kntiwing it, tlie object of 
the attention of the school-girls. 11c liad just at that time been

curls, and a large girdle of magniruamt name, while his hlaek cas- 
sock was of the most elegant cut in the workl. All these girlish im- 
aginations were very much occujiied with him. 

No sound from without penetrated the camvent. 1'here was, how- 
ever, one year when the sound of a flute was heard, 'rids was an 
event, and the pupils of the time reniemher it yc*t. 

It wasaflnte on which somehody in the neighhoinliood was inlay-

gotten: My Zctulba, come rdijn acr my soul, and tluw heard it 
two or three times a day. The young girls passed hours in listt^ning,

upon the flute in his garret to while away the time. 


VI 

THE LITTLE CONVENT 

There were in this inclosure of the Petit Picpus three perfectly 
distinct buildings, the Great Convent, in which the nuns lived, the 
school building, in which the pupils lodged, and finally what was 
called the Little Convent, This was a detached building with a 
garden, in which dwelt in common many old nuns of various orders, 
remnants of cloisters destroyed by the revolution ; a gathering of 
all shades, black, grey, and white, from all the communities and of 
all the varieties possible ; what might be called, if such a coupling of 
names were not disrespectful, a sort of motley convent. 

From the time of the empire, all these poor scattered and deso- 
late maidens had been permitted to take shelter under the wings of 
the Benedictine-Bernardines. The government made them a small 
allowance ; the ladies of the Petit Picpus had received them with 
eagerness. It was a grotesque mixture. Each followed her own rules. 
The school-girls were sometimes permitted, as a great recreation, 
to make them a visit ; so that these young memories have retained 
among others a reniinisence of holy Mother Bazile, of holy Mother 
Scholastique, and of Mother Jacob. 

One of these refugees found herself again almost in her own 
home. She was a nun of Sainte Aure, the only one of her order who 
survived. The ancient convent of the Ladies of Sainte Aure occu- 
pied at the beginning of the'aghteenth century this same house of 
the Petit Picpus which afterwards belonged to the Benedictines of 
Martin Verga. This holy maiden, too poor to wear the magnificent 
dress of her order, which was a white robe with a scarlet scapular, 
had piously clothed a little image with it, which she showed com- 
placently, and which at her death she bequeathed to the house. In 
1824, there remained of this order only one nun; to-day there 
remains only a doll. ' ’ 

In addition to these worthy mothers, a few old women of fashion 
had obtained permission of the prioress, as had Madame Albertinr, 
to retire into the Little Convent. Among the number were Madame 
de Beaufort, d'Hautpoul, and Madame la Marquise Dufresne. 
Another was known in the convent only by the horrible noise she 
made in blowing her nose. The pupils called her Racketini. 

About 1820or 4S21, Madame de Genlis, who at that time was 
editing a little jmagazine^ Iftfr€pide, zsked permission to 

occupy ^ rooiBi' at: the oonv^t of. the Pw Picpus. Monsieur the 



422 L E S MISER A U 1. K S 

Duke of Orleans rccommcmled her. A huzzinj' in tlu; hive ; the 
mothers were all in a tremor; Madame de (ienlis had written 
romances ; but she declared that she was the first to tieicst them, and 
then she had arrived at her phase of fierce devotion, flod aiding, 
and the prince also, she entered. 

She went avvtiy at the end of six or eight niontlis, saving as a 
reason tliat the garden had no sluule. The nuns were in raptures. 
Although very old, she still played on the harp, am! tlial very well. 

On going away, she left her mark fni her eeli. Matiame i!e lienlis 
was superstitious and foml of Latin. These two tenns give a very 
good outline of her. There could still he .seen a few years ago. pasted

virtue of frightening away thieves:

These lines in Latin of tlii' Sixth i Viilnrv, rai-e the iiiiestinn as 
to whether tlu- names of tlu- two thieves of I alvai v were, as is com-

rules commanded silence, the public was advised of their presence 
only by the sound of the rising and falling stall-seats.

A FEW OUTLINES IN THIS SHADE 

During the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress 
of the Petit Picpus was Mademoiselle De Blemeur, whose religious 
name was Mother Innocent. She was of the family of Marguerite 
De Blemeur, author of the Lives of the Saints of the Order of St. 
Benedict. She had been re-elected. A woman of about sixty, short, 
fat, “chanting like a cracked kettle,” says the letter from which we 
have already quoted ; but an excellent woman, the only one who was 
cheerful in the whole convent, and on that account adored. 

Mother Innocent resembled her ancestor Marguerite, the Daciet 
of the Order. She was well-read, erudite, learned, skilful, curious, 
in histoiy, stuffed with Latin, crammed with Greek, full of He- 
brew, and rather a monk than a nun. 

The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun almost blind, Mother 
Cineres. 

The most esteemed among the mothers were Mother Sainte 
Honorine, the treasurer, Mother Sainte Gertrude, first mistress of 
the novices, Mother Sainte Ange, second mistress. Mother Annun- 
ciation, sacristan. Mother Sainte Augustin, nurse, the only nun in 
the convent who was ill-natured ; then Mother Sainte Mechthilde 
(Mile. Gauvain), quite young and having a wonderful voice; 
Mother Des Anges (Mile. Drouet), who had been in the convent 
of the Filles-Dieu and in the convent of the Tresor, between Gisors 
and Magny; Mother Sainte Joseph (Mile, de Cogolludo), Mother 
Sainte Adelaide (Mile. D’Auverney), Mother Mercy (Mile, de 
Cifuentes), who could not endure the austerities. Mother Com- 
passion (Mile. De la Miltiere, received at sixty in spite of the rules, 
very rich); Mother Providence (Mile, de Laudiniere),_ Mother 
Presentation (Mile, de Siguenza), who was prioress in 1847; 
finally, Mother Sainte Celigne (sister of the sculptor Ceracchi), 
since insane, Mother Sainte Chantal (Mile, de Suzon), since insane. 

There was still among the prettiest a charming girl of twenty- 
three, from the Isle of Bourbon, a descendant of the Chevalier 
Roze, who was called in the world Mademoiselle Roze, and who 
called herself Mother Assumption. A . . j 

Mother Sainte Mechthilde, who had charge of the singing rad 
the choir, gladly availed herself of the pupils. She usually took a 
complete gamut of them, that is to say, seven, from ten years old 
to sixteen inclusive/ of gntdiiatoi toiexs Mid stature, and had them

sing, standing in a row, ranged according to their age frtini the 
smallest to the largest. This presented to tlu*. sight soniething like 
a harp of young girls, a sort of living pipe of Ian inade. of angels. 

Those of the servant sisters whom the pigiils liktMl l.&gt;est were 
Sister Sainte Euphrasie, Sister Sainte M:irgiteritt\ Sister Sainte 
Marthc, who was in her dotage, and Sister Sainte .Michael, whose 
long nose made them laugh. 

All these women were gentle to all these children. 1'he luins were 
severe only to themselves. The only were in the schi»oI build- 
ing, and the fare, compared with that ot the convent, was choice. 
Besides that, they received a thmisand little attentions. Only when 
a child passed near a nun and spoke to her, the nun never answered. 

This rule of silence had had this viUxl tint, in \\w wliole convent,

filled the large trapezium which was formed by the intersection of 
the Rue Polonceau, the Rue Droit Mur, the Petite Rue Picpiis, and 
the built-up alley called in the old plans Rue Aumarais. These'four 
streets surrounded this trapezium like a ditch. The convent was 
composed of several buildings and a garden. The principal build- 
ing, taken as a wliole, was an aggregation of Iwbrid constructions 
which, in a bird’s-eye view, presented with considerable accuracy the 
form of a gil)l)et laid down on the ground. 

The long arm of the gibbet extended along the whole portion of 
the Rue Droit Mur comprised betw^een the Petite Rue Piepus and 
the Rue Polonccau ; the short arm was a high, grey, severe, grated 
facade which overlooked the Petite Rue Piepus"; the porlc cochcre, 
No. 62, marked the end of it. Towards the middle of this f agade, ^ 
the dust and aslies had whitened, an old low-arched door where the 
spiders made their wel:)S, and which was opened onlv for an hour or 
two on Sunday and on the rare occasions when the corpse of a nun 
was taken out of the convc'nt. it was the public entrance of the 
church. The cll)ow of the gibl.)et was a square hall which served as 
pantry, and wdiich the nuns called the expense. In the long arm 
where the cells of the mothers, sisters and novices. In the short arm 
were the kitchens, the refectory, lined wdth cells, and the church. 
Between the door, No. 62, and the corner of the closed alley 
Aumarais, was tlie school, wdiich could not be seen from the out- 
side. The rest of tlie trajiczium formed the garden, which was much 
lower than the level of tlie I'^uc Polonceau. so that the walls were 
considerahly higher on the inside than on the outside. The garden, 
which was sHghlly convex, had in tlic centre, on the top of a knoll, 
a beautiful fir, pointed and conical, from wliich parted, as from the 
centre of a luickku*, four broad walks, and, arranged two by two be- 
tween the lu’oad walks, eight narrow ones, so that, if the inclosure 
had been circular, the geometrical plan of the walks would have 
resemliled a cross placed over a wheel. The walks, all extending to 
the very irre\gular walls of the garden, were of unequal length. They 
were l)or(U‘rt‘tl with gooseberry bushes. At the further end of the 
garden a row of large j.&gt; 0 }.)lars extended from the ruins of the old 
convent, wliicli was at the corner of the Rue Droit Mur, to the 
house of the Tittle Convent, which was at the corner of the alley 
Aumarais. Ikdore the Little Convent, was what was called the Little 
Garden. Add to tins outline a courtyard,. all manner of angles made 
by detached buihlings, prison walls, no prospect and no neighbour- 
hood, but the lung black line of roofs which ran along the other 
side of the fine Polonceau, and you can form a complete image of 
what was, forty-five years ago, the house of the Bernardines of 
the Petit Piepus. This holy house had been built on the exact site of 
a famous tennis-court, which existed from the fourteenth to the 



426 L E S M I S ft K A It L K S 

sixteenth century, and which was calUsl ihe court of the eleven 

thousand devils. 

All these streets, moreover, were anuniK the most ancient in 
Paris. These names, Droit Mur and Aumaruis are very old; the 
streets which bcjit thciu urc luiich tinlci still* I he alli*} Atnnarais 
was called the alley MauKout ; the Hue l)ioit Mur was called the 
Rue des Eglantiers, for God oi'cned the ilowers be lure man cut

A CKNTl;UY UNOKK A OtUMl’ 

Since wc are dealing with the details of what w.ns inrmcrly the 
convent of the Petit i'icinis, and have dared to open a window upon 
that secluded asylum, the reader will pardon ns .•mother little iligres- 
.sion, foreign tu’the ohjeel of this honk, hut charaeleriMic and usc'

Tliere was in the l.ittle t-’onveiit a ceiitemoian who came from 
the Abbey of lumtevrauU- Hefore tin- revedmion &gt;l(e had even been

the Abbey of IStiitcvrauIl. ibitt i: w.i.' like a eiiy, and iluit there were 
streets within the convetil. 

She spoke witli a Picardy accent which ddigliied the pupils. 
Every year she .solemnly renewed her vow\, and, at the moiiient of 
takin'g llie otilh, .she wonM sity to the priest: .Mon&gt;eignenr St. 
Pnuicis gave it to Moiiseigneur Hi. Julian, .Mon .eigiietir .St. Julian

their veils, joyous little stilled laughs which made the mothers

four silver gohkis in which were four didfei'eiit wines. I jion tte

brutalises- 

She had in a closet, under key, a mysterious object, which she 
cherished very highly. The rules of Fontevrault did not prohibit it. 
She would not show this object to anybody. She shut herself up, 
which her rules permitted, and hid herself whenever she wished to 
look at it. If she heard a step in the hall, she shut the closet as quick 
as she could with her old hands. As soon as anybody spoke to her 
about this, she was silent, although she was so fond of talking. The 
most curious were foiled by her silence, and the most perservering 
by her obstinacy. This also was a subject of comment for all who 
were idle or listless in the convent. What then could this thing be, 
so secret and so precious, which was the treasure of the centenarian ? 
Doubtless, some sacred book, or some unique chaplet? or some 
proven relic? They lost themselves in conjecture. On the death of 
the poor old woman they I'an to the closet sooner, perhaps, than was 
seemly, and opened it. The object of their curiosity was found under 
triple cloths, like a blessed patine. It was a Faenza plate, represent- 
ing Loves in flight, pursued by apothecaries’ boys, armed with enor- 
mous syringes. The pursuit is full of grimaces and comic postures. 
One of the charming little Loves is ^ready spitted. He struggles, 
shakes his little wings, and still tries to fly away, but the lad caper- 
ing about, laugdis with a Satanic laughter. Moral : — love conquered 
by cholic. This plate, ^ veiy curious, moreover, and which had the 
honour, perhaps, of giving an idea to Moliere, was still in existence 
in September, 1845; it was for sale in a second-hand store in the 
Boulevard Beaumarchais. 

This good old woman would receive no visit from the outside 
world, because, said she, the locutory is too gloomy. 


X 

ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION 

That almost sepulchral locutory, of which we have endeavoured 
to give an idea, is an entirely local feature, which is not reproduced 
with the same severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue 
du Temple in particular, which, indeed, was of another order, the 
black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the locutory 
itself was a nicely floored parlour, the windows of which were 
draped with white muslin, while the walls admitted a variety of 
pictures, a portrait of a Benedictine nun, with uncovered face, 
flower-pieces, and even a Turk’s head. 

It was in the garden of the convent of the Rue du Temple, that 
that horse-chestnut tree stood, which passed for the most beautiful

XI 

END OF THE PETIT PICPUS 

From the time of the restoration, the convent of the Petit Picpus 
had been dwindling- away; this was a portion of the general death 
of the order, which, since the eighteenth century, has been going the 
way of all religions orders. Meditation is, as well as prayer, a ne- 
cessity of humanity ; but, like everything which the revolution has 
touched, it will transform itself, and, from being hostile to social 
progress, will become favourable to it. 

The house of the Petit Picpus dwindled rapidly. In 1840, the 
little convent had disappeared; the school had disappeared. There 
were no longer either the old women, or the young girls ; the 
former were dead, the latter had gone away. Volazrenmt, 

The rules of tlie Perpetual Adoration are so rigid that they in- 
spire dismay ; inclinations recoil, the order gets no recruits. In 1845, 
it still gathered here and there a few sister servants; but no nuns 
of the choir. Forty years ago there were nearly a hundred nuns, 
fifteen years ago there were only twenty-eight. How many are there 
to-day? In 1847 the prioress was young, a sign that the oppor- 
tunity for choice was limited. She was not forty. As the number 
diminishes the fatigue increases ; the service of each becomes more 
difficult, thenceforth they saw the moment approaching when there 
should be only a doxen sorrowful and bowed shoulders to bear the 
hard rules of Saint Benedict. The burden is inflexible, and remains 
the same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. 
Thus they died. Since the author of this book lived in Paris, two 
have died. One was twenty-five, the other twenty-three. The latter 
might say with Julia Alpinula : Hie jaceo, minos virjinii et tres. 
It "was on account of this decay that the convent abandoned the 
education of girls. 

Wc could not pass by this extraordinary, unknown, obscure 
house without entering and leading in those who accompany us, 
and who listen as we relate, for the benefit of some, perhaps, the 
melanclioly liistory of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into that 
community full (^f its old practices which seem so novel to-day. It 
is tile closed garden. liorfus couclusus. We have spoken of this 
singular place with mituiteness, liiit with respect, as much at least 
as res])ecl and minuteness are reconcilable. We do not comprehend 
everything, but we insult nothing. We arc equally distant from the 
hosannalis of Josciih De Maistre. who goes so far as to sanctify the 
executioner, and the mockery of Voltaire, who goes so far as to 
rail at the crucifix. * 

Illogicalness of Voltaire, be it said by the way ; for Voltaire 
would have defended Jesus a.s he defended Calas; and, for those

BOOK SEVEN— A PARENTHESIS 

I 

THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA 

This book is a drama the first character of which is the Infinite. 

Man is the second. 

This lieing the case, when a convent was found on our path, we 
were compelled to penetrate it. Why so ? Because the convent, which 
is common to the East as well as to the West, to ancient as well as 
to modern times, to Paganism as well as to Buddhism, to Mahom- 
etanism as well as to Christianity, is 'nane of the optical appliances 
turned by man upon the Infinite. 

This is not the place for the development at length of certain 
ideas; however, while rigidly maintaining our reservations, our 
limits of expression, and even our impulses of indignation; when- 
ever we meet with the Infinite in man, whether well or ill under- 
stood, we are seized with an involuntary feeling of respect. There 
in the synagogue, in the mosque, a hideous side that we detest, and 
in the pagoda and in the wigwam, a sublime aspect that we adore. 
What a subject of meditation for the mind, and what a limitless 
source of reverie is this reflection of God upon the human wall! 

II 

THE CONVENT AS A HISTORICAL FACT 

In the light of history, reason, and truth, monastic life stands 
condemned. 

Monasteries, when they are numerous in a country, are knots in 
the circulation; encumbrances, centres of indolence, where there 
should be centres of industry. Monastic communities are to the great 
social community what the ivy is to the oak, what the wart is to the 
human body. There prosperity and fatness are the impoverishment 
of the country. The monastic system, useful as it is in the dawn of 
civilisation, in effecting the abatement of brutality by the develop- 
ment of the spiritual, is injurious in the manhood of nations. 
Especially when it relaxes and enters upon its period of disorga- 
nisation, the period in which we now see it, does it become baneful, 
for every reason that made it salutary, in its period of purity. 

These withdrawals into convents and nKinasteries have had their

ones, and were possessed of Christ. At night, the lovely naked 
youth descended from the cross,' and became the rapture of the cell. 
Lofty walls guarded from all the distractions of real life the mystic 
Sultana, who had the Crucified for Sultan. A single glance without 
was an act of perfidy. The in pace took the place of the leather sack. 
Wliat they threw into the sea in the East, they threw into the earth 
in the West. On either side, poor women wrung their hands; the 
waves to those— to these the pit; there the drowned and here the 
buried alive. Monstrous parallelism ! 

In our clay, the champions of the Past, unable to deny these 
things, have adopted the altc;rnative of smiling at them. It has be- 
come the fashion, a convenient and a strange" one, to suppress the 
revelations cjf history, to invalidate the comments of philosophy, 
and to draw the pen across all unpleasant facts and all gloomy in- 
quiries. “Topics far declamation,” throw in the skillful. “Decla- 
mation,” echo the silly. Jean Jacques, a tleclaimcr; Diderot, a 
declaimer ; Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven, a declaimer ! I 
forget who it is who has lately made out Tacitus, too, a declaimer, 
Nero a victim, and “th.at poor Holophernes” a man really to be 
pitied. 

Facts, however, are stuliborn, and hard to baffle. The author of 
this book has seen, with his own eyes, about twenty miles from 
Brussels, a specimen of the Middle Ages, within eveiybocly’s reach, 
at the Abbey of Vilkirs — (he orifices of the secret dungeons in the 
middle of the meadow which was once the courtyard of the cloister, 
and, on the banks o/ the Dyle, four .stone cells’, half underground 
and half under water. These were in pace. Each of these dungeons 
has a remnant of an iron wicket, a clo.set, and a barred skylight, 
which, on the outside, i.stwo feet above the surface of the rive'r, and 
from the inside is si.x feet above the ground. Four feet in depth of 
the river flow.s akmg the outer face of the wall; the ground near by 
is constantly wet. This saturated soil was the only bed of the in 
pace (x'cupant. Iii one of these dungeons there remains the stump 
of an iron collar fixed in the wall ; in another may be seen a kind of 
.square bo.x, formed of four slabs of granite, too short for a human 
being to lie &lt;lown in, too low to stand in erect. Now, in this was 
place&lt;l a cnsiture like ourselves, and then a lid of stone was closed 
above her head. There it i.s. You can see it ; you can touch it. These 
in pace ; tljese dtuigeons ; these iron hinges ; these metal collars ; this 
lofty .skylight, {&gt;n a level with which the river runs; this box of 
stone, covered by its lid of granite, like a sepulchre, with this dif- 
ference, that it shut in the living and not the dead ; this soil of mud, 
this cess-jiool ; these oozing walls. Oh ! what declaimers 1

UPON WHAT CONDITIONS WK CAN KKSI’KCT 'I' HE PAST 

Monasticism, such as it was iir Spain, and surh a&gt; it in 11iibet, 
is for civilisation akintl()f ct^nsumption. It stups life short. lt» in 
one word, depopulates. Monastic incarccrat ion is castration. In 
Bairope, it has been a scourt^e, Adtl it) that, tiu* violence si) often 
done to conscicMice; the ecclesiastical callini; so fretpiently com- 
pulsory; the feudal systeni leaninif on th&lt;,‘ doihter; prina^Meniture 
emptying* into the nmuastery the surplus of tlu' family; tlie fero- 
cious cruelties which wo have just tlescrilted; the hi /na'c; numths 
closed, brains walled-tip, so many liaphvss intellects incarcerated in 
the dungeons of eternal vows; the assutupiiem of the gown, the 
burial of souls alive. Aild tltese indivitlnril jorrnenfs to the national 
(legrutlation, an(l, vvlaiever yttu inay he, you will find ynm *.elf shtid- 
dering at the sight of the frock and the veil, those two winding 
sheets of human invention. 

However, on certain points and in certain places, in spite of 
philosoj)hy, and in spite of pn^gress, the inottastu; spirit tHTstweres 
in the full hla/.eof the nineteenth century, and a idngular revival of 
asceticism, at this vtuy nuanent, ama/es the iiviliset! w»&gt;iic.h The 
persistence of snjKU'annuated inslitutiotm in striviitg &lt;&lt;» perjHitiate

tenacious folly of a childs garment tr\ ittg to clotlie a man, or the 
teiKlerness of a corjise retnniing to embrace the living,

C O S E T T E 435 

ancients-; their soothsayers practised it. Rubbing over a bfack- heifer 
with chalk, they would exclaim “She is white.” Bos cretatus. 

As for ourselves, we distribute our respect, here and there, and 
spare the past entirely, provided it will but consent to be dead. But, 
if it insist upon being alive, we attack it and endeavour to kill it. 

Superstitions, bigotries, hypocrisies, prejudices, these phantoms, 
phantoms though they be, are tenacious of life ; they have teeth and 
nails in their shadowy substance, and we must grapple with them, 
body to body, and make war upon them and that, too, without ces- 
sation; for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned 
to eternal struggle with phantoms. A shadow is hard to seize by the 
throat and dasli upon the ground. 

A convent in P’rance, in'the high noon of the nineteenth century, 
is a college of owls confronting the day. A cloister in the open act 
of asceticism in the full face of the city, of ’89, of 1830 and of 
1848, Rome Idooming forth in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordi- 
nary times, to disperse an anachronism and cause it to vanish, one 
has only to make it spell the year of our Lord. But, we do not live in 
ordinary times. 

Let us attack, then. 

Let us attack, but let us di.stinguish. The characteristic of truth is 
never to run into excess. What need has she of exaggeration ? Some 
things inust be destroyed, and some things must be merely cleared 
up and investigated. What power there is in a courteous and serious 
examination ! Let us not therefore carry flame where light alone 
will suflice. 

Well, then, a.ssuming that we are in the nineteenth century, wc 
are oppo.sed, as a general proposition, and in every nation, in Asia 
as well as in PIurofKJ, in Judea as well as in Turkey, to ascetic seclu- 
sion in monasteries. He who says “convent” says “marsh.” Theij 
putrescence is ai&gt;parent, their stagnation is baleful, their femiem 
tation fevers and infects the nations, and their increase becomes an 
Egyptian plague. We cannot, without a shudder, think of those 
countries where Fakirs, Bonzes, Santons, Caloyers, Marabouts, and 
Tala|)oin.s multiply in swarms, like vermin. 

Having said this much, the religious question still remains. This 
question has some mysterious aspects, and we must ask leave to 
look it steadily in the face.

Men come together and live in common. By what right ? By virtue 
of the right of association.

every man has to open or to shut his door.

PRAYER 


They pray. 

To whom? 

To God. 

Pray to God, what is meant by that? 

Is there an infinite outside of us ? Is this infinite, one, inherent, 
permanent ; necessarily substantial, because it is infinite, and be- 
cause, if matter were wanting to it, it would in that respect be 
limited ; necessarily intelligent, because it is infinite, and because, 
if it lacked intelligence, it would be to that extent, finite ? Does this 
infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we are able to at- 
tribute to ourselves the idea of existence only? In other words, ii 
it not the absolute of which we axx the relative ? 

At the .same time, while there is an infinite outside of us, is them 
not an infinite within us? These two infinites (fearful plural!) do 
they not rest super-posed on one another? Does not the second in- 
finite underlie the first, so to speak? Is it not the mirror, the re- 
flection, the echo of tlie first, an alxyss concentric with another 
abyss? I.S this second infinite, intelligent also? Does it think? Does 
it love ? Does it will ? If the two infinites be intelligent, each one of 
them has a will principle, and there is a “me” in the infinite above, 
as there is a “me” in the infinite below. The “me” below is the soul ; 
the “me” above is God. 

To place, by proces.s of thought, the infinite below in contact with 
the infinite above, is called “prayer.” 

Let us not take anything away from the human mind ; suppres- 
sion is evil. We must reform and transform. Certain faculties of 
man are directed towards the Unknown; thought, meditation, 
prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What is conscience? It is the 
compass of the Unknown. Thought, meditation, prayer, these are 
the great, mysterious pointings of the needle. Let us respect them. 
Whither tend these majestic irradiations of the soul? into the 
shadow, tltut is, towards the light. 

The grandeur of democi'acy is that it denies nothing and re- 
nounces nothing of humanity. Close by the rights of Man, side by 
side with them, at least, are the rights of the Soul. 

To crush out fanaticisms and revere the Infinite, such is the law. 
Let us not confine ourselves to falling prostrate beneath the tree 
of Creation and contemplating its vast ramifications full of stars. 
We have a duty to perform, to cultivate the human soul, to defend 
mystery against miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject 
the absurd; to admit nothing that is inexplicable excepting what is 



438 L E s M I s K k A n l i-: s 

necessary, to purify faith and oliliterale su]H‘rstition fnun tlie face 
of religion, to remove the vermin from tlie garden t.&gt;f (l&lt;Ki. 


VI 


ABSOLUTE EXCELLENCE dl' 1‘KAVKR 

As to methods of prayer, all arc good, if they lu» l"mt sincere. Turn 
yotir book over and lie in the inlinitc. 

There is, we are aware, a plnlosopliy that d(’iiit‘s the infinite. 
There is also a philosophy, classed |)atlioit&gt;gicaiiy, winch denies the 
sun ; this philosophy is called IdiiKhicss. 

To set up a sense we lack as a stmree id' trutln is a fnu* piece of 
blind man’s assurance. 

And the rarity of it consists in the hanghty air of su}»eriorilv and 
compassion which is assumed towards tlie piiijMsujiiiy tliaf sees 
God, by this [ihilosopliy that has to groju’ its way. It inakes one 
think of a mole exclaiming: ‘*Jlow tliey excite my idty with their 
prate aljotii a sun !’* 

There arc, we know, illustrious and mighty adieists. These men 
in fact, led round again towards truth l»y their very power, are not 
alisolutely sure of being atheists: with tlicm. tin? luatter is Uoiliing 
but a (jucslion of &lt;lefmitions, and. at all events, if tluw do not believe 
in iJud, lieing great minds, they \n\n v i iod. 

We hail, in iiiein, philosophers, while, at the same time, inex* 
orahly &lt;lisputing their philosophy. 

But, let us [irocced. 

An adnriralde thing, too, is the facility settling everything to 
one’s satisfaction with words. A metai&gt;hv acal s* hool at the North, 
sliglUly iinprtgnaled with the fogs, has imapjued that it efiected a 
revolution in the human understartilita; liy suhdimiiug for the word 

Force’' tht‘ word ‘'Will.” 

To say, ”tlie plant wills,” instea*! u{ ‘hhe plan! grows,” would be 
indeed pregnant with meaning if you were to add, universe 
willsT Why? Because this would i!ow from it : the plant wills, then 
it hits a “mef^ the universe wills, then it Itas a t iMiI, 

To us, however, who, in direct opposiunn to this sritool. reject 
nothing a prUm^ a will in the plant, which i awepied hy this 
vsehool, api&gt;ears more difiknilt to admit, than a will in tlie universe, 
which it denies. 

To deny the will of the infmitt*, tliat is to sav God. cim In* done 
only on eondition of denying ilu; iniuiile iisdp We have demon- 
slrateif that. 

Denial of the infinite h*ads directly to nilulism. Ixverytljing be- 
comes ”a am&lt;Tptinn of ifie mind,” 

Willi nilnlisrn no discussion is possilik*. For the logical nihilist 



C O S E T T E 439 

doubts the existence of his interlocutor, and is not quite sure that 
he exists himself. 

From his point of view it is possible that he may be to himself 
only a “conception of his mind.” 

I'lowever, he does not perceive that all he has denied he admits 
in a mass by merely pronouncing the word “mind.” 

To sum up, no path is left open for thought by a philosophy that 
makes everything come to but one conclusion, the monosyllable 
“No.” 

To “No,” there is but one reply: “Yes.” 

Nihilism has no scope. There is no nothing. Zero does not exist. 
Everything is something. Nothing is nothing. 

Man lives l)y affirmation even more than he does by bi-ead. 

To behold and to show forth, even these will not suffice. Phi- 
losophy .should l)e an energy ; it should find its aim and its effect in 
the amelioration of mankind. Socrates should enter into Adam and 
produce Marctus Atirelius — in other words, bring forth from the 
man of enjoyment, the man of wisdom — ^and change Eden into the 
Lyceum. Science should be a cordial. Enjoyment ! What wretched 
aim, and what pitiful ambition ! The brute enjoys. Thought, this is 
the true triumjdi of the soul. To proffer thought to the thirst of 
men, to give to all, as an elixir, the idea of God, to cause conscience 
and science to fraternise in them, and to make them good men by 
this mysterious confrontation — such is the province. of true phi- 
losophy. Morality is truth in full bloom. Contemplation leads to 
action. The absolute should be practical. The ideal must be made air 
and food and drink to the human mind. It is the ideal which has 
the right to say : Take of it, this is my flesh, this is my blood. Wis- 
dom is a .sacred communion. It is upon that condition tlrat it cea.ses 
to be a sterile love of science, and becomes the one and supreme 
method by which to rally humanity; from philosophy it is pro- 
moted to religion. 

Philosophy .should not be a mere watch-tower, built upon mys- 
tery, from which to gaxe at ease upon it, with no other result than 
to be a convenience for the curious. 

For ourselves, postponing the development of our tliought to 
some other occasion, we will only say that we do not comprehend 
either man a.s a starting-imint, or progre.ss as the goal, without 
those two forces which are the two great motors, faith and love. 

I’rogress is the aim, the ideal is the model. 

What is the ideal ? It is God. 

Ideal, absolute, perfection, the infinite — ^these are identical 
words.

PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN IN CENSURE 

History and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same 
time, simple duties — to oppose Caiaphas as ])ishop, Draco as judge, 
Trimalcion as legislator, and Tiberius as emperor, Hu's is clcar^ 
direct, and limpid, and presents no obscurity. But the right to live 
apart, even with its inconveniences and al)uses, must be verified and 
dealt with carefully. The life of the ctmobite is a lumian problem. 

When we speak of convents, those seats of error but of inno- 
cence, of mistaken views but of good intentions, of ignorance but 
of devotion, of torment but of martyrdom, we imist luiarly always 
have ‘"Yes’" and "‘No” upon our lips. 

A convent is a contradiction,— its object salvation, its means self- 
sacrifice. The convent is supreme egtiiisni resulting in supreme self- 
denial. 

‘‘Abdicate that you may reign’’ seems to Ik* the device of inonas- 
ticism. 

In the cloister they six/Tcr that tlu‘v may enjoy -tluw draw a bill 

of exchange on death — they discount; the ct*Iestial sph'udour in ter- 
restrial night. In the cloister, ludl is accepted as the charge made in 
advance on the future inheritance of heaven. 

The assumption of the veil or tlie frock is a suicide reimbursed 
by an eternity. 

It seems to us tluit, in treating sudi a subject, raillery would be 
quite out of place, Bwerything relating to it is serious, {he good as 
well as the evil. 

■The good man knits his brows, but never smiles with the bad 
man’s smile. We can understuiul ang(‘r but not malignity. 


VII I 

FAiTir— n.\w 


A FEW words more. 

We blame the Church when it is saturated with intrigues; we 
despise the spiritual when it is liarshly austt*re to tlm temporal; but 
we honour everywhere, the thoughtful man. 

We l)ow^ to tlie man who kneels. 

A faith is a necessity to man. Woe to liiin who Indieves nothing. 

^ A man is not idle, because lie is ubsorbiKl in tlunight. There is a 
visible labour and there is an invisible lalHiur, 

To meditate is to labour; to think is to act. 

Folded arms work, closetl hands mrfurin. a gmt* fixed on heaven

COSET TE 441 

Thales remained motionless for four years. He founded 
philosophy. 

In our eyes, cenobites are not idlers, nor is the recluse a sluggard. 

To think of the Gloom is a serious thing. 

Without at all invalidating what we have just said, we believe 
.that a perpetual remembrance of the tomb is proper for the living. 
On this point, the priest and the philosopher agree ; We must die. 
The Abbe of La Trappe answers Horace. 

To mingle with one’s life a certain presence of the sepulchre is 
the law of the wise man, and it is the law of the ascetic. In this re- 
lation, the ascetic aiid the sage tend towards a common centre. 

There is a material advancement ; we desire it. There is, also, a 
moral grandeur ; we hold fast to it. 

Unreflecting, headlong minds say : 

“Of what use are tho,se motionless figures by the side of mystery? 
What purpose do they serve ? What do they effect ?” 

Alas ! in the presence of that obscurity which surrounds us and 
awaits us, not knowing what the vast dispersion of all things will do 
with us, we answer : There is, perhaps, no work more sublime than 
that which is accomplished by these souls ; and we add, There is no 
labour, perhaps, more useful. 

Those who pray always are necessary to those who never pray. 

In our view, the whole question is in the amount of thought that 
is mingled with prayer. 

Leibnitz, praying, is something grand ; Voltaire, worshipping, is 
something beautiful. Deo ercxit Voltaire. 

We are for religion against the religions. 

We are of those who believe in the pitifulness of orisons, and in 
the sublimity of prayer. 

Besides, in this moment through^ which we are passing, a mo- 
ment which happily will not leave its stamp upon the nineteenth 
century ; in this hour which finds so many with their brows abased 
so low and their souls so little uplifted, among so many of the liv- 
ing whose motto is happiness, and who are occupied with the brief, 
mis-shapen things of matter, whoever is self-exiled seems vener- 
able to us. The monastery is a renunciation. Self-sacrifice, even 
when misdirected, is still self-sacrifice. To assume as duty an unin- 
viting error has its peculiar grandeur. 

Considered in itself, ideally, and holding it up to truth, until it is 
impartially and exhaustively examined in all its aspects, the mon- 
astery, and particularly the convent — for woman suffers most under 
our system of society, and in this exile of the cloister there is an 
element of protest — ^the convent, we repeat, has, unquestionably, 
a certain majesty.

BOOK EIGHT 

CEMETERIES TAKE WHAT IS GIVEN THEM 

I 

WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING THE CONVENT 

Into this house it was that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent said, 
“fallen from heaven.” 

He had crossed the garden wall at the corner of the Rue Polon- 
ceau. That angels’ hymn which he. had heard in the middle of the 
night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall of which he had 
caught a glimpse in the obscurity, was the chapel ; that phantom 
which he liad seen c.xtendcd on the floor was the sister perf onning 
the reparation ; that bell the sound of which had so s'-rangely sur- 
prised him was the gardener’s bell fastened to old Fauchelevent’s 
knee. 

When Cosettc had been put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauche- 
levent had, as we have seen, taken a glass of wine and a piece of 
cheese before a blazing fire; then, the only bed in the shanty being 
occupied by Cosette, they had thrown themselves _ each upon a 
bundle of straw. Before closing his eyes, Jean Valjean had said; 
“Henceforth J must remain here.” These words were chasing one 
another through Fauchelevent’s head the whole night. 

To tell the truth, neither of them had slept. 

Jean Val jetui, teding that he was discovered and Javert was upon 
his track, knew full well that he and Cosette were lost should they 
return into the city. Since the new blast which had hurst tipon him, 
had thrown him into this cloister, Jean Valjean had hut one thought, 
to remain there. Now, for one in his unfortunate position, this con- 
vent was at once the safest and the most dangerous place ; the most 
dangcrotts» for, no nian being xillowod to enter, if he should he &lt;iis-‘ 
covered; it was a flagrant crime, and Jean Valjean would take but 
one step from the convent to prison ; the safest, for if he succeeded 
in getting j&gt;ermission to remain, who would come there to look for 
him ? To live in an impossible place ; that would be safety. 

For his part, Fauchelevent was racking his brains. He began by 
deciding that he was utterly bewildered. How did Monsieur Made- 
leine come there, with such walls ! The walls of a clois^r are not so 
easily crossed. How did he happen to be with a child? A man does

COSETTE 445 


now for several years in this convent had destroyed his personality/ 
and had at last rendered some good action necessary to him. 

He formed his resolution then : to devote himself to Monsieur 
Madeleine. 

We have just described him as a poor Picardy peasant. The de- 
scription is true, but incomplete. At the point of this story at which 
we now are, a closer acquaintance with Fauchelevent becomes nec- 
essary. He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added 
craft to his cunning, and penetration to his simplicity. Having, from 
various causes, failed in his business, from a notary he had fallen to 
a cartman and labourer. But, in spite of the oaths and blows which 
seem necessary with horses, he had retained something of the 
notary. He had some natural wit ; he said neither I is nor I has ; he 
could carry on a conversation, a rare thing in a village ; and the 
other peasants said of him : he talks almost like a gentleman. Fau- 
chelevent belonged in fact to that class which the flippant and im- 
pertinent vocabulary of the last century termed half-ycoman, half - , 
clown; and which the metaphors falling from the castle to the 
hovel, label in the distribution of the commonalty: half -rustic, half- 
citicen, pepper-and-salt. Fauchelevent, although sorely tried and 
sorely used by Fortune; a sort of poor old soul worn threadbare, 
was nevertheless an impulsive man, and had a ver^ willing heart; 
a precious quality, which prevents one from ever being wicked. Flis 
faults and his vices, for such he had, were superficial ; and finally, 
his physiognomy was one of those which attract the observer. That 
old face had none of those ugly wrinkles in the upper part of the 
forehead which indicate wickedness or stupidity. 

At daybreak, having dreamed enormously, old Fauchelevent 
opened his eyes, and saw Monsieur Madeleine, who, seated upon 
his bunch of straw, was looking at Cosette as she slept. Fauchele- 
vent half arose, and said : — 

“Now that you are here, how are you going to manage to come 
in?” 


This question summed up the situation, and wakened Jean Val- 
jean from his reverie. 

The two men took counsel. 

“To begin with,” said Fauchelevent, “you will not set foot out- 
side of this room, neither the little girl nor you. One step in the 
garden, we are ruined.” 

“That is true.” 

“Monsieur Madeleine,” resumed Fauchelevent, “you have ar- 
rived at a very good time ; I mean to say very bad ; there is one of 
these ladies dangerously sick. On that account they do not look this 
way much. She must be dying. They are saying the forty-hour 
prayers. The whole community is in derangement. That takes up 
their attention. She who is about departing is a saint. In fact, we

they say : our cell, and I say : my shanty. 11iey are .UHin.t*’ tii iiave the

**Yvs Monsieur M»adt leiiu% in order lu rome in, ii is nt%'essary 
that you shtnild gel out.** 



C O S E T T E 447 

And, after waiting for a sound from the tolling bell to die away, 
Fauchelevent pursued : — 

“It would not do to have you found here like this. Whence do 
you come? for me you have fallen from heaven, because I know 
you : but for the nuns, you must come in at the door.” 

Suddenly^ they heard a complicated ringing upon another bell. 

“Oh !” said Fauchelevent, “that is the ring for the mothers. They 
are going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when anybody 
dies. She died at daybreak. It is usually at daybreak that people die. 
But cannot you go out the way you came in ? Let us see ; this is not 
to question you, but where did you come in ?” 

Jean Valjean became pale; the bare idea of climbing down again 
into that formidable street, made him shudder. Make your way out 
of a forest full of tigers, and when out, fancy yourself advised by 
a friend to return. Jean Valjean imagined all the police still swarm- 
ing in the quarter, ohScers on the watch, sentries everywhere, fright- 
ful fists sti-etchecl out towards his collar, — ^Javert, perhaps, at the 
corner of the square. 

“Impossible,” said he. “Father Fauchelevent, let it go that I fell 
from on high.” 

“Ah ! I believe it, I believe it,” replied Fauchelevent. “You have 
no need to tell me so. God must have taken you into his hand, to 
have a close look at you, and then put you down. Only he meant 
to put you into a monastery ; he made a mistake. Hark ! another 
ring ; that is to warn the poi-ter to go and notify the municipality, 
so that they may go and notify the death-physician, so that he may 
come and see that there is really a dead woman. All that is the cere- 
mony of dying. These good ladies do not like this visit veiy much. 
A physician believes in nothing. He lifts the veil. He even lifts 
something else, sometimes. How soon they have notified the inspec- 
tor, this time ! Wliat can be the matter ? Your little one is asleep yet. 
What is her name?” 

“Cosette.” 

“She is your girl? that is to say: you should be her grand- 
father?” 

“Yes.” 

“For her, to get out will be easy. I have my door, which opens in- 
to the court. I knock; the porter opens. I have my basket on my 
back; the little girl is inside; I go out. Father Fauchekvent goes 
out with his basket — that is all siniple. You will tell the little girl to 
keep very still. She will be under cover. I will leave ^ as soon as 
I can, with a good old friend of mine, a fruiteress, in the Rue du 
Chemin Vert, who is deaf, and who has a little bed, I will scream 
into the fruiteress’s ear that she is my niece, and she must keep her 
for me till to-morrow. Then the little girl will come back with you ;

Jean Valjcaii shook his head. 

‘M.et nobody see me, that is all, I'atiu'r I’'aueheh've!U. Mtul some

Faxudielevent scratclied the tipiU’ his ear with the middle linger 
of his left hand—a sign of sericnis (‘inlnirrassment, 

A third ring made a diversitin. 

'That is tlui death-physician genng away.’* said Invuchelevent.

Jean Valjean saw him hasten across the garden, as fast' as his 
crooked leg would let him, with side glances at his melons the while.' 

In less than ten minutes, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put 
the nuns to flight as he went along, rapped softly at a door, and a 
gentle voice answered — Forever, Forever! that is to .say. Come in. 

This door was that of the parlour allotted to the gardener, for use 
when it was necessary to coniinunicate with him. This parlour was 
near the hall of the chapter. 'J'he iirioress, seated in the only chair in 
the parlour, was waiting for Fauchelevent. 


11 

l^-AUCUKLEVENT FACINC. TUI! niFFICUCTY 

A SKR10U.S and troubled hearing is peculiar, on critical occasions, 
to cerlain characters and certain professions, especially priests and 
monastics. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double 
sign of preoccuiiation marked the countenance of tlie prioress, the 
cliarming and learned Madenioi.selle de Blemcur, Mother Innocent, 
who was onlinarily cheerful. 

The gardener made a tinii&lt;l bow, and stopped at the threshold of 
the cell, 'riie prioress, who was .saying her rosary, raised her eyes 
and said : 

“Ah ! it is you, I'ather h'auvent.” 

This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent. 

Fauchelevent again began his bow. 

“Father Imuvent, I have called you." 

“I am here, reverend mother.” 

“I wish to .speak to you.” 

“And I, for my part,” said Fauchelevent, with a boldness at 
whicli he wa.s alarmed himself, “I have something to say to the most 
reverend mother.” 

The prioress looked at him. 

“Ah, you have a communication to make to me.” 

“A petition 1” 

“Well, what is it?” 

Goodman h'auchelevent, ex-notary, belonged to that class of peas- 
ants who are never disconcerted. A certain combination of igno- 
rance and skill is very effective ; you do not suspect it, and you ac- 
cede to it. Within little more than two years that he had lived in 
the convent, Fauchelevent had achieved a success in the community. 
Always alone, and even while attending to his ^rden, he had hardly 
anything to do but to be curious. Being, as he was, at a distance 
from all these veiled women, going to and fro, he saw before him 
hardly more than a fluttering of shadows. By dint of attention and 
penetration, he had succeeded in dothing all these phantoms with

MOTHER INNOCENT 

About a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and re- 
sumed her seat. 

Both seemed preoccupied. We report as well as we can the dialogue 
that followed. 

“Father Fauvent?” 

“Reverend mother ?” 

“You are familiar with the chapel?” 

• “I have a little box there to go to mass, and the offices.” 

“And you have been in the choir about your work ?”

“Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.” 

“A woman is never a man.” 

“We have only a woman to help you. Everybody does what he can. 
Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of 
St. Bernard, and Merlonus Horstius gives only three hundred and

Fauchelevent wiped his forehead. 

The prioress againmade a little low murmur, probably sacred, then 
raised her voice. 

“During her life. Mother Crucifixion worked conversions ; after 
her death, she will work miracles.” 

“She will 1” answered Fauchelevent, correcting his step, and mak- 
ing an effort not to blunder again. 

“Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother 
Crucifixion. Doubtless, it is not given to everybody to die like Car- 
dinal de Berulle, saying the holy mass, and to breathe out his soul to 
God, pronouncing these words : Hanc igitur oblationem. But without 
attaining to so great happiness. Mother Crucifixion had a very 
precious death. She had her consciousness to the last. She spoke to 
us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If 
you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she 
would have cured your leg by touching it. She smiled. We felt that 
she was returning to life in God. There was something of Paradise 
in that death.” 

Fauchelevent thought that he had been listening to a prayer. 

“Amen !” said he. 

“Father Fauvent, we must do what the dead wish.” 

The prioress counted a few beads on her chaplet. Fauchelevent 
was silent. She continued : 

“I have consulted upon this question several ecclesiastics labour- 
ing in Our Lord, who are engaged in the exercise of clerical func- 
tions, and with admirable results.” 

“Reverend mother, we hear the knell much better here than in the 
garden.” 

“Furthermore, .she is more than a departed one; she is a saint.” 

“Like you,_ reverend mother.” 

“She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by the express permission 
of our Holy Father, Pius VI 1.” ’ 

“He who crowned the Emp Buonaparte.” 

For a shrewd man like Fauchelevent, the reminiscence was unto- 
ward. Luckily^ the prioress, absorbed in her thoughts, did not hear 
him. She continued : 

“Father Fauvent?” 

“Reverend mother?” 

“St. Diodorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single 
word might be written upon his tomb: Acorns, which sonifies a 
worm of the dust ; that was done. Is it true?” 

“Yes, reverend mother.” 

“The blessed Mezzocane, Abb&lt; of Aquila, desired to be buried 
under the gibbet ; that was done." 

."It is true.” , ' ■ : .,,o 

“St. Terence, Bishop of Ostia, at the mouth of the Tiber, re- 



454 LESMISfiRABLES 

quested to have engraved upon his tomb the mark which was put 
upon the graves of parricides, in the hope that travellers would spit 
upon his grave. That was done. We must obcv the dead.” 

“So be it.” 

“The body of Bernard Guickwis, who was born in b'rance near 
Roche Abeille, was, as he has ordered, and in spite of the king of 
Castile, brought to the church of the Dominicans jit fa'inoges, al- 
though Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy, in Spain. Can this be 
denied ?” 

The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse. 

“No, indeed, reverend mother.” 

A few beads of her chaplet were told over silently. The prioress 
went on : • 

“Father Fauvent, Mother Cnicili.Nion will be burieil in the coffin 
in which she has slept for twenty years.” 

“That is right.” 

“It is a continuation ttf sleep.” 

“I shall have to nail her up then in th;it cofltn.” 

“Yes.” 

“And we will put aside the tuulerlaker’s cofltn?” 

“Precisely.” 

“I am at the dispo.sal of the most reverend comimmity,” 

“The four mother ehoristers will help you.” 

“To nail upthceofiln I don't need them.” 

“No. To let it down.” 

"Where?" 

“Into the vault.” 

“What vault?" 

“Under the altar." 

FaucheU'vent gave a start. 

“The vault under the altar !” 

“Under the altar.” 

"But—” 

“You will have an iron bar." 

“Yes, but " 

You will lift the .stone with the har liy nteaits of tlie riiiir ” 

"But——” 

"We must olicy the &lt;lea&lt;l. To be hiiriwl in the vault under the altar 
of the chapel, not to go into profane ground, to miuiin in death where 
she prayed m life ; this was the last re(niesi of Mother Crucifixion. 
She has asked it, that is to say, comm.'mdetl it.” 

“Rut h is forbidden.” 

“Forbidden by men, enjoined by God." 

“If it should come to be known ?" 

“Wfi have confidence in you." 

"Oh 1 as for me, I am like a stone in your wait” 



COSET TE ^ 455 

“The chapter has assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just- 
consulted again and who are now deliberating, have decided' that 
Mother Crucifixion should be, according to her desire, buried in her 
coffin under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if there should be 
miracles performed here ! what glory under God for the community 1 
Miracles spring from tombs.” 

“But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the Health Commission — ” 
“St. Benedict II., in the matter of burial, resisted Constantine 
Pogonatus." 

“However, the Commissary of Police ” 

“Chonodemaire, one of the seven German Icings who entered Gaul 
in the reign of Constantins, cxpres.sly recognised the right of con- 
ventuals to be inhumed in religion, that is to say, under the altar.” 

“But the Inspector of the Prefecture ” 

“The world is nothing before the cross. Martin, eleventh general 
of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device : Slat crux dum 
volviliir orhis." 

“Amen,” said Fauchelevcnt, imperturbable in this method of ex- 
tricating himself whenever he heard any Latin. 

Any audience whateveiiis sufficient for one who has been too long 
silent. On the day that the rhetorician Gymnastoras came but of 
prison, full of .suppressed dilemmas and .syllogisms, he stopped be- 
fore the fir.st tree he met with, harangued it, and put forth very great 
efforts to convince it. The priorcs.s, habitually subject to the con- 
straint of silence, and having a surplus in her reservoir, rose, and ex- 
claimed with the loquacity of an opened mill-sluice: 

“I have on my right Benedict, and on my left Bernard. Wliat is 
Bernarcl ? he is the first Abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy 
is blessed for having been hi.s birthplace. Plis father’s name was 
Tecelin, and hi.s mother’s Alethe. He began at Citeaux, and ended 
at Clairvaux ; he was ordained abbot by the Bishop of Chalons-sur- 
Saone, Guillaume de Chamiieaux ; he had seven hundred novices, 
and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeil- 
ard at the Council of Sens tn 1140, and Peter de Bruys and Henry 
his disciple, and another heterodox set called the Apostolicals ; he 
confounded Arnold of Brescia, struck monk Ralph dumb, the slayer 
of the Jews, presided in 1 148 over the Council of Rlieims, caused 
Gilbert de la Porde, Bishop of Poitiers, to be condemned, caused Eon 
de I’Etoile to be condemned, arranged the differences of princes, ad- 
vised the King, Louis the Young, coun.selled Pope Eugenius IIL, 
regulated the I'emple, preached the Crusade, performed two hundred 
and fifty miracles in his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one 
day. What is Benedict ? he is the patriarch of Monte Cassino ; he is 
the second founder of the Claustral Holiness, hq is the Basil of the 
West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, 
fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundeefeli iccch&amp;shops. four thousand six 



4S6 LESMISfiEABLES 

hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, 
forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonised saints, and 
has existed for fourteen hundred years. On one side, St. Bernard; 
on the other the agent of the Health Commission ! On one side, St' 
Benedict ; on the other the sanitary inspector ! The state. Health De- 
partment, funeral regulations, rules, the administration, do we recog- 
nise these things ? Anybody would be indignant to see how we are 
treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ ! 
Your sanitary commission is an invention of the revolution. God 
subordinated to the commissary of police ; such is this age. Silence 
Fauvent !” 

Fauchelevent, beneath this douche, was not quite at ease. The 
prioress continued : 

“The right of the convent to burial cannot be doubted by anybody. 
There are none to deny it save fanatics and those who have gone as- 
tray. We live in times of terrible confusion. People are ignorant of 
what they ought to know, and know those things of which they ought 
to be ignorant. They are gross and impious. There are people in these 
days who do not distinguish between the great St. Bernard and the 
Bernard entitled des Pativres Catholiques^a certain good ecclesiastic 
who lived in the thirteenth century. Others blaspheme so far as to 
couple the scaffold of Louis XVI. with the cross of Jesus Christ. 
Louis XVI. was only a king. Let us then take heed for God ! There 
are no longer either just or unjuse. Voltaire’s name is known, and 
the name of Caesar de Bus is not known. Nevertheless Caesar de Bus 
is in bliss and Voltaire is in torment. The last archbishop, the Cardi- 
nal of Perigord, did not even know that Charles de Gondren suc- 
ceeded Berulle, and Francis Bourgoin, Gondren, and Jean Francois 
Senault, Bourgoin, and Father de Sainte-Marthe, Jean Francois 
Senault. The name of Father Cotton is known, not because he was 
one of the three who laboured in the foundation of the Oratory, but 
because he was the subject of an oath for the Huguenot King Henry 
IV. St. Francois de Sales is popular with the world, because he 
cheated at play. And then religion is attacked. Why? Because there 
have been wideed priests, ba'ause Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was a 
brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and both were followers of 
Mammon. What does that amount to ? Does that prevent Martin de 
Tours from being a saint and having given half his cloak to a poor 
man ? The saints are persecuted. Men shut their eyes to the truth. 
Darkness becomes habitual. The most savage beasts are blind beasts. 
Nobody thinks of hell in earnest. Oh! the wicked people! By the 
king, now means, by the revolution. Men no longer know what is due 
tothehving^or.the dead. Holy death is forbidden. The sepulchre is a 
civil arair. This is horrible, St. Leo IL wrote two. letters expressly, 
one to 'Peter Notaire, the other to the King of the Visigoths, to com- 
bat and overthrow, upon questions touching the dead, the authority 



COSETTE 45/ 

of the ex-arch and the supremacy of the emperor. Walter, Bishop of 
Chalons, in this matter made opposition to Otho, Duke of Burgundy. 
The ancient magistracy acceded to it. Formerly we had votes in the 
chapter concerning secular affairs. The Abbot of Citeaux, general 
of the order, was hereditary counsellor of the Parlement of Bur- 
gundy. We do with. our dead as we please. Is not the body of St. 
Benedict himself in France in the 'Abbey of Fleury, called St. Bene- 
dict sur Loire, though he died in Italy, at Monte Cassino, on a Sat- 
urday, the 21st of the month of March in the year 543 ! All this is in- 
contestable. I abhor the Psallants, I hate the Prayers, I execrate 
heretics, but I should detest still more whoever might sustain the 
contrary of what I have said. You have only to read Arnold Wion, 
Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemius, Maurolicus, and Dom Luke d’Achery.” 
. The prioress drew breath, then turning towards Fauchelevent : 

“Father Fauvent, is it settled ?” 

“It is settled, reverend mother.” 

“Can we count upon you ?” 

“I shall obey.” 

“It is well.” 

“I am entirely devoted to the convent.” 

“It is understood, you will close the coffin. The sisters will carry it 
into 'the chapel. The office for the dead will be said. Then they will 
return to the cloister. Between eleveir o’clock and midnight, you will 
come with your iron bar. All will be done with the greatest secrecy. 
There will be in the chapel only the four mother choristers. Mother 
Ascension, and you.” 

“And the sister who will be at the post.” 

“She will not turn.” ’ 

“But she will hear.” 

“She will not listen ; moreover, what the cloister knows the world 
does not know.” 

There was a pau.se again. The prioress continued : ' 

“You will take off your bell. It is needless that the sister at th*. 
post should perceive that you are there.” 

“Reverend mother?” 

“What, Father Fauvent?” 

“Has the death-physician made his visit ?” 

“He is going to make it at four o’clock to-day. The bell has beett 
sounded which summons the death-physician. But you do not hear 
any ring then?” 

“I only pay attention to my own.” 

“That is right. Father Fauvent.” 

‘ "Reverend mother, I shall need a lever at least six feet long.” 

“Where will you get it ?” 

"Where there sfre gratings there are always iron bars. I have my 
heap of old iron at the back of the garden.”

“Yott are right. Earth is the same thing as man. So you will pre- 
pare the empty coffin ?” 

“I will attend to that.” 

The face of the prioress, till then dark and anxious, became again 
serene. She made him the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior. 
Fauchelevent moved towards the door. As he was going out, the 
prioress gently raised her voice. 

“Father Fauvent, I am satisfied with you; to-morrow after the 
burial, bring your brother to me, and tell him to bring his daughter.”

IN WniCTI JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING 
READ AUSTIN CASTILLEJO 

The strides of the lame are like the glances of the one-eyed ; they do 
not speedily reach their aim. Furlliermore, Fauchelevent w'as per- 
plexed. It took liim nearly a quarter of an hour to get back to the 
shanty in llie garden. Coseltc was awake. Jean Valjcan had seated her 
near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Val- 
jean was showing her the gardener^s basket hanging on the wall and 
saying to her : 

“Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go away 
from this house, but we shall come back, and we shall be very well 
off here. Tlie good man here will carry you out on his back inside 
there. You will wait for me at a lady’s. I shall come and find you. 
Above all, if you do not want the Thenardiess to take you back, obey 
and say nothing.” ^ ' 

Cosette nodded her head with a serious look. , 

At tlic sound of Fauchelevent opening the door, Jean Valjean 
turned, 

“Well?” 

“All is arranged, and nothing is,” said Fauchelevent. “I have per- 
mission to bring you in ; but lie fore bringing you in, it is necessary to 
get you out. That is where the cart is blocked! For the little girl, it is 
easy enough.” 

“You will carry her out?” 

“And she will keep quiet?” 

“I will answer for it.” 

“But you, Father Madeleine ?” 

And, after an anxious silence, Fauchelevent exclaimed : 

“But why not go out the way you came in ?” 

Jean Valjean, as before, merely answered: “Impossilile.” 



460 L E S if I S K K A H L K S 

P'auchekvent, talking iimre in himself than tii Jean Valjean

C O S ET T E 


"What living body ?” 

“Me,” said Jean Valjean. 

Fauchelevent, who had taken a seat, sprang up as if a cracker had 
burst under his chair. 

“You !” 

“Why not?” 

Jean Valjean had one of those rare smiles which came over him 
like the aurora in a winter sky. 

You know, P aiichelevent, that you saidi Mother Crucifixion is 
dead, and that I added : and Father Madeleine is buried. It will be so.” 

“Ah ! good, you are laughing, you are not talking seriously.” 

“Very seriously. I must get out !” 

“Undoubtedly.” 

“And I told you to find a basket and a cover for me also ” 

"Well!” 

“The basket will be of pine, and the cover will be of black cloth.” 

■'Tn the first place, a white cloth. The nuns are buried in white ” 

“Well, a white cloth.” 

“You are not like other men. Father Madeleine.” 

To see such devices, which are nothing more tlian the savage and 
foolhardy inventions of the galleys, appear in the midst of the peace- 
ful things that surrounded liim and mingled with what he called the 
“little jog-jog of the convent,” was to Fauchelevent an astonishment 
comparable to that of a person who should see a seamew fishing in 
the brook in the Rue St. Denis. 

Jean Valjean continued : 

"The question is, how to get out without being seen. This is the 
means. But in the first place tell me, how is it done ? where is this 
coffin?” 

“The empty one?” 

"Yes." 

"Down in what is called the dead'tfoom. It is on two trestles and 
under the pall.” 

“What is the length of the coffin ?” 

"Six feet.” 

"What is the dead-room ?” 

“It is a room on the ground floor, with a grated window towards 
the garden, closed on the outside with a shutter, and two doors ; one 
leading to the convent, the other to the church.” 

“What church ?” , 

"The church on the street, the church for everybody ?” 

"Have you the keys of those two doors?” 

"No, I have the key of the door that opens into the convent ; the 
porter has the key of the door that opens into the church.” 

“When does the porter open that door?”

“Only to let in the bearers, who come alter the cuffm ; as soon as '

"Who nails up the coffin ?” 

“I do.” 

“Who puts the cloth on it ?” 

"1 do.” 

"Arc you alone?" 

“No cither man, except the police phydci.-m, c.iu eiiler the dead-

Faucliek'vent started hack, and hegaii to ■■nap his liiigei s,

"I’sli.aw! to take .a hammer and drive soiiie nail;, into a lueird ?" 

What seemed imheard~of tii laaiuhehoent was. we repeat, .simple 
to Jean Valjean. Jean \’al jeati liad Iteeii in tvorse .traits, ! !e who has

gloomy lidents of jean Valje.an. 

Moreover, a cotfin in wltich there is a living being, that convict’s

“Good ! But if you happen to cough or sneeze?” 

“He who is escaping never coughs and never sneezes.” 

And Jean Val jean added : 

“Father Fauchelevent, I must decide: either to be taken here, or 
to be willing to go out in the hearse.” 

Everybody has noticed the taste which cats have for stopping and 
loitering in a half-open door. Who has not said to a cat i Why don’t 
you come in ? There are men who, with an opportunity half-open 
before them, have a similar tendeircy to remain undecided between 
two resolutions, at the risk of being crushed by destiny abruptly 
closing the opportunity. The over prudent, cats as they are, and be- 
cause they are cats, sometimes run more danger than the bold. Fau- 
chelevent was of this hesitating nature. However, Jean Valjean’s 
coolness won him over in spite of himself. He grumbled : 

“It is true, there is no other way.” 

Jean Valjean resumed : 

“The only thing that I am an.xious about, is what will be done at 
the cemetery.” 

“That is jiust what does not embarrass me,” exclaimed Fauchele- 
vent. “If you are sure of getting yourself out of the coffin, I am sure 
of getting you out of the grave. The gravedigger is a drunkard and 
a friend of mine. He is Father Mcstienne. An old son of the old vine. 
The gravedigger puts the dead in the grave, and I put the gi-avedig- 
ger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take place. We shall arrive 
a little before du.sk, three-quarters of an hour before the cemetery 
gates are closed. The hearse will go to the grave. I shall follow: that 
is my business. I will have a hammer, a chisel, and some pincers in 
my pocket. The hearse stops, tlie bearers tie a rope around your cof- 
fin and let you down. The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of 
the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and is off. I remain alone with 
Father Mestieime. He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things; 
either he will be drunk, or he will not be drunk. If he is not drunk, 
I say to him : come and take a drink before the Good Quince is shut 
I get hi 1 away, I iddle him ; Father Mestienne is not long in get- 
ting fuddled, he i * i Iways half way. I lay him under the table, I take 
his card from him to return to the cemetery with, and I come back 
without him. You will have only me to deal with. If he is drunk, I 
say to him : be off. I’ll do your work. He goes away, and I pull you 
out of the hole.” 

Jean Valjean extended his hand, upon which Fauchelevent threw 
hinisiclf with a rustic outburst of touching devotion. 

“It is ..ettlcd, leather Fauchelevent. All will go well," 

“Provided nothing goes amiss,” thought Fauchelevent. “How 
terrible that would be I”

IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE A DBUNKAIH) TO BE IMMORTAL 

Next day, as the sun was declining, the scattered passers on the 
Boulevard du Maine took off their hats at the passage of an old-fash- 
ioned hearse, adorned with death’s-heads, cross-bones, and tear- 
drops. In this hearse there was a coffin covered with a white cloth, 
upon which was displayed a large black cross like a great dummy with 
hanging arms. A draped carriage, in which might be seen a priest in 
a.surplice, and a choir-boy in a red calotte, followed. Two bearers in 
grey uniform with black trimmings walked on the right and left of 
the hearse. In the rear came an old man dressed like a labourer, who 
limped. The procession moved towards the Vaugirard cemetery. 

Sticking out. of the man’s pocket were the handle of a hammer, 
the blade of a cold chisel, and the double handles of a pair of pincers. 

The Vaugirard cemetery was an exception among the cemeteries 
of Paris. It had its peculiar usages, so far that it had its porte-co- 
chere, and its small door which, in the quarter, old people tenacious 
of old words, called the cavalier door, and the pedestrian door. The 
Bernardine-Benedictines of the Petit idepus liad ol)taincd tlic right, 
as we have said, to be buried in a corner apart and at night, this 
ground having formerly belonged to their ccanmunity. The grave- 
diggers, having thus to work in the cemetery in the evening in sum- 
mer, and at night in winter, were subject to a i)cculiar discipline. The 
gates of the cemeteries of Paris closed at that epoch at sunset, and, 
this being a measure of municipal order, the Vaugirard cemetery 
was subject to it like the rest. The cavalier door and the pedestrian 
door were two contiguous gratings ; near which was a pavilion built 
by the architect Perronet, in which the door-keeper of the cemetery 
lived. These gratings therefore inexorably turned upon their hinges 
the instant the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides! If 
any gravedigger, at that moment, was belated in the cemetery his 
only resource for getting out was his gravedigger’s card, given him 
by the administration of funeral ceremonies. A sort of letterbox was 
arranged in the shutter of the gate-keeper’s window. The gravedig- 
ger dropped his card into this box, the gate-keeper heard it fall, 
pulled the string, and the pedestrian door opened. 1 f the gravedigger 
did not have his card, he gave his name ; the gate-keeptir, sometimes 
in bed and asleep, got up, went to identify the gravedigger, and 
open the door with the key ; the gravedigger went out, but paid fif- 
teen francs fine. 

This cemetery, with its peculiarities breaking over the rules, dis- 
turbed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed shortly 
after 1830. The Mont Parnasse Cemetery, called the Cemetery oi 
the East, has succeeded it, and has inherited this famous drinking 



C O S E T T E 465 

house let into the Vaugirard cemetery, whicn was ..armounted by a 
quince painted on a board, which looked on one side upon the tables 
of the drinkers, and on the other upon graves, with this inscription : 
The Good Quince. 

The Vaugirard cemetery was what might be called a decayed 
cemetery. It was falling into disuse. Mould was invading it, flower? 
were leaving it. Tlie well-to-do citizens little cared to be buried at 
Vaugirard ; it sounded poor. Pere Lachaise is very fine ! to be buried 
in PtTe Lachaise is like having mahogany furniture. Elegance is 
understood by that. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable in- 
closure, laid out like an old French garden. Straight walks, box, 
evergreens, hollies, old tombs under old yews, very high grass! 
Night there was terrildc. There were some very dismal outlines there. 

The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the v/hite pall and 
the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The 
lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent. 

The burial of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the 
departure of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean into the 
dead-room, all had been carried out without obstruction, and nothing 
had gone wrong. 

We will say, by the way, the inhumation of Mother Crucifixion 
under the convent altar is, to us, a perfectly venial thing. It is one of 
those faults which rescml)le a duty. The nuns had accomplished it, 
not only without discomposure, but with an approving conscience. 
In the cloister, what is called the ‘^government’^ is only an interfer*. 
ence with authority, an interference which is always questionable. 
First the rules ; as to the code, we will see. Men, make as many laws 
as you please, but keep them for yourselves. The tribute to Csesar 
is never more than th(^ remnant of the tribute to God. A prince is 
nothing in presence of a principle. 

Fauchelevent limped behind the hearse, very well satisfied. His 
two twin plots, one with the nuns, the other with M. Madeleine, one 
for the convent, the other against it, had succeeded equally well. 
Jean Val jean's calmness had that powerful tranquillity which is con- 
tagious. Inincliclevent had now no doubt of success. What remained 
to be done was nothing. Within two years he had fuddled the grave- 
digger ten times, good Father Mestienne, a rubicund old fellow. 
Father Mestienne was play for him. He did what he liked with him. 
He got him drunk at will and at his fancy. Mestienne saw through 
Faudielevent's eyes. Fauchelevent’s security was complete. 

At the moment the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cem- 
etery, Fauchelevent, ha])py, "looked at the hearse and rubbed his big 
hands together, saying in ah undertone: 

'TIere’s a farce V* 

Suddenly the hearse stopped ; they were at the gate. It was neces ■ 
sary to exhibit the burial permit. The undertaker whispered with 



466 LESMISfiRABLKS 

the porter of the cemeteiy. During this colli xjuy, which always 
causes a delay of a minute or two, somebody, an unknown man, came 
and placed himself behind the hearse at Faucliclcvent’s side. He was 
a working-man, who wore a vest with large pockets, and had a pick 
under his arm. 

- Fauchelevent looked at this unknown man. 

“Who are you ?” he asked. 

The man answered : 

“The gravedigger.” 

Should a man survive a cannon-shot through his breast, he would 
present the appearance that Fauchelevent did. 

“The gravedigger ?” 

■“Yes.” 

“You !” 

“Me.” 

“The gravedigger is Father Meslienne.” 

“He was." 

“Plow! he was?” 

“Pie is dead.” 

Fauchelevent was ready for anything hut this, tltat a gravedigger 
could die. It is, however, true ; gravediggers Ihemselvtis die. By dint 
of digging graves for oIIkts, they oi&gt;en their own. 

Fauchelevent remained .sixwiiless. Pie htul hardly the strength 
to stammer out ; 

“But it's not possible !” 

“It is .so.” 

“But,” repeated he, feebly, “the gravedigger is Ftither Me,stienne.” 

After Napoleon, Lotiis XVII 1. After Mestieime, Criliier. Peas- 
ant, my name is Gribier.” 

I^'auchelevent grew pale; he stami at Gribier, 

He was a long, thin, livid man, jH-rfectly funereal. Tie htid the ap- 
pearance of a broken-down doctor ttirned gravedigger. 

Fauchelevent burst out latigliing, 

“Ah! what drpj! things happen ! bather Mestieime is dead. Little 
Father Mestienne i.s dead, but hurrah for little iuither l.enoir ! You 
^now what little Father Lencnr is ? It is th&lt;‘ mi for a six spot 
It Ls the nmg of Sumie, zotintls! r(*al f^aris Hureru*. he is dead, 
old Mestienne! I am mrry for it ; he was a Jollv fellow. Mill voti too, 
you are a jolly fellow. Isn’t that so, cotnrade? we will go and take a 
drmk together, right away.” 

The man answered: “I have studiwl, I have gradii.aled. I never 
drink.” 

1 he hearse had .started, and was rolling along the main avenue of 
the cemetery. 

Fauchelewnt had sl.ackened his jiace. He limml still more from 
anxiety than from infirmity. 



46 &gt; 


COSETTE 

The gravedigger walked before him. 

Fauchelevent again scrutinised the unexpected Gribier. 

He was one of those men who, though young, have an old appear- 
ance, and who, though thin, are very strong. 

^^Comrade T’ cried Fauchelevent. 

The man turned. 

"T am the gravedigger of the convent.” 

^'My colleague,” said the man. 

Fauchelevent, illiterate, but very keen, understood that he had to 
do with a very formidable species, a good talker. 

He mumbled out : 

‘Ts it so, Father Mestienne is dead ?” 

The man answered : 

“Perfectly. The good God consulted his list of bills payable. It 
^as Father Mestienne’s turn. Father Mestienne is dead.” 

Fauchelevent repeated mechanically. 

“The good God.” 

“The good God,” said the man authoritatively. “What the philoso-* 
phers call the Eternal Father ; the Jacobins, the Supreme Being.” 

“Are we not going to make each other’s acquaintance ?” stammered 
Fauchelevent. 

“It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.” 

“We are not acquainted as long as we have not drunk together, 
He who empties his glass empties his heart. Come and drink with 
me. You can’t refuse.” 

“Business first.” 

Fauchelevent said to himself : I am lost. 

They were now only a few rods from the path that led to the 
nuns’ corner. 

The gravedigger continued : 

“Peasant, I have seven youngsters that I must feed. As they must 
eat, I must not drink.” 

And he added with the satisfaction of a serious being who is mak- 
hig a sententious phrase : . 

“Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst.” 

The hearse turned a huge cypress, left the main path, took a littU. 
one, entered upon the grounds, and was lost in a thicket. This indh 
cated the immediate proximity of the grave. Fauchelevent slackened 
his pace, but could not slacken that of the hearse. Luckily the mel- 
low soil, wet by the winter rains, stuck to the wheels, and made the 
track heavy. 

He approached the gravedigger. 

“They have such a good little Argenteuil wine,” suggested Fau- 
chelevent, 

^'Villager,” continued the man, /T ought not to be a gravedigger. 
My father was porter at the Prytanfie. He intended me for literature.

But he was unfortunate. He met with losses at the 1 bourse., I was ob- 
liged to renounce the condition of an autlior. 1 Iowcvct, 1 am still a 
public scribe/' 

“But then you are not the gravedigger?'" replied l^'anchelevent^ 
catching at a straw, f eel)le as it was. 

“One does not prevent the other. I cunuilat(‘,'’ 

Fauclielevent did not understand tins last word. 

“Let us go and drink/" said he. 

Here an observation is necessary, h'auchelovent. whatever was 
his anguish, proposed to drink, but did not exidain himself on one 
point; who should pay? Ordinarily imtudielevtml |&gt;ropose(i, and 
Father Mestienne paid. A proposal to drink nsulted &lt;‘vitiei]tly from 
the new situation produced by the fact: of the new gravedigger, and 
this proposal he must make; hut the old gardener lt*ft. not uninten'- 
tionally, the proverbial quarter of an hotjr of K'ahelais in tlie shade; 
As for him, Faucheleveut, however cixcitcd Ite was, lie did not care 
about paying. 

The gravedigger went on, with a smile of stiperiorily : 

“We must live. I aceeiited the suceessirm i&gt;f h'atheV Mestienne. 
When one has almost finished his &lt;dasses, he is a philosiqiher. To 
the labour of my hand, I have abided the lalnjur of inv arm. 1 have

to me ; I patch up their declarations to their true loves. In the morn- 
ing 1 write love letters; in the evening I dig graves. Such is life, 
countryman," 

The hearse advanced ; Faucludeveut, full of anxiety, looked about 
him on all sides. Great drops of sweat were falling from liis fore- 
head, 

“However," continued the gravedigger, “ont^ cannot serve two 
mistresses ; 1 must choose between the i*eu and tlie pick. Hie pick 
hurts my hand." 

The hearse stoi&gt;i)ed. 

The choir-boy got out of the mourning carriage, lluii the |)riest. 

One of the forward wheels of the liearse nu»um(‘»l on a little heap 
of earth, beyond which was seen an open gravf*. 

“Here is a farce!" repealed Fauchelevent in consternation. 


VI 

IN THE NARROW HOU.SK 

Who was in the cofFm? We know. Jean Valjeaii. 

Jean Valjean had arranged it: so that he could live in it, and could 
breathe a very little. 

It is a strange thing to what extent an easy coiiHcience givtfs calm- 



COSETTE ' 469 

ness in other respects. The entire combination pre-arranged by Jean 
Valjean had been executed, and executed well, since the night before. 
He counted, as did Fauchelevent, upon Father Mestienne. He had 
no doubt of the result. Never was a situation more critical, never 
calmness more complete. ' 

The four boards of the coffin exhaled a kind of terrible peace. It 
seemed as if something of the repose of the dead had entered into the 
tranquillity of Jean Valjean. 

From within that coffin he had been able to follow, and he had 
followed, all the phases of the fearful drama which he was plavine 
with Death. 

Soon after Fauchelevent had finished mailing down the upper 
board, Jean Valjean had felt himself carried out, then wheeled along. 
By the diminished jolting, he had felt that he was passing from the 
pavement to the hard ground ; that is to say, that he was leaving the 
streets and entering upon the boulevards. By a dull sound, he had 
divined that they were crossing the bridge of Austerlitz. At the first 
stop he had comprehended that they were entering the cemetery ; at 
the second stop he had said : here is the grave. 

He felt that hands hastily seized the coffin, then a harsh scraping 
upon the boards ; he concluded that that was a rope which they were 
tying around the coffin to let it down into the excavation. 

Then he felt a kind of dizziness. 

Probably the bearer and the gravedigger had tipped the coffin and 
let the head down before the feet. Fie returned fully to himself on 
feeling that he was horizontal and motionless. He had touched the 
bottom. 

Fie felt a certain chill. 

A voice arose above him, icy and solemn. He heard pass away, 
some Latin words which he did not understand, pronounced so slow- 
ly that he could catch them one after another : 

''Qid dormiunt in tcrrce pidvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam cster^ 

• nain, et a! ii in op probrium, ut videant semper/^ 

A child’s voice said : 
profwidis** 

The deep voice recommenced : 

^'Requiem cetcniam dona ci, Domine/* 

The chikr.s voice responded : 
lux porpetua luceat ci!' 

Fie heard upon the board which covered him something like the 
gentle ])atter of a few drops of rain. It was probably the holy water. 

Fie thought : ‘This will soon be finished. A little more patience. 
The priest is going away. F"auchelevent will take Mestienne away to 
drink. I'hey will leave me. Then Fauchelevent will come back alone, 
and I shall get out. That will take a good hour,” 

The deep voice resumed. 



470 LESMISfiRABLES 

“Requiescat in pace.” 

And the child’s voice said : 

"Amen.” 

Jean Valjean, intently listening, perceived something like reced- 
ing steps. 

“Now there they go,” thought he. “I am alone.” 

All at once he heard a sound above his head which seemed to him 
Hike a clap of thunder. 

It was a spadeful of earth falling upon the coffin. 

A second spadeful of earth fell. 

One of the holes by which he breathed was stopped up. 

A third spadeful of earth fell. 

Then a fourth. 

There are things stronger than the strongest man. Jean Valjean 
lost consciousness. 

VII 

IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OP THE .SAYING I DON'T LOSE 

YOUR CARD 

Let us see what occurred over the coffin in which Jean Valjean lay. 

When the hearse had departeil and the priest and the choir-boy 
had got into the carriage, iind were gone, Fauchelevent, who had 
never taken his eyes off the gravedigger, saw him sloo]), and grasp 
his spade, which was standing upright in the hea)) of earth. 
Hereupon, Fauchelevent formed a supreme resolve. 

Placing himself between the grave and the gravedigger, and 
folding his arms, he said : 

“I’ll pay for it !” 

The gravedigger eyed him with amazement, and replied : 
“What, peasant?” 

Fauchelevent repeated : 

“I’ll pay for it !” 

“For what?” 

“For the wine.” 

“What wine?” 

“The Argenteuil.” 

“Where’s the Argenteuil ?” 

“At the Good Quince.” 

“Go to the devil !” said the gravedigger. 

And he threw a spadeful of earth upon the coffin. 

The coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself 
stagger, and nearly fell into the grave. In a voice in which the strang- 
ling sound of the death-rattle began to lie heard he cried : 

“Come, comrade, before the Good Qitigce clo.se.s !” 



C O S E T T E 472 

The gravedigger took up another spadeful of earth. Fauchelevent 
continued: 

“I’ll pay,” and he seized the gravedigger by the ann 

“Hark ye, comrade,” he said, “I am the gravedigger of the con- 
vent and have come to help you. It’s a job Ave can do at night Let 
as take a drink first. ^ * 

And as he spoke, even while clinging desperately to this urgent 
effort, he asked lumseLf, with some misgiving: “And even should 
he drink — will he get tipsy? 

ni.stic,” said the gravedigger, “if you insist, I consent 
We 11 have a drink, but after my work, never before it.” 

And he tossed his s]xide again. Fauchelevent held him 

“It is Argenteuil at si.v sous the pint !” 

“Ah, bah !” .said the gravedigger, “you’re a bore. Ding-dong 
ding-dong the same thing over and over again; that’s all you can 
say. 1)0 oil, about your linsincss.’’ 

And he throw in the second spadeful. 

.banc helcvcnt had reached that point wliere a man knows 110 lonjjer 
wnat lie is saying. 

( 3 h ! come on, and take a glass, since Fm the one to pay/^ he ao'ain 
repeated. ^ 

“When we’ve put the child to lied,” .said the gravedigerer 

He tossed in the third spadeful : then, plunging his .spade into the 
earth, he added ; 

‘*You see, now, it\s going to be cold to-night, and the dead one 
would cry out after us, if we were to plant her there without eood 
covering. ^ 

At this moment, in the act of filling his spade, the gravedicf^*er 
stooiied low, and the pocket of his vest gaped open. " 

The bewildert'd eye of lAiuchelevent rested mechanically on this 
pocket, and remained fixed. 

.1 he sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon, and there was still 
light enougli to distinguish something white in the gaping pocket. 

All tlie lightning wliich the eye of a Picardy peasant can contain 
Hashed into the pniuls of Fauchelevent. A new idea had struck him. 

Without lh(i gravedigger, who was occupied with his spadeful of 
earth, perceiving him, he slipped his hand from behind into the 
pocket, find took from him the white object it contained. 

J he gravedigger flung into tlie grave the fourth spadeful. 

Just: as he was turning to take the fifth, -Fauchelevent, looking at 
him with im|&gt;ertur!:)ahle calmness, asked : 

^‘Ry the way, my new friend, have you your card?'’ 

Hie grave&lt;Iigger stopped. 

*A¥hat card?*' 



472 LESMIS^RABLES 

“The cemetery-gate will be closed.” 

“Well, what then?” 

“Have you your card ?” 

“Oh ! my card !” said the gravedigger, and he felt in his pocket. 

Having rummaged one pocket, he tried another, i'rotn these, he 
proceeded to try his watch-fobs, e-xidoring llie tir.st, and turning the 
second inside out. 

“No !” said he, “no ! I haven’t got niy caril. 1 must have forgotten 

it.” 

“Fifteen francs fine !” said I'auchek’vent. 

The gravedigger turned green, (dreen is the prdc-ness of people 
naturally livid. 

“Oh, good-graciou.s Goil, what a fool 1 aju !” he exclaimed. “Fif-

“Three hundred-snu piwes," said I'rattchek'vent. 

The gravedigger dropped his spade. 

Fauchelevent’s turn liad come. 

“Come! come, recruit,” saiil fi'anchelevent, “never despair; 
there’s nothing to kill one.self ahont, and feed tlie worms. Fifteen 
francs are fifteen francs, ami besides, yon may not havt&gt; them to pay. 
I am an old hand, ami yon a new one. 1 know :»I1 the tricks and traps

One thing is clear — the snn is setting— and the gniveyard will be 
closed in five minutes.” 

“That’s true,” replied the gravedigger. 

“Five minute.s is not time enough for you to fill the gmve — ^it’s 
as deep as the very devil — and get out of this liefore the gale is shut.” 

“You’re right.*^ 

“In that ca.se, there is fifteen francs fine." 

“Fifteen francs !” 

“But you have time. . , . Where di t yoti live ?" 

“Just by the harriere. iufteen minutes’ walk. Number 87 Rue de 
Vaugirard,” 

“You have time, if you will hang your toggery about your tteck, to 
get out at once.” 

“'I'hat’s true.” 

“Once outside of the gate, you scamper bttnie. get y«nir rani, come 
hack, and the gatekeeper will let you in again. 1 laving your card, 
there’s notliing to pay. Then you can btiry yottr »!e',nd niftit. I'll .stay 
here, and watch him while you’re gone, to* see that he doesn’t run 
away.” 

“i owe you my life, peasant !" 

“Be ofT, then, (juick 1" said Fauchelevent. 

The gravedigger, overcome with gratitude, shotik his hands, and 
started at a nm. 

When the gravedigger had disappeared thrtnigli the bushes, 



COSETTE 473 

IFauchelevent listened until his footsteps died away, and then, bend- 
ing over the grave, called out in a low voice : 

- “Father Madeleine !” 

No answer. 

Fauchelevent shuddered. He dropped rather than clambered 
down into the grave, threw himself upon the head of the coffin, and 
cried out : 

“Are you there ?” 

Silence in the coffin. 

Fauchelevent, no longer able to breathe for the shiver that was on 
him, took his cold chisel and hammer, and wrenched off the top 
board. The face of of Jean Valjean could be seen in the twilight, his 
eyes closed and his cheeks colourless. 

Fauchelevoiit’s hair stood erect with alarm ; he rose to his feet, 
and then tottered with his back against the side of the grave, ready 
to sink down upon the coffin. He looked upon Jean Valjean. 

Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless. 

Fauchelevent murmured in a voice low as a whisper : 

“He is dead!” 

Then straightening himself, and crossing his arms so violently 
that his clenched fists sounded against his shoulders, he exclaimed : 

“This is the way I have saved him 1” 

Then the poor old man began to sob, talking aloud to himself the 
while, for it is a mistake to think that talking to one’s self is not 
natural. Powerful emotions often speak aloud. 

“It’s Father Mestienne’s fault. What did he die for, the fool? 
What was the use of going off in that way, just when no one ex- 
pected it ? It was he who killed poor M. Madeleine. Father Made- 
leine 1 He is in the coffin. He’s settled. There’s an end of it. Now, 
what’s the sense of such things ? Good God ! he’s dead ! Yes, and his 
little girl — what am I to do with h^r? What will the fruit-woman 
say ? That such a man could die in that way. Good Heaven, is it pos- 
sible ! When I think that he put himself under my cart I . . . Father 
Madeleine ! Father Madeleine ! Mercy, he’s suffocated, I said so— 
but, he wouldn’t believe me. Now, here’s a pretty piece of business} 
He’s dead — one of the very best men God ever made ; aye, the best, 
the very best ! And his little girl I I’m not going back there again. I'm 
going to stay here. To have done such a thing as this ! It’s well worth 
while to be two old greybeards, in order to be two old fools. But, to 
begin with, how did he manage to get into the convent — ^that’s where 
it started. Such things shouldn’t be done. Father Madeleine 1 Father 
Madeleine 1 Father Madeleine ! Madeleine 1 Monsieur Madeleine ! 
Monsieur Mayor ! He doesn’t hear me. Get yourself out of this now, 
if you please.” 

And he tore his hair. 



474 L E S M I S E R A B I. E S 

At a distance, through the trees, a harsh grating sound was heard. 
It was the gate of the cemetery closing. 

• Fauchelevent again bent over Jean Valjcan, but suddenly started 
back with all the recoil that was possible in a grave. Jean Valj can's 
eyes were open, and gazing at him. 

To behold death is terrifying, and to see a sudden restoration is 
nearly as much so, Fauchelevent became cold and white as a stone, 
haggard and utterly disconcerted l)y all these ]K)wer ful emotions, and 
not knowing whether he had the dead or the living to deal with, 
stared at Jean Valjean, who in turn stared at him. 

'T was falling asleep/' said Jean Valjean. 

And he rose to a sitting posture. 

Fauchelevent dropped on his knees, 

'‘Oh, blessed Virgin ! How you frighttnunl me !" 

Then, springing again to his feet, lie cried : 

“Thank you, Father Madeleine ^ ^ 

Jean Valjean had merely swooned. Tlie ojien air had revived him. 

Joy is the reflex of terror. Fauchelevenl lia&lt;l nearly as much dif- 
ficulty as Jean Valjean in coming to liimsel f . 

“Then you're not dead! Oh, what good st‘nse ytm liave! I called 
you so loudly that you got over it. When ! ^nw yon with your eyes 
shut, I said, ‘Well, there now! he s suOoeateil !’ 1 shoukl have gone 
raving mad — mad enougli for a strait-jacket. 1*ht*y’d have put me in 
the Bicetre. What would you have liad me do, if you had been dead? 
And your little girl ! the fruit-woman would have understood noth- 
ing about it ! A child plumpe&lt;l into her lap, and its grandfather dead I 
What a story to tell ! By all the .saints in lieaven, what a story ! Ah! 
but you're alive^ — that’s the best of it/' 

“I am cold," said Jean Valjean. 

These words recalled Fauchelevent comidetely to tlie real state of 
affairs, which were urgent. These two nam, vvvn when n\st&lt;&gt;red, felt, 
without knowing it, a peculiar agituiiun and a strange inward 
trouble, which was but: the sini.ster l)&lt;‘wildenm‘nl of the place. 

“Let us get away from here at t:»nce/' said baueludevent. 

Lie thrust his hand into hh pocket, and drew from it a tlask with 
which he was provi&lt;U‘d, 

“But a drop of this ftr.st !" .said he. 

The flask completed what the opcm air bad liegun, Jean Valjean 
took a swallow of brandy, and felt thorougldy ri‘store&lt;l. 

He got out of the coffin, and assisted b'audielevent to nail down the 
lid again. Three minute.s afterwards, tiu;y were out of the grave. 

After tin's, Fauchelevent was calm enoitgln He took his time. The 
cemetery was closed. There was no fear of the return of C Irihier the 
gravedigger. Iliat recruit was at home, hunting up his “car&lt;l/' and 
rather unlikely to find it, a.s it was in Fauchelevent’s txKtket. Without 
his card, he could not get back into the cemetery. 



COSETTJi 475 

Fauchelevent took the spade and Jean Valjean the pick, and to- 
gether they buried the empty coffin. 

When the grave was filled, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean : 

“Come, let us go ; I’ll keep the spade, and you take the pick.” 

Night was coming on rapidly. 

Jean Valjean found it liard to move and walk. In the coffin he had 
stiffened considerably, somewhat in reality like a corpse. The anchy- 
losis of death had seized him in that narrow wooden box. He had, in 
some sort, to thaw himself out of the sepulchre. 

“You are benumbed,” said Fauchelevent; “and what a pity that 
I’m bandy-legged, or we’d run a bit.” 

“No matter !” replied Jean Valjean, “a few steps will put my legs 
into walking order.” 

They went out by the avenues the hearse had followed. When they 
reached the closed gate and the porter’s lodge, Fauchelevent, who 
had the gravedigger’s card in his hand, dropped it into the box, the 
porter drew the cord, the gate opened, and they went through. 

“How well everything goes!” said Fauchelevent; “what a good 
plan that was of yours. Father Madeleine !” 

They passed the Bapriere Vaugirard in the easiest way in the 
world. In the neighbourhood of a graveyard, a pick and spade are 
two passports. 

The Rue de Vaugirard was deserted. 

“Father Madeleine,” said Fauchelevent, as he went along, looking 
up at the houses, “you have better eyes than mine — ^which is number 
87?” 

“Here it is, now,” said Jean Valjean. 

“There’s no one in the street,” resumed Fauchelevent. “Give me 
the pick, and wait for me a couple of minutes.” 

Faucheleventwent in at number 87, ascended to the topmost flight, 
guided by the instinct which always leads the poor to the garret, and 
knocked, in the dark, at the door of a little attic rootn. A voice called ; 

“Come in I” 

It was Gribier’s voice. 

Fauchelevent pushed open the door. The lodging of the grave- 
digger was, like all these shelters of the needy, an unfurnished but 
much littered loft. A packing-case of some kind — a, coffin, perhaps- 
supplied the place of a bureau, a straw pallet the place of a bed, a 
butter-pot the place of water-cooler, and the floor served alike for 
chairs and table. In one corner, on a ragged old scrap of carpet, was 
a haggard woman, and a number of children were huddled to|pther.' 
The whole of this wretched interior bore the traces of recent over- 
turn. One would have said that there had been an earthquake served 
up there “for one.” The coverlets were displaced, the ragged gar- 
ments scattered about,thepitcher broken, the mother had been weep- 
ing, and the children probably beaten ; all traces of a headlong and

violent search. It was plain that the gravedis'Scr hud been looking, 
wildly, for his card, and had made everything in the attic, from his 
pitcher to his wife, responsible for the loss, lie had a desperate ap- 
pearance. 

But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry for the end of his ad- 
yenture, to notice this gloomy side of his triumph. 

As he come in, he said : 

“I’ve brought your spade and pick.” _ 

Gribier looked at him with stupefaction. 

“What, it is you, peasant ?” 

“And, to-morrow morning, you will find your card with the gate- 
keeper of the cemetery.” 

And he set down the pick and the sp.a(le on the flunr. 

“What does all this mean?” asked (iril&gt;ier. 

“Why, it means that you let your card ilrnp out of your pocket; 
that I found it on the ground when you luid gone ; th:it J iniried the 
corpse; that I filled in the grave; that 1 rmisIuMl your job ; that the 
porter will give you your card, and that yi 'U will nt it hav&lt;! to pay the 
fifteen francs. That’.s what it means, recruit !" 

“Thanks, villager !” exclaimed Griiiier, in ainazcuieut. “The next 
time I will treat.”

An hour later, in the depth of niglil, two men aiul ,a child stood in 
front of No. 62, Petite Rue Piepus. 'riie ekler of tin; men lifted the 
knocker and rapped. 

It was Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, .nud Gnsette, 

The two men had gone to look for fosi-tte nt the shop of the 
fruiteressof the Ruede Chemin Vert, where luimrlieloveut had left 
her on the preceding evening. Co.sette !i:ul pavo'd tlu* twenty-four 
hours wondering what it all me, nut ami tremhliog in silence. She 
trembled so much tlutt she had not w^'jit. tjor had she tasted food nor 
slept. The worthy fruit-wonuin had asketi her a thintstmd questions 
without obtaining any other answer than .a sad look that never varied, ' 
Cosette did not let a word of all she had heard timl .seen, in the last 
two days, escaj&gt;e her. Site divined that a erinis htid conte. .She felt, in 
her very heart, that .she must he “good." Who h:ts not experienced 
the supreme effect of these two word.s prtmounml in a certain tone 
in thenar of .some little frightened creature, "l&gt;on't sjK-ak !" Fear is 
mute.lle.sitle.s, no one ever keeps a .secret so widl a.s a child. 

But when, after those mournful {uHr-and-twenty hours, .she 
again saw Jean Valjean, she uttered such a cry of joy that any 
thoughtful person hearing her would have divined in it an escape 
from some yawning gulf. 



C O S E T T E A77, 

Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew all the pass-^ 
words. Every door opened before him. 

Thus was that doubly fearful problem solved of getting out and 
getting in again. 

The porter, who had his instructions, opened the little side door 
which served to communicate between the court and the garden, and 
which, twenty years ago, could still be seen from the street, in the 
wall at the extremity of the court, facing the porte-cochere. The 
porter admitted all three by this door, and from that point they went 
to this private inner parlour, where Fauchelevent had, on the pre- 
vious evening, received the orders of the prioress. 

The prioress, rosary in hand, was awaiting them. A mother, with 
her veil down, stood near her. A modest taper lighted, or one might 
almost say, pretended to light up the parlour. 

The prioress scrutinised Jean Valjean. Nothing scans so care- 
fully as a downcast eye. 

Then she proceeded to question : 

“You are the brother ?” 

“Yes, reverend mother," replied Fauchelevent, 

“What is your name ?” 

Fauchelevent replied : 

“Ultimus Fauchelevent !” 

He had, in reality, had a brother named Ultimus, who was dead. 

“From what part of the country are you ?” 

Fauchelevent answered : 

“From Picquigny, near Amiens.” 

“What is your age ?" 

Fauchelevent answered : 

“Fifty.” 

“What is your business ?” 

Fauchelevent answered : 

“Gardener.” 

“Are you a true Christian ?” 

Fauchelevent answered : 

“All of our family are such.” 

“Is this your little girl ?” 

Fauchelevent answered : 

“Yes, reverend mother.” 

“You are her father ?” 

Fauchelevent answered ; 

“Her grandfather," 

The mother said to the prioress in an undertone: 

“He answers well.” 

Jean Valjean had not spoken a word. 

The prioress looked at Cosette attentively, and then said, aside to 
the mother— 



478 , LES MIsfiRABLES 

“She will be homely.” 

The two mothers talked together very low for a few minutes in a 
corner of the parlour, and then the prioress turned and said— 

“Father Fauvent, you will have another knee-cap and bell. We 
need two, now.” 

So, next morning, two little bells were heard tinkling in the garden, 
and the nuns could not keep from lifting a corner of their veils. They 
saw two men digging side by side, in the lower part of tlie garden 
under the trees— Fauvent and another. Immense event ! The silence 
was broken, so far as to say — 

“It’s an assistant-gardener !” 

The mothers added : 

“He is Father Fauvent’s brother.” 

In fact, Jean Valjean was regularly installed ; he had the leather 
knee-cap and the bell; henceforth he had his commission. His name 
was Ultimus Fauchelevent. 

TTie strongest recommendation for Cosette’s admission had been 
the remark of the prioress ; She mil be homely. 

■ The prioress having uttered this prediction, immediately took 
Cosette into her friendship and gave licr a place in the school build- 
ing as a charity pupil. 

There is nothing not entirely logical in this. 

It is all in vain to have no mirrors in convents ; women are con- 
scious of their own appearance ; young girls who know that they are 
pretty do not readily become nuns ; the inclination to the calling be- 
ing in inverse proportion to good looks, more is expected from the 
homely than from the handsome ones. Hence a marked preference 
for the homely. 

This whole affair elevated good old Fauchelevent greatly ; he had 
achieved a triple success in the eyes of Jean Valjean whom he had 
rescued and sheltered ; with tlie gravedigger, Gribief, who said he 
had saved him from a line ; and, at the convent, which, thanks to him, 
in retaining the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the tvltar, eluded 
Oesar and satisfied God. There was a coffin with a body in it at the 
Petit Piepus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery. 
Public order was greatly disturbed thcrelty, undoubtedly, but nobody 
perceived it. As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was 
deep. Fauchelevent became the best of servants and the most precious 
of gardeners. 

_ At the next visit of the archbishop the prioress related the affair to 
his grace, half by way of a confession and half a.s a boa‘&gt;t. 

The archbishop, on returning from the convent, sp{»ke of it ■with 
commendation and very quietly to M. de I-atil, the confessor of 
Monsieur, and, subsequently, Archbishop of Rheims and a cardinal. 
This praise and admiration for Fauchelevent traveled far, for it 
went to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then'reigning 



C O s E T T E 479 

^pe, Leo 3ai., to one of his relatives, Monsignore of the Papal 
Embassy at Pans who bore the same name as his own. Della GenL 
It contained these lines : “It seems that there is in a convent in Paris' 
an excellent prdener who is a holy man, named Fauvent ” Not a 
whisper of all this fame reached Fauchelevent in his shanty he con- 
tinued to weed and graft and cover his melon-beds without beine in 
the least aware of his excellence and holiness. He had no more sus- 
picion of his splendid reputation than any Durham or Surrey ox 
whose picture i^s published in the London Illustrated News with this 
inscription : The ox which won the premium at the cattle show.”

THE CLOSE 

psETTE, at the convent, still kept silent. She very naturally thought 
herself Jean Valjean s daughter Moreover, knowing nothing, thire 
was nothing she could tell, and then, in any case, she would not have 
told anything. As we have remarked, nothing habituates children to 
silence like misfortune. Cosette had suffered so much that she was 
afraid of everything even to speak, even to breathe. A single word 
had so often brought down an avalanche on her head! She had 
hardly begun to feel re-assured since she had been with Jean Valjean 
pe .soon became accustomed to the convent. Still, she loneed for 
pthanne, pt pred not .say so. One day, however, she said to Jean 
Valjean, If 1 had known it, father, I would have brought her with 
me. 

Cosette in ^coming a pupil at the convent, had to assume the 
dress of the school girls. Jean Valjean succeeded in having the gar- 
ments which she laid aside given to him. It was the same mourning 
smt he had earned for her to put on when she left the Thenardite 
It was not much worn. Jean Valjean rolled up these garments, as' 
well as the woollen stockings and shoes, with much camphor and 
other aromatic substances of which there is such an abundance in 
convents, and packed them in a small valise which he managed to 
procure. He put this valise in a chair near his bed, and always kept 
the key of it m his pocket • / 

“Father,” Cosette one day asked him, “what is that box there that 
smells so good ? ’ 

Fatpr Fauchelevent, besides the "glory” we have just described, 
and of which he was unconscious, was recompensed for his good 
deed ; m tU first place it made him happy, and then he had less -^rk 
to do, as It was divided. Finally, as he was very fond of tobacco, he 
ound the prts€tic^ of M, id toother point

If tho.se holy women had possessed anj^ht ol t.u* (iiMTinmiation of

was any little errand to run outside for on aei-onul of the .ttarden, it

This Veinlean assignat h.it! Wen lacked to ihc wall hy llie prcccd-

at the convent, and wlumi l''anehe1event htid succectird.

his way to be a gardener. It may be remembered that he knew aU 
kinds of receipts and secrets of field-work. These he turned to ac- 
count. Nearly all the orchard trees were wild stock ; he grafted 
and made them bear excellent fruit. 

Cosette was allowed to come every day, and pass an hour with him. 
As the sisters were melancholy, and he was kind, the child compared 
him with them, and worshipped him. Every day, at the hour ap- 
pointed, she would hun-y to the little building. When she entered the 
old place, she filled it with Paradise. Jean Valjean basked in her 
presence and felt his own happiness increase by reason of the happi- 
, ness he conferred on Cosette. The delight we inspire in others has 
this enchanting peculiarity that, far from being diminished like every 
other reflection, it returns to us more radiant than ever. At the hours 
of recreation, Jean Valjean from a distance watched her playing and 
romping, and he could distinguish her laughter from the laughter of 
the rest. 

For, now, Cosette laughed. 

Even Cosette’s countenance had, in a measure, changed. The 
gloomy cast had disappeared. Laughter is sunshine ; it chases winter 
from the human face. 

When the recreation was over and Cosette went in, Jean Valjean 
watched the windows of her schoolroom, and, at night, would rise 
from his bed to take a look at the windows of the room in which she 
slept. 

God has his own ways. The convent contributed, like Cosette, to 
confirm and complete, in Jean Valjean, the work of the bishop. It 
cannot l)e denied that one of virtue’s phases ends in pride. Therein 
is a bridge built by the Evil One. Jean Valjean was, perhaps, with- 
out knowing it, near that very phase of virtue, and that very bridge, 
when Providence flung him into the convent of the Petit Picpus. So 
long as he compared himself only with the bishop, he found himself 
unworthy and remained humble ; but, for some time past, he had been 
comparing himself with the rest of men, and pride was springing up 
in him. Who knows ? He might have finished by going gradually bade 
to hate. 

The convent stopped him on this descent. 

It was the second place of captivity he had seen. In his youth, in 
what had been for him the commencement of life, and, later, quite 
recently too, he had seen another, a frightful place, a terrible jJace, 
the severities of which had always seemed to him to be the iniquity 
of public justice and the crime of the law. Now, after having s«n the 
galleys, he saw the cloister, and reflecting that he had been an inmate 
of the galleys, and that he now was, so to spea.k, a spectator of the 
cloister, he anxiously compared them in his raeditotiems with anxiety. 

Sometimes he would lean upon his spade and descend slowly aloi^ 
the endless rounds of reverie.

He recalled his former comjjaiiiuiis, and Imw wretched they were. 
They rose at dawn and toiled until ni,iL;ht. Scarcely allowed to sleep', 
they lay on camp-beds, and were ]&gt;erinitted to have mattresses but 
two inches thick in halls which w&lt;‘re warnunl only dnrin^t;* the most 
inclement months. They were attired in hiiU^nus reel saeks, and had 
given to them, as a favour, a puiir of canvas panfah)i&gt;ns in the heats of 
midsummer, and a square of woollen stulV tti tlimw over their 
shoulders, during the bitterest frosts of wint(*r. Huy liad nt&gt; wine to

in shame. ^ 

Then, his tlioughts reverted to the beings l&gt;efore liis eyes.

On one side, robbery, fraud, iinpositinu, viiilence. In';!, iiuinicide, 
every species of sacrilege, every descrij'tion of offence ; on the other, 
one thing only,— innocence. 



COSETTE . 483 

A perfect innocence almost borne upwards in a mysterious As- 
sumption, clinging still to Earth through virtue, already touching 
Heaven through holiness. 

On the one hand, the mutual avowal of crimes detailed with bated 
breath ; on the other, faults confessed aloud. And oh ! what crimes ! 
and oh ! what faults ! 

On one side foul miasma, on the other, ineffable perfume. On the 
one side, a moral pestilence, watched day and night, held in subjec- 
tion at the cannon’s mouth, and slowly consuming its infected vic- 
tims ; on the other, chaste kindling of every soul together on the same 
hearthstone. There, utter gloom ; here, the sliadow, but a shadow full 
of light, and the light full of glowing radiations. 

Two seats of slavery ; but, in the former, rescue possible, a legal 
limit always in view, and, then, escape. In the second, perpetuity, the 
only hope at the most distant boundary of the future, that gleam of 
liberty which men call death. 

In the former, the captives were enchained by chains only ; in the 
other, they were enchained by faith alone. 

What resulted from' the first ? One vast curse, the gnashing of 
teeth, hatred, desperate depravity, a cry of rage against human 
society, .sarcasm against heaven. 

What issued from the second ? Benediction and love. 

And, in these two places, so alike and yet so different, these two 
species of beings so dissimilar were performing the same work of 
expiation. 

Jean Valjean thoroughly comprehended the expiation of the first 
personal expiation, expiation for oneself. But, he did not understand 
that of the othens, of these blameless, spotless creatures, and he 
asked himself with a tremor : "Expiation of what ? What expiation ?” 

A voice responded in his conscience : the most divine of all human 
generosity, expiation for others. 

Here we withhold all theories of our own ; we are but the narrator ; 
at Jean Valjean’s point of view we place ourselves and we merely re- 
produce his impressions. 

He had before his eyes the sublime summit of self-denial, the 
loftiest possible height of virtue ; innocence forgiving men their sins 
and expiating them in their stead; servitude endured, torture ac- 
cepted, chastisement and misery invoked by souls that had not sinned 
in order that these might not fall upon souls which had ; the love of 
humanity losing itself in the love of God, but remaining there, dis- 
tinct and suppliant ; sweet, feeble beings supporting all the torments 
of those who are punished, yet retaining the smile of those who are 
rewarded. And then he remembered that he had dared-to complain. 

Often, in the middle of the night, he would, rise from his bed to 
listen to the grateful anthem of these innocent beings thus over- 
whdmed with austeritiesi and he felt the Wood run cold in his veins 



484 L E S M I S 6 R A B L E S 

as he reflected that they who were justly punished never raised their 
voices towards Heaven excepting to blaspheme, and tiiat he, wretch 
that he was, had uplifted his clenchc&lt;l fist against Clod. 

Another strange thing which made him muse and meditate pro- 
foundly seemed like an intimation whispered in his e;ir by Provi- 
dence itself : the scaling of walls, the climbing oyer inclosures, the 
risk taken in defiance of danger or death, the diificult and painful 
ascent — ^all those very eiTorts that he had made to escape from the 
other place of expiation, he had made to enter this one. Was this an 
emblem of his destiny ? 

This house, also, was a prison, and bore dismal resemblance to the 
other from which he had fled, and yet he had never conceived any- 
thing like it. 

Pie once more saw gratings, bolts and bars of irnn-“to shut in 
whom ? Angels. 

Those lofty walls which he had seen surrounding tigens, he now 
saw encircling lambs. 

It was a place of e.xpiation, not of ptinishment ; and yet it was still 
more austere, more sombre and more jdtilcs?! than lire other. These 
virgins were more harsltly bent down than the cojivicts. har.sh, cold, 
blast, the blast that h;id frozen his youth, careered across that grated 
moat and manacled the vultures ; but a wind still more biting and 
more cruel beat upon the dove cage. 

And why ? 

When he thought (»f these things, all that was in him gave way 
before this mystery of sublimity, in these meditations, pride van- 
ished. He reverted, again and again, to himseif ; iu; felt his own 
pitiful unworthiness, and often wept. All that had oceurretl in his 
existence, for the last six months, led him l»ack towards the holy in- 
junctions of the bishop; Co.settc through love, the convent through 
humility. 

Sometimes, in the evening, aliout dusk, at the hour when the 
garden was solitary, he was seen kneeling, iii the middle of the walk 
that ran along the clmjwl, before the wiutlow through which he had 
looked, on the night of his first arrival, turueii towarfis ilie S}K)t where 
he knew that the sister who wa.s performing the reparation was pros- 
trate in prayer. Thus he prayed kneeling before this sister. 

It seemed as thottgh he dared not knee! directly before (lad. 

Everything around him, this quiet garden, thwe balmy flowers, 
thpe children, shouting with joy, these meek and siinpk* women, 
this silent cloister, gradually entered into all his being, and, little by 
little, his soul subsided into silence like this cloister, Into fragrance 
like these flowers, into jieace like this garden, into simplicity like 
these women, into joy like these children. And then he reflected that 
two bouses of God had received him in succession at the two critical 
moments of his life, the first when every door wm ckaed and human 



COSETTE . 485 

society repelled him ; the second, when human society again howled 
upon his track, and the galleys once more gaped for him ; and that, 
had it not been for the first, he should have fallen back into crime, 
and had it not been for the second, into punishment. 

His whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more, 
Several years passed thus. Cosette was growing.

BOOK FIRST— PARIS ATOMISED 
I 


PARVULUS 

Paris has a child, and the forest has a bird ; the bird is called the 
sparrow ; the child is called the gamin. 

Couple these two ideas, the one containing all the heat of the fur* 
nace, the other all the light of the dawn ; strike together these two 
sparks, Paris and infancy; and there leaps forth from them a little 
creature, Homtmcto, Plautus would say. 

This little creature is full of joy. He has not food to eat every day,, 
yet he goes to the show every evening, if he sees fit. He has no shirt 
to his back, no shoes to his feet, no roof over his head ; he is like the 
flies in the air who have none of all these things. He is from seven 
to thirteen years of age, lives in troops, ranges the streets, sleeps in 
the open air, wears an old pair of his father’s pantaloons down about 
his heels, an oUI hat of some other father, which covers his ears, and 
a single .staspender of yellow li.sting, run.s about, is alvrays on the 
watch and on the search, kills time, colours pipes, swears like an imp, 
hangs about the wine-shop, knows thieves and robbers, is hand in 
glove with the street-girls, rattles off slang, sings smutty songs, and, 
withal, has nothing bad in his heart. This is because he has a pearl in 
his soul, innocence ; and pearls do not dissolve in mire. So long as 
man is a child, God wills that he be innocent. 

I f one could ask of this vast city : what is that creature ? She would 
answer : “it is my bantling.”

The of Paris is the dwarf of the giantess. s 

We will not exaggerate. This cherub of the gutter sometimes has 
a shirt, but then he has only one ; sometimes he has shoes, but iduea 
they have no soles ; smnetimes he has a sheltw, and he kwes it, for 
there he finds his mother ; but he prefers the street fw there he finds 
tus liber^. He has sports of his own, roguish tridcs of his own, of 
which a hearty Imtred of the bdurgeois is the basis ; he has his, CKwiti

creature on wings and sailing through the air.. It is enough for biin 
to be there with his radiance of delight, his fulness of enthusiasm 
and joy, and his clapping of hands like the clapping of wings, to m jke 
that hold, close, dark, foetid, filthy, unwholesome, hideous, and de- 
testable, as it is, a very Paradise. 

Give to a being the useless, and deprive him of the needful, and 
you have the gamin. 

The gamin is not without a certain inclination towards literature. 
His tendency, however— -we say it with the befitting quantum of 
regret — would not be considered as towards the classic. He is, in hia 
nature, but slightly academic. For instance, the popularity of 
Mademoiselle Mars among this little public of children was spicecj 
with a touch of irony. The gamin called her Mademoiselle Muche, 

This being jeers, wrangles, sneers, jangles, has frippery like a 
baby and rags like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in the 
drain, extracts gaiety from filth, lashes the street corners with his 
wit, fleers and bites, hisses and sings, applauds and hoots, tempera 
Hallelujah with turalural, psalmodises all sorts of rhythms from 
De Profundis to the Chie-en-lit, finds without searching, knows 
what he does not know, is Spartan even to roguery, is witless even 
to wisdom, is lyric even to impurity, would squat upon Olympus, 
wallows in the dung-heap and comes out of it covered with stars. 
The gamin of Paris is an urchin Rabelais. 

He is never satisfied with his pantaloons unless they have a watch, 
fob. 

He is seldom astonished, is frightened still less frequently, turns 
superstitions into doggerel verses and sings them, collapses exag- 
gerations, makes light of mysteries, sticks out his tongue at ghosts, 
dismounts everj^thing that is on stilts, and introduces caricature into 
all epic pomposities. This is not because he is prosaic, far from it; 
but he substitutes the phantasmagoria of fun for solemn dreaifis. 
Were Adamaster to appear to him, he would shout out : “Hallo, there, 
old Bug-a-boo I” 

IV 

HE MAY BE USEFUL 

Paris begins with the cockney and ends with the gamin, two beings 
of which no other city is capable ; passive acceptation satisfied with 
merely looking on, and exhaustless enterprise; Prudhomme and 
Fouillou. Paris_ alone comprises this in its natural history. All mon- 
archy is comprised in the cockney ; all anarchy.in tht gamin. 

This pale child of the Paris suburbs lives, develops, and gets into 
and out of “scrapes," amid suffering, a thoughtful witness of our 
social realities and our human problems. He thinks himself careless, 
but he is not. He looks onr, ready to laugh ; ready, also, for something

bathed in sunshine and alive with butterflies — all these attracted him. 

There is hardly anybody but knows those singular places, the 
Glaciere, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Crenelle spotted with balls, 
the Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, the white hazel trees ori 
the high banks of the_ Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the 
Pierre Plate de Chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry 
which is of no further use but as a place for the growth of mush- 
rooms, and is closed on a level with the ground by a trap-door of 
rottp boards. The Campagna of Rome is one idea; the banlieue of 
Paris is another ; to see in whatever forms our horizon, nothing but 
fields, houses, or trees, is to be but superficial ; all the aspects of 
things are thoughts of God. The place where an open plain adjoins a 
city always bears the impress of some indescribable, penetrating 
melancholy. There, nature and humanity address you at one and the 
same moment. There, the originalities of place appear. 

He who, like ourselves, has rambled through these solitudes con- 
tiguous to our suburbs, which one might term the limbo of Paris, has 
noticed dotted about, here and there, always in the most deserted 
spot and at the most unexpected moment, beside some straggling 
hedge or in the corner of some dismal wall, little helter-skelter groups 
of children, filthy, muddy, dusty, uncombed, dishevelled, playing 
mumble-peg crowned with violets. These are all the runaway chil- 
dren of poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing 
medium, and the banlieue belongs to them. There, they play truant, 
continually. There they sing, innocently, their coUection’of low songs. 
They are, or rather, they live there, far from every eye, in the soft 
radiance of May or June, kneeling around a hole in the ground, play- 
ing marbles, squabbling for pennies, irresponsible, birds flown, let 
loose and happy ; and, the moment they see you, remembering that 
they have a trade and must make their living, they oflFer to sell you 
an old woollen stocking full of May-bugs, or a bunch of lilacs. These 
meetings with strange children are among the seductive but at the 
same time saddening charms of the environs of Paris. 

Sometimes among this crowd of boys, there are a few little girls 
-^re they their sisters? — ^almost young women, thin, feverish, 
freckled, gloved with sunburn, with head-dresses of rye-straw and 
poppies, gay, wild, barefooted. Some of them are seen eating cherries 
among the growing grain. In the evening, they are heard laughing. 
These |;roups, warmly lighted up by the full blaze of noon-day, or 
seen dimly in the twilight, long occupy the attention of the dreamer, 
and these visions mingle with his reveries, 

Paris, the centre ; the banlieue, the circumference ; to these chil- 
dfeti, this is the whole world. They never venture beyond it. They 
can no more live out of the atmosphere of Paris than fish can live out 
of water. To them, beyond two leagues from flie barri^es there is 
nothing more, Iviy, Gentilly, Belleville, Aubervilliers.

A SCRi\r OF HISTORY 

At the period, although it is almost contemporaneous, in which the 
action of this story is laid, there was not, as there now is, a police 
officer at every street-corner (an advantage we liavc no time to en- 
large upon) ; truant children abounded in Paris. 'I'he statistics gave 
an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children, picked up 
annually by the police on their rounds, in 0|)en lots, in lunises in 
process of building, and under the arclu's of liritlges. One of these 
nests, which continues famous, i)roduced “ tlie swalli iws of the bridge 
of Areola.” This, moreover, is the most disastrous of our social 
syniptoms. All the crimes of man begin with the vagrauev of child- 
hood. 

We imust except Paris, however. 'I'o a considerable tlegrce, and 
notwith-standing the reminiscence we h.ave. just recalkal. tiie. e.xcep- 
tion is jinst. While in every other city, the truant boy is the lost man; 
while, almost everywhere, the boy 'given up to himstdf is, in some 
sort, devoted and abandoned to a speei&lt;‘s of fatal immersion in public 
vices which cat out of him all th:it is r(!spt-elable, even conscience 
itself, gamin of Paris, we must insist, chippetl and spotted as he 
is on the surface, is almost intact within. A thing magtiificcnt to 
think of, and one that shines forth resplen&lt;leutly in the glorious 
probity of our popular revolutions ; a certain incorruptibility results 
from the mental fluid which is to the air of Paris what salt'is to the 
water of the ocean. To breathe the air of Paris preservtrs the soul. 

What we here .say alleviates, in no resjH'ct, that jiang of tlic heart 
which we feel whenever we meet one of these children, around whom 
we seem to see floating the broken ties f»f the disrupted ftunily. In 
our present civilisation, which is still so incomplete, it is not a'^very 
abnormal thing to find these disruptions of families, separating in 
the darkness, .scarcely knowing what has beconie of their children— 
dropping fragments of their life, as it were, upon the pultlk high- 
way. Hence arise dark dcstinitvs. 'I'his is calletl, for the sad chance 
has coined its own expression, “being east upon the iiavenient of 
Paris.” 

These abandonments of children, lie it said, in jiassing. were not 
di.scouraged by the old monarchy. A little of Egyirt and of Bohemia 
in the lower strata, accommoilated the higher spheres, and answered 
the purpose of the powerful. Hatred to the instruction of the children 



MARIUS ^-95 

of the people was a dogma. What was the use of “a little learning 
Such was the password. Now the truant child is the corollary of the 
ignorant child. Moreover, the monarchy sometimes had need of 
children, and then it skimmed the street. 

Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king, very 
wisely, desired to build up a navy. The idea was a good one. But let 
us look at the means. No navy could there be, if, side by side with the 
sailing vessel, the sport of the wind, to tow it along, in case of need, 
there were not another vessel capable of going where it nleased, 
either by the oar or by steam ; the galleys were to the navy, then, 
what steamers now are. Hence, there must be galleys ; but galleys 
could be moved only by galley-slaves, and therefore there must be 
galley-slaves. Colbert, through the provincial intendants and the 
parlements, made as many galley-slaves as possible. The magistracy 
set about the work with good heart. A man kept his hat on before a 
procession, a Huguenot attitude ; he was sent to the galleys. A boy 
was found in the street ; if he had no place to sleep in, and was fifteen 
years old, he was sent to the galleys. Great reign, great age. 

Under Louis XV, children disapi^eared in Paris ; the police carried 
them off — nobody knows for what mysterious use. People whispered 
with affright horrible conjectures about the purple baths of the king. 
Barbier speaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened 
that the officers, running short of children, took some who had 
fathers. The fathers, in despair, rushed upon the officers. In such 
cases, the parlement interfered and hung — ^whoni ? The officers ? No ; 
the fathers. 


VII 

THE GAMIN WILL ITAVE HIS PLACE AMONG THE 
CLASSIFICATIONS OF INDIA 

The Parision order of gamins is almost a caste. One might say: 
nobody wants to have anything to do with them. 

This word gamin was printed for the first time, and passed from 
the popular language into that of literature, in 1834. It was in a little 
work entitled Claitde Gueux that the word first appeared. It created 
a great uproar. The word was adopted. 

The elements that go to make up respectability among the gamins 
are very varied. We knew and had to do with one who was greatly 
respected and admired, because he had seen a man fall from the 
towers of Notre Dame ; another, because he had succeeded in making 
his way into the rear inclosure where the statues intended for the 
dome of the Invalides were deposited, and had scraped off some of 
the lead ; a third, because he had seen a diligence upset ; and still an- 
other, because he knew a soldier who had almost knocked out the eye 
of a bourgeois.

This explains that odd exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a depth 
of lamentation which the multitude laugh at without comprehending. 
"Oh, Lordy, Lardy ! a’nt I unlucky ! only ihink I never even saw any- 
body fall from a fifth story,-"— tha words pronounced with an inex- 
pressible twang of his own. 

What a rich saying for a peasant was this ! “Father so-and-so, your 
wife’s illness has killed her; why didn’t you send for a doctor?” 
“What are you thinking about, friend?” says the other. “Why, we 
poor people we haves to die ourselves." But, if all the passiveness of ■, 
the peasant is found in this saying, all the rollidcing anarchy of the 
urchin of the suburbs is contained in the following : — A i&gt;oor w’retch 
on his way to the gallows was listening to his confessor, who sat be- 
side him in the cart. A Paris boy shouted out : "He’s talking to his 
long-gown. Oh, the sniveller 

A certain audacity in religious matters sets oit the gamin. It is a 
great thing to be strong-minded. 

To be present at executions is a positive duly. 'Phese imps point at 
the guillotine and laugh. They give it all kinds of nicknames ; “End 
of the Soup” — “Old Growler” — ^“Sky-Mother” — “'I'he l.,ast Mouth- 
ful,” etc., etc. That they may lose nothing of the sight, llu'j' scale 
walls, hang on to balconies, climb trees, swing to gratings, crouch, 
into chimneys. The gamin is a born .skitcr as he is a born sailor. A 
roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast. No f est ival is equal 
to the execution-ground, — La Greve. Stimson aixl the Abbe Montes 
are the really popular names. They .shout to the victim to encourage 
him. Sometimes, they admire him. The r/ff »(/H_I«acenaire, seeing the 
horrible Dautun die bravely, used an exiwession which was full of 
future: “/ was jcalotis of him!" In the order of gamins Voltaire is 
unknown, but they are acquainted with Papavoine. 'Phey mingle in 
the same recital, “the politicals” with murth'rcrs. They have tradi- 
tions of the last clothes worn'by them all. They know that Tolleron 
had on a forgeman’s cap, and that Avril wore one of otter skin ; that 
Louvel had on a round hat. that old Delaporte was bald and bare- 
headed, that Castaing was ruddy and good-looking, that Borte had 
a sweet little beard, that Jean Martin kejrt on his .susiHuiders, and 
that Lecouflf6 and his mother quarrt“!lc&lt;I. Don't be finding fault now 
with your basket, shouted a gamin to the latter couple. Another, to - 
see Debacker pass, being too short in the crowd, began to climb a 
lamp-post on the quay. A gendarme on that beat .scowled at him. “Let 
me get up, Mister Gendarme,” said the gamin. And then, to soften 
the official, he added: "I won't fall," “Little clo I care about your 
falling,” replied the gendarme. 

In the order of gamins, a memorable accident is greatly prized. 
One of their number reaches the very pinnacle of {listinction, if he 
happen to cut himself badly, “into the hone,” as they say. 

The fist is by no means an itiferior element of respect. One of the 



MARIUS 497 

things the gamin is fondest of saying is, “I’m Jolly strong, I am !” 
To be left-lianded makes you an object of envy. Squinting is highly 
esteemed. 

VIII 

IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND A CHARMING PLEASANTRY 
OF THE LATE KING 

In summer, he transforms himself into a frog ; and in the evening, 
at nightfall, opposite the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena, from the 
coal rafts and washerwomen’s boats,_he plunges head-foremost into 
the Seine, and into all sorts of infractions of the laws of modesty and 
the police. However, the policemen are on the look-out, and there re- 
sults from this circumstance a highly dramatic situation which, upon 
one occasion, gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry. This cry, 
which was quite famous about 1830, is a strategic signal from gamin 
to gamin; it is scanned like a verse of Homer, with a style of notation 
almost as inexplicable as the Eleusinian melody of the Panathenaeans, 
recalling once more the ancient “Evohe!” It is as follows: “OMl 
Titi, 6h6! lookee yonder! they’re cornin’ to ketch ye! Grab yer clothes 
and cut through the drain!” 

Sometimes this gnat — it is thus that he styles himself — can read ; 
sometimes he can write ; he always knows how to scrawl. He gets by 
some unknown and mysterious mutual instruction, all talents which 
may be useful in public affairs ; from 181S to 1830, he imitated the 
call of the turkey ; from 1830 to 1848, he scratched a pear on the 
walls. One summer evening, Louis Philippe returning to the palace 
on foot, saw one of them, a little fellow, so high, sweating and stretch- 
ing upon tiptoe, to make a charcoal sketch of a gigantic pear, on one 
of the pillars of the Neuilly gateway ; the king, with that good nature 
which he inherited from l-lenry IV., helped the boy, completed the 
pear, and gave the youngster a gold Louis, saying : "’The pear’s on 
that too !” The gamin loves uproar. Violence and noise please him. 
He execrates “the” cures. One day, in the Rue de TUniversite, one 
of these young scamps was making faces at the porte-cochere of No. 
69. “Why are you doing that at this door?” asked a passer-by. The 
boy replied : “There’s a cur6 there.” It was, in fact, the residence of 
the Papal Nuncio. Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairian 
tendencies of the gamin, should an occasion present itself to become 
a choir-boy, he 'would, very likely, accept, and in such case would 
serve the mass properly. There are two things of which he is the 
Tantalus, which he is always wishing for, but never attains — ^to over- 
throw the government, and to get his trousers mended. 

The gamin, in his perfect state, possesses all the policemen of 
Paris, and, always, upon meeting one, can put a name to the counte- 
nance. He counts them off on his fingers. He studies their ways, and 



498 L E s M 1 S E R A » I- K S 

has special notes of his own upon each one of them. He reads their 
souls as an open book. He will tell you oll-luind and wiihout hesitat- 
ing—Such a one is a traitor; such a one is very cross; such a one is 
great, such a one is ridiculous; (till tliese cxpn'ssions. traitor, cross, 
great and ridiculous, have in his mouth a peculiar .siguilication) — . 
“That chap thinks the Poiit Neuf belongs to him, and hinders people 
from walking on the cornice outsiuc of the pauipels j that other one 
has a mania for pulling persons’ ears etc. etc.

THE ANCIENT SOUL OF OAIJI. 

There was .something of this urchin in I’oquelin, the son of tlie 
market-place; tliere was something of him in ileaunuuchms. The 
gamin style of life is a .shade of the t'.allic mind. .Mitiided witli good 
sense, it sometimes gives it addition.al strength, ;i;. alculml does to 
wine. Sometimes, it is a defect : 1 lumer nods ; one might say Xhiludre 
plays gamin. Camille De.smoulins was a snhmhan. Chajufiionnet, 
who brutalised miracles, was a child of the Paris streets; he had 
when a little boy besprinkled the porticoes of St. Jean tie Ileauvais 
and St. Etienne du Mont; he h:«l chatted with the shrine of St. 
Genevieve enough to throw into convulsions the s.acred vial of .St. 
Jannarius. 

The Paris gamin is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He has bad 
teeth, because he is poorly fed, and his stomacli .•.’.itt'crs, .and fine eyes 
because he has genius. Iii thi; very presence o j Jehovah, he would go 
hopping and jumping up the .steps of Paradise. He is vtiry goofi at 
boxing with both katids :md feet. Every description of growth is pas- 
sible to him. He pla 3 's in the gutter and rises front it by revolt :Jus 
effrontery is not cured by grape; he \v;ts a hlacUguard, lo! be is a 
hero ! like the little Thehan. he shakes the lit tii's skin ; ! larra the drum- 
mer was a Paris gamin; Ite shouts “h'orvv.trt! 1" as the eharger of 
Holy XVrit s.at^s “Ha! ha!" and in a itiometit, he passes frttm the 
urcliin to the giant. 

This child of the gutter is, also, tlie child of the itleai. Measure 
thissweepof wing which reaches from Moliere to P.;u!,'i. 

As sum total, and to etnhrace all in .a work!, tlie gamin is it being 
who amuses himself beciiusc he is unforltinale. 

X 

KCCE PARIS, EtTK UUSIO 

To sum Up all once more, the gamin ol Paris of the pre,seut day, is as 
the greecuhts ol Rome was in ancient times, the jjeople as a child, 
witli tl\e wrinkles of the old work, mi its brow. 



MARIUS 499 

The gamin is a beauty and, at the same time, a disease of the na- 
tion — a disease that must be cured. How ? By light. 

Light makes whole. 

Light enlightens. 

All the generous irradiations of society spring from science, 
letters, the arts, and instruction. Make men, make men. Give them 
light, that they may give you warmth. Soon or late, the splendid ques- 
tion of universal instruction will take its position with the irresistible 
authority of absolute truth ; and then those who govern under the 
superintendence of the French idea will have to make this choice: 
the children of France or the gamins of Paris ; flames in the light or 
will o’ the wisps in the gloom. 

The gamin is the expression of Paris, and Paris is the expression 
of the world. 

jH’or Paris is a sum total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. All 
this prodigious city is an epitome of dead and living manners and 
customs. He who sees Paris, seems to see all history through with sky 
and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a Capitol, the Hotel de 
Ville ; a Pai-thenon, Notre Dame ; a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg 
St. Antoine; an Asinarium, the Sorbonne; a Pantheon, the Pan- 
theon; a Via Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens; a tower of the 
Winds ; public opinion— and supplies the place of the Gemonite by 
ridicule, li&amp; majo is the “faraud,” its Trasteverino is the suburban; 
its hammal is the strong man of the market-place ; its lassarone is the 
pegre ; its cockney is the gandin. All that can be found anywhere can 
be found in Paris. The fish-woman of Dumarsais can hold her own 
with the herb-woman of Euripides, the discobolus Vejanus lives 
again in Forioso the rope-dancer, Therapontigonus Miles might go 
arm in arm with the grenadier Vadeboncoeur, Damasippus the curi- 
osity broker would be happy among the did curipsity shops, Vin- 
cenne.s_would_lay hold of Socrates just as the whole Agora would 
clap Diderot into a strong box ; Grimod de la Reyniere discovered 
roast-beef cooked with its own fat as Curtillus had invented roast 
hedgehog ; we see, again; under the balloon of the Arc de I’Etoile the 
trapezium mentioned in Plautus ; the sword-eater of the Poecilium 
met with by Apuleius is the swallower of sabres on the Pont-Neuf ; 
the nephew of Rameau and Curculion the parasite form a pair; 
Ergasilus would get himself presented to Cambaceres by d’Aigre- 
feuille ; the four dandies of Rome, Alcesimarchus, Phoedromus, 
Diabolus, and Argyrippe, may be seen going down la Courtille in 
the Labutat post-coach ; Aulus Gellius did not stop longer in front 
of Congrio than Charles Nodier before Punch and Judy; Marton is 
not a tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the buf- 
foon chaffs Nomentanus the fast-liver at the Caf6 Anglais ; Her- 
mogenus is a tenor in the Champs Elys6eSj and, around him, Thrasius 
tiie beggar in the costume of Bob^che plies his trade ; the bore who

buttonholes you in the Tuileries makes yon repeat, after the lapse 
of two thousand years, the apostrophe of 'riiesprion : qiiis proper- 
anlcm me prehendit pallio? The wine of Snrene parodies the wine of 
Alba; the red rim of Desaugiers halunces tlu; huge golilet of Bala- 
tron, Pere Lachaise e.xhales, under the noclunud niius, the same 
lurid emanations that were seen in the hisfinilies, and the grave of 
the poor purchased for five years, is about the etpii valent of the hired 
coffin of the slave. 

Ransack your memory for something which Pans has not. The 
vat of Trophonius contains nothing that is not in the washtub of 
Mesnier; Ergaphilas is resascitated in fagliustro ; the Brahmin 
Vasaiihanta is in the ile.sh again in the Count Saint tiermain; the 
cemetery of St. Medard turns out &lt;iuile as good miracles as the 
Oumoumic mosque at Dtimascus. 

Paris has an /Ksop in Mayeux, and :i Canidia in Mademoiselle 
Lenormand, It stands aghast like Dclphos at the blinding realities of 
visions ; it tips tables as Dodona did tripods, It enthrones the grisette 
as Rome did the courtesan ; and, in fine, if 1 .miis X V. is worse than 
Claudius, Madame Dnharry is heller than .M essalina. Paris comhines 
in one wonderful tpye which has hiul real existence, and actually 
elbowed us, the Creek nudity, the 1 lehrew ulcer, the ( lasenm jest It 
mingles Diogcne.s, Job, and Paillasse, dresses np a ghost in old 
numhers of the Conxiituliimiiel, and pnuiuces .Shatlrac Ihielos, 

Althotigh Plutarclt may .say: thjy/ynrid neftr iii'nnexidtl, Rome, 
under Sylla as well as under Domilian, resigned herself tind of her 
own accord put water in her wine. Tlu‘ Tiller was a 1 .ethe, i f we may 
believe the somewhat doctrinal eulogy prououiieed npitn it by Varus 
Vibi.scus: Conlnt (irarchos Tiherim hiht mHS, J^ihi re ’I'ibmin, id 
est seditiomm ohlkdsd, Paris ilrinks :i qittirler of !i million of gal- 
lons of water per &lt;lay, hut that does not, priweiit it ui«tti ocettsion 
from heating the alarm and sonttding tlie tocsin. 

With till tliaf, Paris is a good soul. It aceejits everything right 
royally ; it is not difficult in tlie realms of \‘cims ; its ( ‘allipyge is of 
the Hottentot .stamii; if it hut laughs, it pardoit-f, ugliness makes it 
merry ; deformity puts it in good Inuuour, vice diverts its attention; 
be droll and you ntay venture to lie a scamp : even liypocrisy, that 
sulilimity of cynicism, it does not revolt al ; it is .so literary that it 
docs not hold its nose over Basilius, and is no mon! slioeked at the 
prayer of TartulTe than Horace was at the hieemigh of Priapus, No 
feature of the universal countenance is waiiiitig in the profile of 
Paris, 'fhe Mahile dancing garden i.s not the polyhynniian dance of 
the Janiculum, Imt the costume-hirer devours the lort-lle there with 
her eyes extictly a.s the proctiress Staphyla watched the virgin 
Plane.sium. The Rarrifre d« Combat is not a Coliseum, liut there is 
as much ferocity exhihiteti as though tiw.sar were a spectator. The 
Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil 



MARIUS 501 

haunted the Roman wine-shop, David d’Angers, Balzac, and Charlet 
have sat down in the drinking-places of Paris. Paris « is regnant 
Geniuses blaze on all sides, and red perukes flourish. Adonais passes 
by in his twelve- wheeled car of thunder and lightning; Silenus 
makes his entry upon his tun. For Silenus read Ramponneau, 

Paris is a synonym of Cosmos. Paris is Athens, Rome, Sybaris, 
Jerusalem, Pantin, All the eras of civilisation are there in abridged 
edition, all the epochs of barbarism also. Paris would be greatly 
vexed, had she no guillotine. 

A small admixture of the Place de Greve is good. What would 
all this continual meiTymaking be without that seasoning ? Our laws 
have wisely provided for this, and, thanks to them, this relish turns 
its edge upon the general carnival. 


XI 

RIDICULE AND REIGN 

Of bounds and limits, Paris .has none. No other city ever enjoyed 
that supreme control which sometimes derides those whom it re- 
duces to submission. To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alex- 
ander. Paris does more than, lay down the law ; it lays down the fash- 
ion ; Paris does more than lay down the fashion ; it lays down the 
routine. Paris may be stupid if it please ; sometimes it allows itself 
this luxury ; then, the whole universe is stupid with it. Upon this, 
Paris awakes, rubs its eyes, and says : “Am I stupid !*’ and bursts 
out laughing in the face of mankind. What a, marvel is such a city! 
how strange a thing that all this mass of what is grand and what is 
ludicrous should be so harmonious, that all this majesty is not dis- 
turbed by all this parody, and that the same mouth can to-day blo^/» 
the trump of the last judgment and to-morrow a penny^ whistle; 
Paris possesses an all-commanding joviality. Its gaiety is of the 
thunderbolt, and its frolicking holds a sceptre. Its hurricanes spring 
sometimes from a wry face. Its outbursts, its great day-s, its master- 
pieces, its prodigies, its epics fly to the ends of the universe, and so 
do its cock and bull stories also. Its laughter is the mouth of a vol- 
cano that bespatters the whole earth. Its jokes are sparks that kindle. 
It forces upon the nations its caricatures as well as its ideal; the 
loftiest monuments of human civilisation accept it^ sarcasms and 
lend their eternity to its waggeries. It is superb ; it has a marvellous 
Fourteenth of July that delivers the globe; it makes all the nations 
take the oath of the tennis-court ; its night of the Fourth of August 
disperses in three hours a thousand years of feudalism ; it makes of 
its logic the muscle of the unanimous mil ; it multiplies itself under 
all the forms of the sublime ; it fills with its radianj^ij^^S^^t^pote

breath impels, that Byron dies at Missolonghi. and .Miizet at Barce-

its literature, its philosophy arc the manuals of the human race; to

taire for every moment, Moliere for every century ; it makes the uni- 
versal mouth speak its langua.ge, atid that language becomes the 
Word ; it builds up in every mind the idea of progress ; the liberating 
dogmas which it forges arc swords Iry the pillows of the generations, 
and with the soul of its thinkers and’ poets have all the lieroes of all 
nations since 1789 been made; hut that doesimt i&gt;reveut it from play-

transfiguring the world with its radiance, draws the nose of llougi- 
nier in charcoal on the wall of the 'I’emple of 'riiescus, and writes 
Cridcvillc the robber on the Pyramicls. 

Paris is always showing its tectlt ; when it is not Hcoldin,g, it is 
laughing. 

buch is Paris. The smoke of it.s roofs is the ideas of the universe. 
A heap of mud and stone, if you will, hut above all, a moral being 
It is more than great, it is immense. Why? llecause it dares. 

To dare ; progress is at this price. 

All sublime conquests are, more or less, the rewards of daring. 
That the revolution should come, it was not enough tit, at Monte.s- 
quieu .should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, that Beaumar- 
chais should announce it, that Condorcet should ealcukUe it, that 
Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau .should jtreuuslitale it ; Dan- 
ton must dare it. 

That cry, "Attdacc,’' is a Pkt Lux! I'he onward march of the 
human race require.s that the heights arountl it should he ablaze with 
noble and enduring lessons of courage, De(&gt;d.s of daring dazzle his-

when it rises. To strive, to brave all risks, to per.sist, to persevere, to 
be faithful to yourself, to grapple hand to hand with clestitiy, to sur- 
prise defeat by the little terror it inspires, at tme time to confront un- 
righteous power, at another to defy intoxicated triumph, to hold 
fast, to hold hard— -.such is the example which t!ie nations need, and 
the light that electrifies tltem. The same puissant lightning darts

THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE 

As to the people of Paris, even when grown to manhood, it is, always, 
the gamin; to depict the child is to depict the city, and therefore it 
is that we have studied this eagle in this open-hearted sparrow. 

It is in the suburbs especially, we insist, that the Parisian race is 
found ; there is the pure blood ; there is the true physiognomy ; there 
this people works and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two 
forms of men. There are vast numbers of unknown beings teeming 
with the strangest types of humanity, from the stevedore of the 
Rapee to the horsekiller of Montfaucon. Fex urhis, exclaims Cicero ; 
mob, adds the indignant Burke ; the herd, the multitude, the populace. 
Those words are quickly said. But if it be so, what matters it ? "V^at 
is it tp me that they go barefoot? They cannot read. So much the 
worse. Will you abandon them for that? Would you make their 
misfortune their curse? Cannot the light penetrate these masses? 
Let us return to that cry: Light! and let us persist in it! Light! 
light! Who knows but that these opacities will become trans- 
parent ? are not revolutions transfigurations ? Proceed, philosophers, 
teach, enlighten, enkindle, think aloud, speak aloud, run joyously 
towards the broad_ daylight, fraternise in the public squares, an- 
nounce the glad tidings, scatter plenteously your alphabets, proclaim 
human rights, sing your Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms Isroadcast, 
tear off green branches from the oak-trees. Make thought a whirl- 
wind. This multitude can be sublimated. Let us learn to avail our- 
selves ofJ:his vast combustion of principles and virtues, which spark- 
les, crackles, and thrills' at' certain periods. Thes^ bare feet, these 
naked arms, these rags, these shades of ignorance, these depths of 
abjectness, these abysses of gloom may be employed in the conquest 
of the ideal. Look through the medium of the people, and you shall 
discern the truth. This lowly sand which you trample beneath your 
feet, if you cast it into the furnace, and let it melt and seethe, shall 
become resplendent crystal, and by means of such as it a Galileo and 
a Newton shall discover stars.

, LITTLE GAVROCHE 

About eight or nine years after the events narrated invthe second 
part of this story, there was seen, on the Boulevard do Temple, and 
in the neighbourhood of the ChSteau d’Eau, a little boy-of eleven or 
twelve years of sgc, who would have realised with considerable ac- 



504 LES MIS^RABLES 

curacy the ideal of the gamin previously sketched, if, with the 
laughter of his youth upon his lips, his heart had not been absolutely 
dark and empty. This child was well miviTled up in a man’s pair of 
pantaloons, but he had not got them froin his father, and in a wo- 
man’s chemise, which was not an inheritance from his mother. 
Strangers had clothed him in these rags out of charity. Still, he had 
a father and a mother. But his father never thouglit of him, and his 
mother did not love him. He was one of those children so deserving 
of pity from all, who have fathers and mothers, and j-et are orphans. 

This little boy never felt so happy as when in the street. The pave- 
ment was not so hard to him as the heart of his mother. 

His parents had thrown him out into li f e with a kick. 

He had quite ingenuously spread his wings, and taken flight. 

He was a boisterous, pallid, niinl)]e, wide-awake, roguish urchin, 
with an air at once vivacious and sickly. He went, came, sang, played 
pitch and toss, scraped the gutters, stole a little, but he did it gaily, 
like the cats and the sparrows, laughed when peoide called him an 
errand-boy, and got angry when they called him a raganiuffm. He 
had no shelter, no food, no fire, no love, but he was light-hearted be- 
cause he was free. 

When these poor creatures are men, the millstcme of our social 
system almost always comes in contact with them, and grinds them, 
but while they are children they escape liccause they arc little. The 
smallest hole saves them. 

However, deserted as this lad was, it happened sometimes, every 
two or three months, that he would say to himself : “Come, I’ll go 
and see my mother 1” Then he would leave the Boulcvtird, the Cir- 
que, the Porte Saint Martin, go down along the quays, cross the 
bridges, reach the suburbs, walk as far as tlie Sal]X'triere, and arrive 
— where ? Precisely at that double nunibc r, 50-52, which is known to 
the reader, the Gorbeau building. 

At the period referred to, the tenement No. 50-52, usually empty, 
and permanently decorated with the placard ’tRooms to let,” was, 
for a wonder, tenanted by several persons who, in all other respects, 
as is always the case at Paris, had no relation to or connection with 
each other. They all belonged to that indigent class which begins 
with the small bourgeois in embarrassed circumstances, and de- 
scends, from grade to grade of wrefehedness, through the lower 
strata of society, until it reaches those two beings in whom all the 
material things of civili-sation terminate, the scavenger and the rag- 
picker. 

The “landlady” of the time of Jean Valjcaii was dead, and had 
been replaced by another exactly like her, I do not remem!&gt;er what 
philosopher it was who said ; “There is never any lack of old wo- 
men.” 

The new old woman was called Madame Burgon, and her life had 



MARIUS 505 

been remarkable for nothing except a dynasty of three paroquets, 
which had in succession wielded the sceptre of her affections. 

Among those who lived in the building, the wretchedest of all 
Virere a family of four persons, father, mother, and two daughters 
nearly grown, all four lodging in the same garret room, one of those 
cells of which we have already spoken. 

This family at first sight presented nothing very peculiar but its 
extreme destitution ; the father, in renting the room, had given his 
name as Jondrette. Some time after his moving in, which had singu- 
larly resembled, to borrow the memorable expression of the land- 
lady, the entrance of nothing at all, this Jondrette said to the old 
woman, who, like her predecessor, was, at the same time, portress 
and swept the stairs : ‘'Mother So-and-So, if anybody should come 
and ask for a Pole or an Italian or, perhaps, a Spaniard, that is for 
me.’’ 

Now, this family was the family of our sprightly little bare-footed 
urchin. When he came there, he found distress and, what is sadder 
still, no smile ; a cold hearthstone and cold hearts. When he came in, 
they would ask : “Where have you come from ?” He would answer : 
“From the street.” When he was going away they would ask him : 
“Where are you going to ?” He wotild answer : “Into the street.” His 
mother would say to him: “What have you come here for?” 

The child lived, in this absence of affection, like those pale plants 
that spring up in cellars. He felt no suffering from this mode of exis- 
tence, and bore no ill-will to anybody. He did not know how a father 
and mother ought to be. 

But yet his mother loved his sisters. 

We had forgotten to say that on the Boulevard du Temple this 
boy went by the name of little Gavroche. Why was his name Gav- 
roche ? Probal)]y because his father’s name was Jondrette. 

To break all links seems to be the instinct of some wretched 
families. 

The room occupied by the Jondrettes in the Gorbeau tenement 
was the last at the end of the hall. The adjoining cell was tenanted 
by a very poor young man who was called Monsieur Marius. 

I.ct us see who and what Monsieur Marius was.

NINETY YEARS 0U&gt; AND TlIlRTV-TWt) TEETH 

In the Rue Boucherat. Rue de Nonuuntlie, aud Rue dc Saintonge, 
there vStill remain a few old inhahilanls wlu» ]&gt;resi‘rve a nieinnry of a 
fine old man named M. Gillenorniatuh Jmd wlu j Iik&lt;* tn talk alKuit him. 
This man was old when they were young* tigun\ to those who 
look sadly upon that vague swarm of shadiuvs wdiicli they call the 
past, has not yet entirely disappeared fnau the lahyrintli of sh*eets 
•in the neighlxnirhood of the Temple, to whidi, under f .ouis XIV., 
were given the names of all the ])rovi!H'es of h'ranets prtHTsely as in 
our days the names of all the capitals of iuin^pe have lu^eti given to 
the streets in the new Quartier Tivoli ; an advance, la* it sai(l hy the 
way, in wliich progress is visible. 

M, Gillenormand, who was as mtich alive as any man can he, in 
1831, was one of those men who luive hetantie curiosities. sim[)ly be- 
cause they have lived a long time ; atid who art* strange, Iteeause for- 
merly they were like everybody else, and now they are no longer like 
anybody else* He was a peculiar old man, aial very tntly a man of 
another age— the gerutine hotirgetns of the t*ightt,H*nili century, a very 
perfect si)ecinien, a little hatiglUy, wearing his got»l tdtl liourgeoisie 
as nmrciuises wear their mar&lt;iuisates. He Itad jnissed liis ninetieth 
year, walked erect, spoke in a lotul voicts saw clearly, drank hard, 
ate, slept, and snored. He hatl evt*ry one td his thirty-two teeth. He 
wore glasses only when reading. He. was of ati amorotts humour, 
but said that for ten yer*rs jtas* he had d&lt;H*idi*dIy and entirely re- 
nounced woimm. He was no longer [dcasing, he sai^l; he did not 
add : am too oldT Init, am tnt&gt; poor.'* 1 fir would say : ** 1 f I were 
not ruined, he! he!*' His natiaining incemie in fact was otdy about 
fiftceti thousand livres* His dream was id ri‘cciving a windfall, and 
having an income of a hnndri‘d thousaml francs, in ortler to keep 
mistresses. He did not ludong, as we see, to that sickly variety of 
octogenarians who, like M. (le Voltaire, are dying all tluar life; it 
was not a milk and water longevity ; this jovial old man was always 
in good health. He was superficial, hasty, easily angered. He got into 
a rage on all occasions, most frequently when most unseasonable* 
When anylKKly contradicted him he raised Ins cane ; he beat his serv- 
ants as in the time of Louis XIV* He had an unmarried daughter

over fifty years old, whom he belaboured severely when he was 
angry, and whom he would gladly have horsewhipped. She seemed to 
him about eight years old. He cuffed his domestics vigorously and 
would say,: Ah ! slut ! One of his oaths was : By the big slippers of big 
slipperdom! In some respects he was of a singular tranquillity: he 
was shaved every day by a barber who had been crazy and who hated 
him, being jealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a 
pretty coquettish woman. M. Gillenormand admired his own dis- 
cernment in everything, and pronounced himself very sagacious; 
this is one of his sayings : “I have indeed some penetration ; I can tell 
when a flea bites me, from what woman it comes.” The terms which 
he oftenest used were : sensible men, and nature. He did not give to 
this last word the broad acceptation which our epoch has assigned to 
it. But he twisted it into his own use in his little chimney-corner 
satires : “Nature,” he would say, “in order that civilisation may have 
a little of everything, gives it even some specimens of amusing bar- 
barism. Europe has samples of Asia and Africa, in miniature. The 
cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. The 
danseuses of the opera are rosy savagesses. They do not eat men, 
they feed upon them. Or rather, the little magicians change them into 
oysters, and swallow them. The Caribs leave nothing but the bones, 
they leave nothing but the shells. Such are our customs. We do not 
devour, we gnaw ; we do not exterminate, we clutch.”

LIKE MASTER, LIKE DWELLING 

He lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles de Calvaire, No. 6. The house 
was his own. This house has been tom down, and rebuilt since, ahd 
its number has probably been changed in the revolutions of number- 
ing to which the streets of Paris are subject. He occupied an ancient 
and ample apartment on the first story, between the street and the 
gardens, covered to the ceiling with fine Gobelin and Beauvais tap- 
estry representing pastoral scenes; the subjects of the ceiling and 
the panels were repeated in miniature upon the arm-chairs. He sur- 
rounded his bed with a large screen with nine leaves varnished Tfrith 
Coromandel lac. Long, full curtains hung fit the windows, and made 
great, magnificent broken folds. The garden, which waS immediately 
beneath his windows, was connected with the angle between them 
by means of a staircase of twelve or fifteen steps, which the old man 
iscended and descended very blithely.^ In addition to a library ad- 
foining his room, he had a boudoir which he thought very much of, 
1 gay retreat, hung with magnificent straw-colour tapestry, covered

Gillenormand’s dress was not in tlie fashion of l.emis \ \h, nor even 
in the fashion of l.onis X\ i. : he wore the costume of tlie im-myahlcs 
of the Directory. He had thou-;ht himself i|nite yotmu nntil then,

a little daiisense, ti uii'I named .Xaheiiry, who was &gt;.i vU'eii years old, 
like, him ohsenre as a eat, and with whom he fell in love. He wits full 
of reminiscences. He woulti exclaim: “How pretty Hu* w;is, that 
Guimard Gtiimardin t iiiimardiiietie, the last time 1 s.avv her at Long- 
champ.s, frix/.led in lofty sentiments, with her enrions trinkets in

nals, the newsi^itpen, the (ittselh's, as he said, stifling with hursts of 
laugiiter. “Oh !” said he, “wlwt are these jK'opIc !_( ‘orliiere ! i lumann ! 
Casimir Perier ! those are ministers for you. I imagine. see this in 
a journal; M. Gillenormand, Minister: that wottld Ik? a joke. Well! 
they are so stupid that it wonM go !’’ He called everything freely by 



MARIUS 509 

its name, proper or improper, and was never restrained by the 
presence of women. He would say coarse, obscene, and indecent 
things with an inexpressible tranquillity and coolness which was 
elegant. It was the_ off-hand way of his time. It is worthy of remark, 
that the age of periphrases in verse was the age of crudities in prose! 
His godfather had predicted that he would be a man of genius, and 
gave him these two significant names : Luke Esprit. 

IV 

AN INSPIRING CENTENARIAN 

He had taken several prizes in his youth at the college at Moulins, 
where he was born, and had been crowned by the hands of the Duke 
de Nivcrnais, whom he called the Duke de Nevers. Neither the Con- 
vention, nor the death of Louis XVL, nor Napoleon, nor the return 
of the Bourbons, had been able to efface the memory of this corona- 
tion. The Duke dc Nevers was to him the great figure of the century. 
“What a noble, great lord,” said he, “and what a fine air he had 
with his blue ribbon !” In Monsieur Gillenormand’s eyes, Catharine 
II. had atoned for the crime of the partition of Poland by buying 
the secret of the elixir of gold from Bestuchef, for three thousand 
roubles. Over this he grew animated. “The elixir of gold,” exclaimed 
he, “Besttichef’s yellow dye, General Lamotte’s drops, these were 
in the eighteenth century, at a louis for a half ounce flask, the great 
remedy for the catastrophes of love, the panacea against Venus. 
Louis XV. sent two hundred flasks to the Pope.” He would have 
been greatly exasperated and thrown off his balance if anybody had 
told him that the elixir of gold was nothing but the perchloride of 
iron. Monsieur Gillenormand worshipped the Bourbons and held 
1789 in horror ; he was constantly relating how he saved himself dur- 
ing the Reign of Terror, and how, if he had not had a good deal of 
gaiety and a good deal of wit, his head would have been cut off. If 
any young man ventured to eulogise the republic in his presence, he 
turned black in the face, and was angry enough to faint. Sometimes 
he would allude to his ninety years of age, and say, / really hope that 
I shall notsce ninety-three twice. At other times he intimated to his 
people that he intended to live a hundred years. 


V 

BASQUE AND NICOLETTE 

He had his theories. Here is one of them : ‘"When a man passionately 
loves woweti, and ha.s a wife of his own for whom h« cares but little.

arranges, deranges, economises, wastes; she does ioohsh dimgs, 
a magisterial and personal pleasure, and this consoles her While 
her husband disdains her, she has the satisfaction ol nnning her hus- 
band ” This theory. Monsieur (iillenorniaiid had applied to himself, 
and it had become his history. Mis wife, tlie see.md one, had ad- 
ministered his fortune in such wise that there reniamed to Monsieur 
Gillenorraand, when one fine day he found himself a wnlower, just 
enouMi to obtain, by turning almost eva*i \ thing into an annuity, an 
income of fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would 
expire with himself. lie had no hesitation, little troubled with the 
care of leaving an inheritance. .Moreover, he liad seen that patri- 
monie.s met with adventures, and, for exam|»le, hecame ihiliond 
propertv; he had been present at the avatars of the consolidated 
thirds, and he had little faith in the ledger. ’’/On.- (hiiiu-ampoix for 
all that!" said he. His house in Rue ties IMles tlit (.'alvaire, we have 
said, belonged to him. He had two tloinesties, “a male and a female.” 
When a domestic entered his service. Monsieur Ciilleuormand rc- 
baptised him. He gave to the men thy name of their pntvince : Nim- 
ois, Cointois, Poitevin, I’ieard. His last valet was a big, imrsy, 
wheezy man of fifty-live, incapable of nmiiiiig twenty steps, hut as 
he was born at Bayonne, Monsieur ( ulleiionnand calletl him Basque. 
As for female, servants, they were all calleil NieoU-tte in his house 
(even Magnon, who will reapjiear as we yrocectl ). t, tne &lt;Iay a pnnid 
cook, witha blue sash, of the lofh' race of porters, preseiiteil herself. 
“How much do you want a niunt'h ?” asked Monsieur t lilient.trmand. 
“Thirty francs." “What is your name ?" Olyinpie." Vou .shall have 
fifty francs, and your name shall be Nicolette." 


VI 

IN wnicit WI? SKE I.A MAGNON ANO ItEIl TWO WTTl.S ONES 

At Monsieur Gillenonnand's grief was Iranslated into anger : he was 
furiou,s at being in tlesjiajr. He had every prejudice, mnl took every 
ucence. One of the things of wliich he made up his external relief and 



MARIUS 511 

his internal satisfaction was, we have just indicated, that he was still 
a youthful gallant, and that he passed for such energetically. He 
called this having ‘'royal renown.'’ His royal renown sometimes at‘^- 
tracted singular presents. One day there was brought to his house 
in a basket, something like an oyster basket, a big boy, new-born, cry- 
ing like the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling clothes, which a 
servant girl turned away six months before attributed to him. 
Monsieur Gillenormaiid was at that time fully eighty-four years old. 
Indignation and clamour on the part of the bystanders. And who did 
this bold wench think would believe this ? What effrontery ! What an 
abominable calumny ! Monsieur Gillenormand, however, manifested 
no anger. He looked upon the bundle with the amiable smile of a man 
who is flattered by a calumny, and said aside : '‘Well, what ? what is* 
it ? what is the matter there ? what have we here ? you are in a pretty 
state of amazement, and indeed seem like any ignorant people. The 
Duke d’Angouleme, natural son of his majesty Charles IX., married 
at eighty-five a little hussy of fifteen; Monsieur Virginal, Marquis 
d’Alhuye, brother of Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, 
at eighty-three, had, by a chambermaid of the wife of President 
Jacquin, a son, a true love son, who was a Knight of Malta, and 
knighted Councilluf of State ; one of the great men 6f this century, 
Abbe Tabarand, was the son of a man eighty-seven years old. These 
things are anything but uncommon. And then the Bible ! Upon that, 
I declare that this little gentleman is not mine. But take care of him. 
It is not his fault.” This process was too easy. The creature, she 
whose name was Magnon, made him a second present the year after. 
It was a boy again. This time Monsieur Gillenormand capitulated. 
He sent the two brats back to the mother, engaging to pay eighty 
francs a month for their support, upon condition that the said mother 
should not begin again, tie added, ‘T wish the mother to treat them 
well. I will come to see them from time to time.” Which he did. 
had had a brother, a priest, who had been for thirty-three years 
rector of the Academy of Poitiers, and who died at seventy-nine. ‘7 
lost him young/" said he. This brother, of whom hardly a memory is 
left, was^ &lt;iuict miser, who, being a priest, felt obliged to give alms 
to the poor whom he met, but never gave them anything more than 
cop]:)ers or worn-out sous, finding thus the means of going to Hell by 
the road to Paradise. As to Monsieur Gillenormand, the elder, he 
made no trade of alms-giving, but gave willingly and nobly. He was 
benevolent, abrupt, charitable, and had he been rich, his inclination 
would have been to be magnificent. Pie wished that all that concerned 
him should be done in a large way, even rascalities. One day, having 
been swindled in an inheritance by a business man, in a gross and 
palpable manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation ; “Fie ! this is 
not decent ! I am really ashamed of these petty cheats. Everything is 
degenerate in this century, even the rascals. ’Sdeath! this is not the

TWO no KtiT MAKE A UAtK 

A.S to the two daughters of Munsitair GillenormatKl we have just 
spoken of them. They were horn ten years ajiart. In ilieir youth they 
resembled each other very little; and in character as well as in 
ctnintenance, were as far from being sisters as possible. 14ie younger 
was a cheerful .soul, attracted towards everything that is bright, busy 



MARIUS 515 

with flowers, poetry, and music, carried away into the glories o£ 
space, enthusiastic, ethereal, affianced from childhood in the ideal to 
a dim heroic figure. The elder had also her chimera ; in the azure 
depth she saw a contractor, some good, coarse commissary, very 
rich, a husband splendidly stupid, a million-made man, or even a 
prefect ; receptions at the prefecture, an usher of the ante-chamber, 
with the chain on his neck, official balls, harangues at the mayor’s, to 
be ''Madame la prefete,'’ this whirled in her imagination. The two 
sisters wandered thus, each in her own fancy, when they were young 
girls. Both had wings, one like an angel, the other like a goose. 

No ambition is fully realised, here below at least. No paradise be- 
comes terrestrial at the period in which we live. The younger had 
married the man of her dreams, but she was dead. The elder was not 
married. 

At the moment she makes her entry into the stoiy which we are 
relating, she was an old piece of virtue, an incombustible prude, one 
of the sharpest noses and one of the most obtuse minds which could 
be discovered. A characteristic incident. Outside of the immediate 
family nobody^ had ever known her first name. She was called 
Mademoiselle Gillcnormand the elder. 

In cant, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder could have given 
odds to an English miss. She was immodestly modest. She had one 
frightful reminiscence in her life : one day a man had seen her garter. 

Age had only increased this pitiless modesty. Her dress front was 
never thick enough, and never rose high enough. She multiplied 
hooks and pins where nobody thought of looking. The peculiarity of 
^ prudery is to multiply sentinels, in proportion as the fortress is less 
threatened. 

However, explain who can these ancient mysteries of innocence^ 
she allowed herself to be kissed without displeasure, by an officer off 
lancers who w’-as her grand-nephew and whose name was Theodule, 

Spite of this favoured lancer, the tith Prtide, under which we have 
classed her, fitted her absolutely. Mademoiselle Gillenormand was a 
kind of twilight soul. Prudery is half a virtue and half a vice. 

To prudery she added bigotry, a suitable lining. She was of the 
fraternity of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain feast-days, 
muttered special prayers, revered “the holy blood,” venerated “the 
sacred heart,” remained for hours in contemplation before an old- 
fashioned Jesuit altar in a chapel dosed to the vulgar faithful, and 
let her soul fly away among the little marble clouds and along the 
grand rays of gilded wood. 

She had a chapel friend, an old maid like herself, called Made- 
moiselle Vaiibois, who was perfectly stupid, and in comparison with 
whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the happiness of being an 
eagle. Beyond her Agnus Deis and her Ave Marias, Mademoiselle 
Vaubois had no light except upon the different modes of making

BOOK THIRD 

THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON 

I 

AN OLD SALON 

When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he frequented 
several very fine and very noble salons. Although a bourgeois, M. 
Gillenormand was welcome. As he was twice witty, first with his 
own wit, then with the wit which was attributed to him, he was even 
sought after and lionised. He went nowhere save on condition of 
ruling there. There are men who at any price desire influence and to 
attract the attention of others ; where they cannot be oracles, they 
make themselves laughing-stocks. Monsieur Gillenormand was not 
of this nature; his dominance in the royalist salons which he fre- 
quented cost him none of his self-respect. He was an oracle every- 
where. It was his fortune to have as an antagonist, Monsieur de 
Bonald, and even Monsieur Bengy-Puy-Vallee. 

About 1817, he always spent two afternoons a week at a house iiti 

his neighbourhood, in the Rue Ferou, that of the Baroness of T 

a worthy and venerable lady, whose husband had been, under Louij 
XVI., French Ambassador at Berlin. The Baron of T., who, during 
his life, had devoted himself passionately to ecstasies and magnetio 
visions, died in the emigration, ruined, leaving no fortune but ten 
manuscript volumes bound in red morocco with gilt edges, of very 
curious memoirs upon Mesmer and his trough. Madame de T. had 
not published the memoirs from motives of dignity, and supported 
herself on a small income, which had survived the flood nobody 
knows how. Madame de T. lived far from the court , — a very mixed 
society, said she, — in a noble, proud, and poor isolation. A feyr 
friends gathered about her widow’s hearth twice a week, and this 
constituted a pure royalist salon. They took tea, and uttered, as the 
wind set towards elegy or dithyrambic, groans or cries of horror over 
the century, ovef the charter, over the Buonapartists, over the pros- 
titution of the blue ribbon to bourgeois, over the Jacobinism of Louis 
XVIII. ; and they amused themselves in whispers with hopes which 
rested upon Monsieur, since Charles X. 

They hailed the vulgar songs in which Napoleon was called

Guemenee are at home there. A thief is admitted, provided he be a 
lord. 

The Count de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was a man of seventy-five, 
was remarkable for nothing save his silent and sententious air, hts 
cold, angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coat buttoned 
up to his cravat, and his long legs, always crossed in long, loose panta- 
loons, of the colour of burnt sienna. His face was of the colour of his 
pantaloons. 

This M. de Lamothe was ^'esteemed’’ in this salon, on account of 
his ‘‘celebrity,’' and, strange to say, but true, on account of the name 
of Valois. 

As to M. Gillenormand, his consideration was absolutely for him- 
self alone. He made authority. He had, spinghtly as he was, and with- 
out detriment to his gaiety, a certain fashion of being, which was im- 
posing, worthy, honoui-able, and genteelly lofty ; and his great age 
added to it. A man is not a century for nothing. Years place at last a 
venerable crown upon a head. 

He gave, moreover, some of those repartees which certainly have 
in them the genuine sparkle. Thus when the King of Prussia, after 
having restored Louis XVIII., came to make him a visit under the 
name of Count de Ruppin, he was received by the descendant of 
Louis XIV. somewhat like a Marquis of Brandenburg, and with the 
most delicate impertinence. Monsieur Gillenormand approved this. 
*'All khif/s zvho are not the King of France/^ said he, ^^are kings of a 
province^ The following question and answer were uttered one day 
in his presence : “What is the sentence of the editor of the Courier 
FrangaisF' “To be hung up for awhile." is superfluous," ob- 
served Monsieur Gillenormand, Sayings of this kind make position 
for a man. 

At an anniversary T e Deum for the return of the Bourbons, seeing 
Monsieur de Talleyrand pass, he said: There goes His Excellency 
the Bad, 

M. Gillenormand was usually accompanied by his daughter, this 
long mademoiselle, then past forty, and seeming fifty, and by a 
lieautiful little boy of seven, white, rosy, fresh-looking, with happy 
and trustful eyes, who never appeared in this salon without hearing 
a buzz about him : “How pretty he is ! What a pity ! poor child !" This 
child was the boy to whom we have but just alluded. They called 
him “poor child," because his father was “a brigand of the Loire." 

ThivS brigand of the Loire was M, Gillenormand’s son-in-law, al- 
ready mentioned, and whom M* Gillenormand called the disgrace of 
his family.

ONE OF TUB RK» Sl'ECTUBS OF THAT TIME 

Whoever, at that day, had passwl t!irini,i:h tho littlf ciiy of Wrnon, 
and -walked over that beautiful niouuiuenial bridge wliieh will he very 
soon replaced, let us hope, by some horrid wire hrid,;,w. would liave 
noticed, as his glance fell from the top of the parapet , a man of about 
fifty, with a leather casipie on his head.ylressed iu_ pantaloons and 
•waistcoat of coarse grey cloth, to which souiething yellow was 
stitched which had been a red ribbon, shod in wooden shoes, browned 
by the sun, his face almost black and his hair almost while, a large 
scar upon his foreheatl extending down his cheek, bent , bowed down, 
older than his years, walking neatly every tlay with ;i spaile and a 
pruning knife in his hattd, in one of those walleii conip.artnieiits, in 
the vicinity of the bridge, whieh, like a chain of terraces border the 
left bank of the .Seine, — eliarniing iiiclosnres full of llowers of which 
one would say, if they were innch larger, they are gart lens, an«i i f they 
were a little .smaller, they are bouejiiels. All tlie-a; inelnsnres are 
hotinded by the river on one sidt* and bv :i house on the other. 'I'he 
man in the waistcoat and woodett shoes ef whom we have just spoken 
lived, about the year 1H17, in the smallest of these inelo.iures and the 
humblest of these houses. I !e lived there solitary and alone, in .silence 
and in ])overty, with a woman who was neillieryiiimgnor old, iieiilier 
iteautiful nor ugly, neither peasant nor bourgeois, who wailed U|Km 
him. The .square of earth whieh lit; called his garden was celebrated 
in the town for the beauty cif the flowers which he euUivaterl in it. 
Flowers were his occupalioti. 

By dint of labour, perseverance, atteutimi. and jiails of water, 
he liad .succeeded in creating after the Creator, and had invented 
certain tulijis and dulilias whieh seemed to have been for,gotten by 
Isbature. He was ingenious: he anticipated Smlange Hodin in the 
Wmation of little dumps of heather eurtit for the culture of rare 
and precious shrubs from America and China. By Iireak of day, in 
summer, he was in Ins walks, tligging, pnmiiig, weeding, watering, 
walking in the midst of ftis flowers with an air td kindness, satlness, 
and gentleness, stHnetiines dreamy and tnotioiiless for whole hours, 
li.stening to the song of a bird hi a tree, the prattling of a ehiki in a 
house, or oftener with his eyes fixed on some lirop of dew» at the end 
of a spear of grass, of which the sun was making a earlamde. His 
table wa.s very frugal, and he drank more tnilk th.aii wine. An tirehin 
would make him yiekl, his servant scolded him. He was timid, so 
much so as to seem unsociable, he rarely went out, and s:(W imhiwlv 
put the poor who rajiimt at his wiinfnw, ami his enre, .Abbe Mahenf, 
a good old man. Still, if any of the inhahilantsof tliecityor strangers, 
whoever they might he, curious to see his tulips and roses, kmwked 



MARIUS 519 

at his little house, he opened his door with a smile. This was the 
brigand of the Loire. 

Whoever, at the same time, had read the military memoirs, the 
biographies, the Moniteur, and the bulletins of the Grand Aimy, 
would have been sti-uck by a name which appears rather often, the 
name of George Pontmercy. When quite young, this George Pont- 
mercy was a soldier in the regiment of Saintonge. The revolution 
broke out. The regiment of Saintonge was in the Army of the Rhine. 
For the old regiments of the monarchy kept their province names 
even after the fall of the monarchy, and were not brigaded uritil 
1794. Pontmercy fought at Spires, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turk- 
heim, at Alzey, at Mayence where he was one of the two hundred who 
formed Houchard’s rear-guard. He with eleven others held their 
ground against the Prince of Hesse’s corps behind the old rampart 
of Andernach, and only fell back upon the bulk of the army when the 
hostile cannon had effected a breach from the top of the parapet to 
the slope of the glacis. He was under Klebcr at Marchiennes, and at 
the battle of Mont Palissel, where he had his arm broken by a 
musket-ball. Then he passed to the Italian frontier, and he was one 
of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col di Tende with Joubert. 
Joubert was made Adjuant-General, and Pontmercy Second-Lieu- 
tenant. Pontmercy was by the side of Berthier in the midst of the 
storm of balls on that day of Lodi of which Bonaparte said : Berthier 
was cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier. He saw his old general, 
Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with uplifted sword, he 
was crying: Forward ! Being embarked with his company, through 
the necessities of the compaign, in a pinnace, which was on the way 
from Genoa to some little port on the coast, he fell into a wasp’s-nest 
of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese captain wanted to 
throw the guns into the sea, hide the soldiers in the hold, and slip 
through in the dark like a merchantman. Pontmercy had the colour* 
seized to the halyards of the ensign-staff, and passed proudly under 
the guns of the British frigates. Fifty miles further on, his boldne.ss 
Increasing, he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large Eng- 
ILsh transport carrying troops to Sicily, so loaded with men and 
horses that the vessel was full to the hatches. In 1805, he was in that 
division of Malher which captured Giinzburg from the Archduke 
Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received in his arms under a shower of 
balls Colonel Maupetit, who was mortally wounded at the head of 
the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that 
wonderful march in echelon under the enemy’s fire. When the 
cavalry of the Russian Imperial Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th 
of the Line, Pontmercy was one of those who revenged the repulse, 
and overthrew the Guard. The emperor gave him the cross. Pont- 
mercy successively saw Wurmser made prisoner in Mantua, Melas 
in Alexandria, and Mack in Ulm. He was in the eighth corps, of the 



520 L E S M I S K li A B h E S 

Grand Army, which Mortjer cominaiided, and wliicli took IlanAiu-ff, 
Then he passed into the 55th of the 1 diui, whieh was the old iMauders 
regiment. At Eylati, he was in tlui dnnadiyard where the heroic cap- 
tain Louis Hugo, uncle of the author of tins InH»k, sustained alone 
with his company of eighty-three nuai, fnr two hours, ilie whole 
effort of the enemy’s army. rontmc*rey was om^ td’ the three who 
came out of that churchyard alive, lie was at h'riedland. Tiien he 
saw Moscow, then the JJeresina, then lail/.en, Jlaut/.en, Dresrien 
Wachau, Leiiisic, and the defiles of (ilenhausen, then Xlontinirail^ 
Chateau-Tliierry, Caron, the hanks of the Marne, the hanks of the 
Aisne, and the formidable positimi at l.atm. At Arney le Due, a 
captain, he sabred ten tSKSsacks, ant! savt‘ti, not !iis gtmeral, but iiis 
corporal. He was wotmded oti that occasion, and twenty-seven 
splinters were extracted fnan his left arm aloiux Mivtht days before 
the capitulation of Laris, he exchanged witit a comrade, anil entered 
the cavahy. He ha&lt;I what was ca!h*d mtder the edi! rcedtui* ///c

fected hy military educatiini, whkli .ijives raise to Cia*tain special 
arms, the dragoons, for instance, who are both cavalry and infantry. 
He a(T{)m])anied Napoleon to llie island of Klha. At VValerbn^ he led 
a srptadron of cnirassiers in t hibois' brigadt*. He if wa.s who took the 
colnnrs from the Lunenburg battalion. 1 le carried the cobmrs to the "

1 thimkyoufirr mywhitw. An liour aftiaavards, he fell in the ravine 
of Ohain, Now who was this George Lontinercv ? He was tliat very 
brigand of the Loire. 

• We have already .seen stiniethifig of his history. After Waterloo,

neither Ins pu.silion of ollicer of the l4'gion cd I luuonr, niir his rank 
of colonel, nor his title of buron. Ht% on his part, neglected no ttppor- 
tumty to .sign himself Cohnel Ihmm Pontmvrey, He had only one 
old blue ct&gt;at, and he never went out wifitoiit pulling on i!k* rosette 
of an oflicer of the Legion of Honour* 1’he /»warcar tin mi notified 
nun that he wuitkl be prosecuted for “illegally** wearing this decora*^ 
Lon, Wdien this notice was given to him by a friendly intermediary, 
Fontmercy answered with a bitter smile: do not know whetherlt 
IS that I no longer uiuler.stan&lt;l h&gt;ench, or you no longer speak it ; but 



MARIUS 521 

the fact is I do not understand you.” Then he went out every day for 
a week with^his rosette. Nobody dared to disturb him. Two or 'three 
times the minister of war or the general commanding the department 
wrote to him with this address : Monsieur Commandant Pontmercy. 
He i-eturned the letters unopened. At the same time, Napoleon at St* 
Helena was treating Sir Hudson Lowe’s missives addressed to 
General Bonaparte in the same way. Pontmercy at last, excuse the 
word, came to have in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor. 

( So too, there were in Rome a few Carthaginian soldiers, taken 
prisoners, who refused to bow to Flaminius, and who had a little of. 
Hannibal’s soul. 

One morning, he met the procureur du roi in one of the streets of 
Vernon, went up to him and said : “Monsieur procureur du roi, ant 
I allowed to wear my scar ?” 

He had nothing but lijs very scanty half-pay as chief of squadron. 
He hired the smallest house he could find in Vernon. Pie lived there 
alone ; how we have just seen. Under the empire, between two wars, 
he had found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old 
bourgeois, who really felt outraged, consented with a sigh, saying: 
"The greatest families are forced to it.” In 1815, Madame Pont- 
mercy, an admirable woman in every re.spect, noble and rare, and 
worthy of her husband, died, leaving a child. This child would have 
been the colonel’s j oy in his solitude ; but the grandfather had imperi- 
ously demanded his grandson, declaring that, unless he were given 
up to him, he would disinherit him. The father yielded for the sake 
of the little boy, and not being able to have his child he set about lov- 
ing flowers. 

He had moreover given up everything, making no movement nor 
conspiring with others. Pie divided his thoughts between the innocent 
things he was doing, and the grand things he had done. He passed 
his time hoping for a pink or remembering Austerlitz. 

M. Gillenormand had no intercourse with his son-in-law. The 
colonel was to him "a bandit,” and he was to the colonel “a block- 
head.” M. Gillenormand never spoke of the colonel, unless some- 
times to make mocking allusions to “his barony.” It was expressly 
understood that Pontmercy should never endeavour to see his son 
or sp^ak to him, under pain of the boy being turned away, and dis- 
inherited. To the Gillenormands, Pontmercy was pestiferous.. They 
intended to bring up the child to their liking. The colonel did wrong 
perhaps to accept these conditions, but he submitted to them, think- 
ing that he was doing right, and sacrificing himself alone. 

The inheritance from the grandfather Gillenormand was a small 
affah, but the inheritance from Mile. Gillenormand the elder was 
considerable. This aunt, who had remained single, was very rich 
from the maternal side, and the son of her sister was her natural 
heir. The child, whose name was Marius, knew that he had a father, 



522 L E S M I S E R A B L K S 

but nothing more. Nobody spoke a word to him about him. However 
in the society into which his grandfather took him, the whisperings' 
the hints, the winks, enlightene&lt;I the little boy’s mind at length ; he 
finally comprehended something of it, and as lie naturally imbibed 
by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration, tiu: ideas and opinions' 
which formed, so to .say, the air he breathed, he came little by little 
to think of his father only with shame and with a closed heart. 

While he was thus growing up, every two or three months the col- 
onel would escape, come furtively to I ’aris like a fiigil ive f rom justice 
breaking his ban, and go to Saint Sulpice, at tlu; hour when Aunt 
(jillenormand took Marius to mass, 'riiere, trembling lest the aunt 
should turn round, concealed behind a pillar, nintioniess, not daring 
to breathe, he saw his child. 'I'hc scarrwl veteran was afraid of the 
old maid. 

From this, in fact, came his connection with the cure of Vernon 
Abbe Mabeiif. 

This worthy priest was the brother of a wanlen of Saint Sulpice, 
who had several times noticed this man ga/ing upon his child, and 
the .scar on his cheek, and the hig tears in his eyes. Tliis man, who had 
so really the appearance of :i man, ami wiio weiii like a woman, had 
attracted the warden’s attention, 'i'liis face remaineti in Ids memory. 
One clay, having gone to Verimn to .see his hrother. he met Colonel 
Pontmercy on the bridge, and rec(»gnised the man of Saint Sulpice. 
The warden spoke of it to the cure, and the two, mider some pre- 
text, made the colonel a visit. This visit led to others. 'I’hc colonel, 
who at first was very reserved, finally tmhosomed himself, and the’ 
cure and the warden came to know the whole storv. and how Pont- 
mercy was sacrificing his own happini'ss to the ftiture of liis child. 
The result was that the cure felt a veneral ion .and tenderness for himi 
and the colonel, on his part, felt an ailV'ction for llte ettre. And, more- 
over, when it hapjaens that both .are sincere ;md good, nothing will 
mix and amalgamate more easily than an i *Id priest .and an old soldier. 
In reality, they are the .same kind of m.an. f Jm; has deviated himself 
to his country upon earth, the otljer to Ins country in heaven ; there 
IS no other .difference. 

Twice a year, on the fir.st of January ami on St. fleorge's Day, 
Manus wrote filial letters to his father, which his aunt dictatetl-, and 
would have .said, were eojiied from somt* Conudete I.et- 
ter Writer ;this was all that M. (hllcnornuand allowial ; am! the father 
answered with very tender letters, which the grandfather thrust into 
ms pocket without reading.

REQUIESCANT 

The salon of Madame de T. was all that Marius Pontmercy knew 
of the world. It was the only opening by which he could look out into 
life. This opening was sombre, and through this porthole there came 
more cold than warmth, more night than day. The child, who was 
nothing but joy and light on entering this strange world, in a little 
while became sad, and, what is still more unusual at his age, grave. 
Surrounded^ by all these imposing and singular persons, he looked 
about him with a serious astonishment. Everything united to increase 
his amazement. There were in Madame de T.’s salon some very 
venerable noble old ladies, whose names were Mathan, Noah, Levis 
which was pronounced Levi, Cambis which was pronounced Cam- 
byse. These antique faces ^ind these biblical names mingled in the 
child's mind with his Old Testament, which he was learning by heart, 
and when they were all present, seated in a circle about a dying fire, 
dimly lighted by a green-shaded lamp, with their stern profiles, their 
grey or white hair, their long dresses of another age, in which 
mournful colours only could be distinguished, at rare intervals drop- 
ping a few words which were at once majestic and austere, the little 
Marius looked upon them with startled eyes, thinking that he saw, 
not women, but patriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms. 

Among these phantoms were scattered several priests, who fre-^ 
quented this old salon, and a few gentlemen; the Marquis de 

Sass , secretary of commands to Madame de Berry, the Viscount 

de Val , who published some monorhymed odes under the pseu- 
donym of Cha74es Antoine, the Pidnce de Beauff , who, quite 

young, was turning grey, and had a pretty and witty wife whose dress 
of scarlet velvet with gold trimmings, worn very low in the neck, 

startled this darkness, the Marquis de C d’E— the man in all 

France who best understood ^'proportioned politeness,^' the Count 

d'Am the goodman with the benevolent chin, and the Chevalier 

de Port de Guy, a frequenter of the library of the Louvre, called the 
king's cabinet. M, de Port de Guy, bald and rather old than aged, 
related that in 1793, when sixteen years of age, he was sent to the 
galleys as "refractory,", and chained with an octogenarian, the 
Bishop of Mirepoix, refractory also, but as a priest, while he was 
so as a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go to the 
scaffold at night, and gather up the heads and bodies of those that 
had been guillotined during the day; they carried these dripping 
trunks upon their backs, and their red galley caps were encrusted 
behind with blood, dry in the morning, wet at night These tragic 
anecdotes abounded in Madame de T7s salon ; and by dint of cursing 
Marat, they came to applaud Trestaillon. A few deputies of the un-

M. Lemarchant de Goinicourt, and^ liie celebrated jester of the

men, added to the importance at the T. salon, the kirilly aspect of 



MARIUS 525 

■which was emphasised by fi-^e peers of France, the Marquis de 
Vih the Marquis de Tal , the Marquis d’Herb r-, the Vis- 
count Damo , and the Duke de Val . This Duke de Val , 

although Prince de Mon , that is to say, a foreign sovereign 

prince, had so high an idea of France and the peerage that he saw 
everything through their medium. He it was who said : The cardinals 
are the French peers of Rome; the Lords are the French peers of 
England. Finally, since, in this century, the revolution must make 
itself felt eveiywhere, this feudal salon was, as we have said, ruled 
by a bourgeois. Monsieur Gillenormand reigned there. 

There was the essence and the quintessence of Parisian Legiti- 
matist society. People of renown, even though royalists, were held 
in quarantine. There is always anarchy in i-enown. Chateaubriand, 
had he entered there, would have had the same effect as Pere 
Duchenc. Some repentant backsliders, however, penetrated, by suf- 
ferance, into this orthodox world. Count Beug was received 

there by favour. 

The “noble” salons of the present day bear no resemblance to 
those salons. The Faubourg Saint Germain of the present smells of 
heresy. The royalists of this age are demagogues, we must say it to 
their praise. 

At Madame de T.’s, the society being superior, there was ex- 
quisite and haughty taste under a full bloom of politeness. Their 
manners comported with all sorts of involuntary refinements which 
were the ancient regime itself, buried, but living. Some of these 
peculiarities, in language especially, seemed grotesque. Superficial 
observers would have taken for provincial what was only ancient. 
They called a woman niadame la gcnerale. Madame la colonelle was 
not entirely out of use. The charming Madame de Leon, in memory 
doubtless of the Duchesse.s de I-ongueville and de Chevreuse, prefer- 
red this appellation to her title of Prince.ss. The Marchioness of 
Crequy also called herself jwtfrfawff to co/onr//*?. 

It wa.s this little lofty world which invented at the Tuileries the 
refinement of always saying, when speaking to the king in person, 
the king, in the third person, and never, your majesty, the title your 
maje.vty having been "sullied by the usurper.” 

Facts and men were judged there. They ridiculed the century, 
which dispensed with comprehending it. They assisted one another 
in astoni.shment. Each communicated to the rest the quantity of light 
he had. Methuselah instructed Epimenides. The deaf kept the blind 
informed. They declared, that the time , since Coblentz had not 
elapsed. Just as Louis XVIII. was, by the grace of God. in the twen- 
ty-fifth year of his reign, the emigrees were, in reality, in the twenty- 
fifth year of their youth. 

All was harmonious ; nothing was too inuoh alive ; speech was 
hardly a breath ; the journal, suiting ,the sakm, seemed a papyrus.

There were young people there, but they wert* sligluly dead. In the 
ante-chamber, the liveries were rild. These |H*rst mages, completely 
out of date, w&lt;‘re served by tiomesties ni tht^ saiue kiini. Altogether 
they had thenp|)earance of having lived a long time ago, and of being 
obstinate with the sepulchre. (.‘&lt;Hiserve, t onM'rvatisuj, i Tnservative,

There was in fact something aromatic in tin* npinions of tliese vener- 
able grotips, and their hicas smelt id Indiaii lierhs. It was a iruimmy 
world. The masters were crnhalmed, the vah*ts Wia’i* sIuimhI.

said, insulted each other ; the sword of Fontenoy was ridiculous, and 
nothing but rust ; the sword of Marengo was 'hateful, and nothing 
but a sabre. Formerly disowned Yesterday. The sense of the grand 
was lost, as well as the sense of the ridiculous. There was somebody 
who called Bonappte Scapin. That word is no more. Nothing, we 
repeat, now remains of it. When we happen to draw some form 
from it, and endeavour to make it live again in our thought, it seems 
as strange to us as an antediluvian world. It also, in fact, has been 
swallowed up by a deluge. It has disappeared under two revolutions. 
What floods are ideas ! How quickly they cover all that they are com- 
missioned to destroy and to bury, and how rapidly they create fright- 
ful abysses ! 

Such was the character of the salons in those far-off and simple 
ages when M. Martainville was wittier than Voltaire. 

These salon.s had a literature and politics of their own. They be- 
lieved in Fievee. M. Agier gave laws to them. They criticised M. 
Colnet, the publicist of the bookstall of the Quai Malaquais. Napo- 
leon was nothing but the Corsican Ogre. At a later day, the introduc- 
tion into history of M. the Marquis de Buonaparte, Lieutenant- 
General of the armies of the king, was a concession to the spirit of 
the century. 

These salons did not long maintain their purity. As early as 1818, 
doctrinaires began to' bud out in them, a troublesome species. Their 
style was to be royalists, and to apologise for it. Just where the ultras 
were proudest, the doctrinaires were a little ashamed. They were 
witty ; they were silent ; their political dogmas were suitably starched 
with pride ; they ought to have been successful. They indulged in 
what was moreover convenient, an excess of white cravat and close- 
buttoned coat. The fault, or the misfortune of the doctrinaire-party 
was the creation of an old yohth. They assumed the postures of sages. 
Their dream was to engraft upon an absolute and excessive prin- 
ciple a limited power. They opposed, and sometimes with a rare in- 
telligence, destructive liberalism by conservative liberalism. We 
heard them say : '‘Be considerate towards royalism ; it has done much 
real service. It has brought us back tradition, worship, religion, re- 
spect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It comes to as- 
sociate, although with regret, to the new grandeur of the nation the 
old grandeur of the monarchy. It is wrong jn not comprehending 
the revolution, the empire, glory, liberty, new ideas, new genera- 
tions, the century. But this wrong which it does us, have we not 
sometimes done it the same ? The- revolution, whose heirs we are, 
ought to comprehend all. To attack royalism is a misconception of 
liberalism. What a blunder, and what blindness? Revolutionary 
France is wanting in respect for historic France, that is to say for 
her mother, tluit is to say for herself. After the 5th of September, 
the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire

this chambermaid Nicolette who had succeeded Magnon, and this 
short-winded and pursy Basque whom, we have already mentioned. 

In 1827, Marius had just attained his eighteenth year. On coming 
in one evening, he saw his grandfather with a letter in his hand. 

‘'Marius,'' said M. Gillenormand, “you will set out tomorrow for 
Vernon." 

“What for ?" said Marius. 

“To see your father," 

Marius shuddered. He had thought of everything but this, that 
a day might come, when he would have to see his father. Nothing 
could have been more unlooked for, more surprising, and, we must 
say, more disagreeable. It was aversion compelled to intimacy. It 
was not chagrin ; no, it was pure drudgery. 

Marius, besides his feelings of political antipathy, was convinced 
that his father, the sabrer, as M, Gillenormand called him in the 
gentler moments, did not love him; that was clear, since he had 
abandoned him and left him to others. Feeling that he was not loved 
at all, he had no love. Nothing more natural, said he to himself. 

He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand, 
The grandfather continued : 

“It appears that he is sick. He asks for you." 

And after a moment of silence he added : 

“Start to-morrow morning. I think there is at the Cour des Fon- 
taines a conveyance which stai'ts at six o'clock and arrives at night. 
Take it. He says the case is urgent." 

Then he crumpled up the letter and put it in his pocket. Marius 
could have started that evening and been with his father the next 
morning. A diligence then made the trip to Rouen froin the Rue du 
Bouloi by night passing through Vernon. Neither M. Gillenormand 
nor Marius thought of inquiring. 

The next day at dusk, Marius arrived at Vernon. Candles were 
just beginning to be lighted. He asked the first person he met* for 
the house of M onsmir Pontmercy. For in his feelings he agreed with 
the Restoration, and he, too, recognised his father neither as baron 
nor as colonel. 

The house was pointed out to him. Fle rang ; a woman came and 
opened the door with a small lamp in her hand. 

“Monsieur Pontmercy?" said Marius. 

The woman remained motionless. 

“Is it here ?" asked Marius. 

The woman gave an affirmative nod of the head. 

“Can I speak with him?" 

The woman gave a negative sign." 

“But I am his son !" resumed Marius. “He expects me." 

“He expects you no longer," said the woman. 

Then he perceived that she was in tears.

field of Waterloo. Since the Restoration contests this title which I 
have bought with my blood, my son will take it and bear it. I need 
not say that he will be worthy of it.” On the back, the colonel had 
added : “At this same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. 
This man’s name is Thenardier. Not long ago, I believe he was keep- 
ing a little tavern in a village in the suburbs of Paris, at Chelles or at 
Montfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do Thenardier all the 
service he can.” 

Not from duty towards his father, but on account of that vague 
respect for death which is always so imperious in the heart of man, 
Marius took this paper and pressed it. 

No trace remained of the colonel. Monsieur Gillenormand had his 
sword and uniform sold to a second-hand dealer. The neighbours 
stripped the garden and carried ofli the rare flowers. The other plants 
became briery and scraggy, and died. 

Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the 
burial, he returned to Paris and went back to his law, thinking ho 
more of his father than if he had never lived. In two days the colonel 
had been buried, and in three days forgotten, 

Marius wore crape on his hat. That was all. 


V 

THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, TO BECOME REVOLUTIONARY 

Marius had preserved the i-eligious habits of his childhood. One 
Sunday he had gone to hear mass at Saint Sulpice, at this same 
chapel of the Virgin to which his aunt took him when he was a little 
boy, and being that day more absent-minded and dreamy than usual, 
he took his place behind a pillar and knelt down, without noticing it, 
before a Utrecht velvet chair, on the back of which this name was 
written : Momieur Maheuf, church-warden. The mass had hardly 
commenced when an old man presented himself and said to Marius : 

“Monsieur, this is my place.” 

Marius moved aviray readily, and the old man took his chair. 

After ma.ss, Marius remained absorbed in thought a few steps 
distant; the old man approached him again and said: “I beg youf 
pardon, monsieu'r, for naving disturbed you a little while ago, and 
' for disturbing you again now ; but you must have thought me iiri- 
pertinent, and i must explain myself .” 

“Monsieur,” said MariuS, “it is unnecessary.” '■ 

“Yes !” resumed the old min ; “I do not wish you to have a bad 
opinion of me. You see I think a great deal of that place. It seems to 
me that the mass is better there. Why? I will tell you. To that place 
I have seen for ten years, regularly, two or three months, a 



532 L E S M I S E R A B L K S 

poor, brave father come, who had n(^ otlicr opportunity and no other 
way of seeing his child, being prevented through some family ar- 
rangements. He came at the hour when he kiu‘w his son was brought 
to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was here. He 
did not even know, perhaps, that he liad a fatlier, the innocent boy! 
The father, for his part, kept behind a jiillar, so th*‘it noljody should 
see him. He looked at his child, and we])t. This poor man worship- 
ped this little boy. I saw that. This place lias hecomc sanctihed, as it 
were, for me, and I have acquired the liahit of coming Iiere to hear 
mass. I prefer it to the bench, where 1 have a riglit to l)e as a warden. 
I was even acquainted slightly with this unfortunate gentleman. He 
had a father-in-law, a rich aunt, relativt'S, 1 do not remember ex- 
actly, who threatened to disinherit the child if lu*, the father, should 
see him. lie had sacrificed himself that his sou might some day be 
inch and happy. They were separated hy political opinions. Certainly 
I approve of political opinions, but tlien; are j)eople who do not know . 
where to slop. Bless me ! because a man was at \\'aterloo he is not a 
monster; a father is not separated from his cltild for that. He was 
one of Bona];)artc’s colonels. He is dead, I lu^Iic've. He. lived at 
Vernon, where my brother is cure, and his name is soinelhing like 
Ponlmarie, Montpercy. He had a handstane sahre cut.*' 
'‘Pontniercy/’ said 'Marius, turning pale. 

“Exactly; Pontmcrcy. Did you know him?” 

“Monsieur./* said Afarius, “he was rny father.” 

The old churchwarden claspe(I his hands, and exclaimed-- 
“Ah! you are the child ! Yes, that is it ; lu* ought to he a man now. 
Well ! poor child, you can say that you had a fatlter wlio loved you 
well.*’ 

Marius offered his ann to the old man, and walked with him to his 

house. Next day he saitl to Monsieur (lillenormatid: - 

“We have arranged a hunting j»arfy witli a few frientls. Will you 
you permit me to he absent for tlir(*e days r” 

“hour,*’ answered the grandfather ; “gn ; amuse yoitrsclf,” 

And, with a wink he whispered to his tiauuluer-- 
“Some love affair!”

WHAT IT LS TO HAVE MET A rHUkCH WAtUlEN 

Where Marius went we shall st*e a litth* furtlier on. 

Marius was absent three days, ilien lie r(*(nrni*d to Parts, went 
straight to the lilirary of the law-sehool, and asked fm* the file of the 
Monitcur, 

He read the MonUcur; he read all the histories of the reptiblic 



MARIUS 533 

and the empire ; the Memorial de Sainte-HSlene; all the memoirs, 
journals, bulletins, proclamations ; he devoured everything. The first 
time he met his father’s name in the bulletins of the grand army he 
had a fever for a whole week. He went to see the generals under 
whom George Pontmercy had served — ^among others. Count H. The 
churchwarden, Mabeuf , whom he had gone to see again, gave him an 
account of the life at Vernon, the colonel’s retreat, his flowers and 
his solitude. Marius came to understand fully this rare, sublime, and 
gentle man, this sort of lion-lamb who was his father. 

In the meantime, engrossed in this study, which took up all his 
time, as well as all his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands 
more. At the hours of meals he appeared ; then when they looked 
for him, he was gone. The aunt grumbled. The grandfather smiled. 
“Poh, poh ! it is the age for the lasses !” Sometimes the old man 
added : “The devil ! I thought that it was some gallantry. It seems to 
be a passion.’’ 

It was a passion, indeed. Marius was on the way to adoration for 
his father. 

At the same time an extraordinary change look plate in his ideas. 
The phases of this change were numerous and gradual. As this is the 
history of many minds of our time, we deem it useful to follow these 
phases step by step, and to indicate them all. 

This history on which he liad now cast his eyes, startled him. 

The first effect was bewilderment. 

The republic, the empire, had been to him, till then, nothing but 
monstrous words. The republic, a guillotine in a twilight ; the em- 
pire, a sabre in the night. Pie had looked into them, and there, where 
he expected to find only a chaos of darkness, he had seen, with a sort 
of astounding surprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars shining, 
Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins, 
Danton, and a sun rising, Napoleon. Pie knew not where he was. He 
recoiled blinded by the splendours. Little by little, the astonishment 
passed away, he accustomed himself to this radiance ; he looked upon 
acts without dizziness, he examined personages without error ; the 
revolution and the empire set themselves in luminous perspective be- 
fore his sti-aining eyes ; he saw each of these two groups of events 
and men arrange themselves into two enormous facts : the republic 
into the sovereignty of the civic right restored to the masses, the em- 
pire into the sovereignty of the French idea imposed upon Europe; 
he saw spring out of the revolution the grand figure of the people, 
and out of the empire the grand figure of France. He declared- to 
himself that all that had been good. 

What his bewilderment neglected in this first far too synthetic 
appreciation, we do not think it necessary to indicate here. We are 
describing the state of a .mind upon the march. Progress is not ac-

complished at a bound. Saying this, once for all, for what precedes as 

well as for what is to follow, we continue. 

He perceived then that up to that time he had comprehended his 
country no more than he had his father. He had known neither one 
nor the other, and he had had a sort of voluntary night over his eyes. 
He now saw, and on the one hand he admired, on the other he wor- 
shipped. 

He was full of regret and remorse, and he thought with despair 
that all he had in his soul he could say now only to a tomb. Oh! if 
his father were living, if he had had him still, if God in his mercy 
and in his goodness had permitted that his father might he still alive, 
how he would have run, how he would have idiinged headkaig, how 
he would have cried to his father : “inither 1 I, am herc‘ ! it is I ! my 
heart is the same as yours 1 1 am your son T’ 1 low' he w'ould have em- 
braced his white head, wet his hair with tears, ga/.ed upon his scar, 
pressed his hands, worshipped his garments, kissed his feet ! oh ! why 
had this father died so soon, before tlie adolescence, l)efore the 
justice, before the love of his son 1 Alarius had a continual sob in his 
heart which said at every moment : ^‘/\las !” At tlie same time he be- 
came more truly serious, more truly grave, mvvr of his faitli and his 
thought. Gleams of the true came at every instant to complete his 
I’easoning. It was like an interior growlh. Me felt a sort of natural 
aggrandisement which these two new things, his fallier and his 
country, brought to him. 

As when one has a key, everything oixmecl ; he explained to him- 
self what he had hated, he penetrated what he had al)horrerl ; he saw 
clearly henceforth the providential, divine, and human meaning of 
the great things which he had been taught to detest, and the great 
men whom he had been iustrnclcd to curse. W'lxvn lu* thought of his 
former opinions, whicli were only of yesterday, but wliich seemed so 
ancient to him already, he became indignant at himsd f , and lie smiled. 
From the rehabilitation of his father he had naturally passed to the 
rehabilitation of Napoleon. 

This, however, we must say, was not acconi|&gt;lisluxl wit hout labour. 

From childhood he had been imbued with the judgment of the 
party of 1814 in regard to Bonaparte. Nt&gt;w, all tlie pr(‘judices of the 
Restoration, all its interests, all its instincts, tended to the disfigure- 
ment of Napoleon. It execrated him still more than it did Robes- 
pierre. It made skilful use of the fatigue of the nation and the hatred 
t)f mothers. Bonaparte had become a sort of monster almost falnilous, 
and to depict him to the imagination of the [leople, which, as we have 
already said, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 
1814 present in succession every terrifying mask, from that which 
is terrible, while yet it is grand, to that which is terrible in the gro- 
tesque, from Tiberius to Bugaboo, Thus, in speaking of Bonaparte, 
you might either weep, or burst with laughter, provided hatred was 



MARIUS 535 

the basis. Marius had never had — about that man, as he was called— 
any other ideas in his mind. They had grown together with the te- 
nacity of his nature. There was in him a complete little man who was 
devoted to hatred of Napoleon.. 

On reading his history, especially in studying it in documents and 
materials, the veil which covered Napoleon from Marius’ eyes 
gradually fell away. He perceived something immense, and suspected 
that he had been deceiving himself up to tliat moment about Bona- 
parte as well as about everything else ; each day he saw more clearly ; 
and he began to mount slowly, step by step, in the beginning almost 
with regret, afterwards with rapture,' and as if drawn by an irre- 
sistible fascination, at first the sombre stages, then the d iml y lighted 
stages, finally the luminous and splendid stages of enthusiasm. 

One night he was alone in his little room next the roof. His candle 
was lighted ; he was reading, leaning on his table by the open window. 
All manner of reveries came over him from the expanse of space and 
mingled with his thought. What a spectacle is night ! We hear dull 
sounds, not knowing whence they come; we see Jupiter, twelve 
hundred times larger than the earth, glistening like an ember, the 
welkin is black, the stars sparkle, it is terror-inspiring. 

He was reading the bulletins of the Grand Army, those heroic 
strophes written on the battle-field ; he saw there at intervals his 
father’s name, the emperor’s name everywhere; the whole of the 
grand empire appeared before him ; he felt as if a tide were swelling 
and rising within him ; it seemed to him at moments that his father 
was passing by him like a breath, and whispering in his ear ; gradu- 
ally he grew wandering ; he thought he heard the drums, the cannon, 
the trumpets, the measured tread of the battalions, the dull and dis- 
tant gallop of the cavalry ; from time to time he lifted his eyes to the 
sky and saw the colossal constellations shining in the limitless 
abysses, then they fell back upon the book, and saw there other colos- 
sal things moving about confusedly. His heart was full. He’ was 
transported, trembling, breathless ; suddenly, without himself know- 
ing what moved him, or what he was obeying, he arose, stretched his 
arms out of the window, gazed fixedly into the gloona, the silence, the 
da.rkling infinite, the eternal immensity and cried : Vive I’empereur ! 

From that moment it was all over; the Corsican Ogre— the 
usurper — ^the tyrant — the monster who was the lover of his sisters— 
the actor who took lessons from Talma— the poisoner of Jaffa— the 
tiger — Buonaparte — all this vanished, and gave place in Hs mind 
to a suffused and brilliant radiance in which shone out from an inac- 
cessible height the pale marble phantom of Csesar. The emperor had 
been to his father only the beloved captain, whom one admires, and 
for whom one devotes himself ; to Marius he was something more. 
He was the predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding

MARIUS 537 

By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer 
to his father, his memory, and the things for which the colonel had 
fought for twenty-five years, he drew off from his grandfather. As 
we liave mentioned, for a long time M. Gillenormand’s capricious- 
ness had been disagreeable to him. There was already between them 
all the distaste of a serious young man for a frivolous old man. 
Geront’s gaiety shocks and exasperates Werther’s melancholy. So 
long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been com- 
mon to them, Marius had met M. Gillenormand by means of them 
as if upon a bridge. When this bridge fell, the abyss appeared. And 
then, above all, Marius felt inexpressibly revolted when he thorwht 
that M. Gillenormand, from stupid motives, had pitilessly torn him 
from the colonel, thus depriving the father of the child, and the child 
of the father. 

Through affection and veneration for his father, Marius had al- 
most reached aversion for his grandfather. 

Nothing of this, however, as we have said, was betrayed externally. 
Only he was more and more frigid ; laconic at meals, and scarcely 
ever in the house. Wlien his aunt .scolded him for it, he was very mild, 
and gave as an excuse his studies, courts, examinations, disserta- 
tions, etc. 1 he. grandfather did not change his infallible diagnosis : 
“In love ? I understand it.” 

Marius was absent for a while from time to time. 

“Where can he go to ?” asked the aunt. 

On one of these journeys, which were always very short, he went 
to Montfermeil in obedience to the injunction which his father had 
left him, and sought for the former sergeant of Waterloo, the in- 
keeper I'henardier. Thenardier had failed, the inn was closed, and 
nobtxly knew what had became of him. While making these re- 
searches, Marius was away from the house four days. 

“Decidedly,” said the grandfather, “he is going astray.” 

They thought they noticed that he wore something, upon his 
breast and under his shirt, hung from his neck by a black ribbon. 


VII 

SOME PETTICOAT 

Wr have spoken of a lancer. 

^ He was a grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand's on the paternal 
side, who pas.qcd hi.s life away from his family, and far from all 
domestic hearths in^garrison, peutenant Theodule Gillenormand 
fulfilled all the conditions required for what is called a handsome 
officer. He had “the waist of a girl,” a way of trailing the victorious 
sabre, and a curling mustache. He came to Paris very rarely, s&lt;v 



538 L K S M I S K R A It L U S 

rarely that Marius had never seen him. 'I'he two coiisin.s knew each 
other only by name. I'heodule was, we think we have mentioned, the 
favourite of Aunt Gillenonntind, who preferred Iiim because she 
did not see him. Not seeing people permits us to imagine in them 
every perfection. 

One morning, Mile. Gillenormand the elder had retiretl to her 
room as much excited as her placidity allowed. Marius had asked his 
grandfather again for permission to make a sliort journey, adding 
that he intended to si;t out that evening, “t io !” the gnuulf.ather had 
answered, and M. Gillcnormand had added aside, lifting his eye- 
brows to the top of his forehead; “l ie is getting In be an old of- 
fender.” Mile. Ginenonnand had returned to her rooiu very much 
perplexed, dropping this exclamation iioiui on tlie stairs: “That is 
pretty !” and this interrogation p&lt;ijnl : “Hut where etm he be going?” 
She imagined some nuwe or less illicit aliair of the heart, a woman 
in the shadow, a rcndexvims, a mystery . and she_ would not have been 
. sorry to thrust her .spectacles into it. 'i'iie taste of a mystery resembles 
the first fre.shness of a slander: lioly stmls never despise that. There 
is in the secret compartments of higotr&gt;' some enriosily for .scandal. 

.She was therefore a ])rey to a hliiid desire for leaniing a .story. 

As a diversion from this curiosity which was giving her a little 
more agitation tlian she allowed herself, she look refuge in her 
talents, and began to festoon cotton tipon cotton, in one of those em- 
, broideries of the time of the empire and the restoration in which a 
great many cab wheels appear. Clumsy work, er.ahlted worker. She 
had been sitting in her chair for some hours when the door opened. 
Mile. Gillenormand ntised her eyes; Lieutenant 'rheoduU; was be- 
fore her making the regntalion liow. She niiensl a cry of plca-sure. 
You may be old, you may he a prtnle, yon may be.a Iti.vyii, you maybe 
his aunt, but it is always pleastmt to sih; a lancer enter your room. 

“You here, Theodule!" exclaimed she. 

“Qn my way, aunt.” 

“Embrace me then." 

“Ilere goe.s !" said Theodule. 

And he embraced her. Amu t iillentiriuand went to her secretary, 
' and opened it. 

“You .stay with tis at letist all the week ?" 

"Aunt, I leave this evening." 

"Impossible 1”. 

“Mathematically." ^ 

"Stay, my dear TIiwkIhU*, I lieg you." 

“The Iieart says yes, hut my onlers say no. Tlic story is simple. 
Our station is changed ; we were at Melun, we are sent to Gaillon. To 
go from the old station to tlie new, we must {&gt;ass through Paris. I 
said : I am going to go and sec niy aunt." 

“Take this for your pains," 



539 


MARIUS ■ 

She put ten louis into his hand. 

“You mean for my pleasure, dear aunt.” 

Theodule embraced her a second time, and she liad the happiness 
of having her neck a little chafed by the braid of his uniform. 

“Do you make the journey on horseback with your regiment?” 
she asked. 

“No, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have a special p^ermit. My servant 
takes my horse ; I go by the diligence. And, speaking of that, I have 
a question to ask you.” 

“What?”_ 

“My cousin, Marius Pontmercy, is travelling also, is he ?” 

“How do you know that ?” exclaimed the aunt, her curiosity sud- 
denly excited to the quick. 

“On my arrival, I went to the diligence to secure my place in the 
coupd.” 

“Well ?” 

“A traveller had already secured a place on the imperial I saw 
his name on the book.” 

“What name ?” 

“Marius Pontmercy.” 

“The wicked fellow !” exclaimed the aunt. “Ah ! your cousin is not 
a steady boy like you. To think that he is going to spend the night in 
a diligence.” 

“Like me.” 

“But for you, it is from duty ; for him, it is from dissipation.” 

“What is the odds ?” said Theodule. 

Here, an event occurred in the life of Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
the elder ; she had an idea. If she had been a man, she would have 
slapped her forehead. She apostrophised Theodule : 

“Are you sure that your cousin does not know you ?” 

“Yes. I have seen him ; but he has never deigned to notice me.” 

“And you are going to travel together so ?” 

“He on the imperiale, I in the coupe.” 

“Where does this diligence go ?” 

“To Les Andelys.” 

“Is there where Marius is going ?” 

“Unless, like me, he stops on the road. I get off at Vernon to take 
the bi'anch for Gaillon. I know nothing of Marius’s route.” ' ' 

“Marius ! what an ugly name ! What an idea it was to name him 
Marius ! But you at Ieast-r-your name is Theodule 1” 

“I would rather it were Alfred,” said the officer. 

“Listen, Theodule.” 

“I am listening, aunt.” 

“Pay attention.” 

“I am paying attention.” 

“Are you ready?” 



L E S M I S E K A li E E S 


540 

‘'Well, Marius is often away/' 

“Ell! eh!’' 

“He travels.” 

“Ah! ah!” 

“He sleeps away.” 

“Oh! oh!” ^ ^ 

“We want to know what is at the ])ottoni of it.” 

Thcodule answered with the calmness of a man of bronze: 

“Some petticoat.” 

And with that stifled chuckle which revt^ls ccrtJiinty, he added: 

“A lass.” 

“That is clear,” exclaimed the riiint, who thoiiidit slie lieard Mon- 
sieur Gilleiiormand speak, and win) felt lu‘r conviction spriin^^ irre- 
sistibly from this word lass, uttered almost in the same tone,l)y the 
grand-uncle and the grand-nephew. Slie resnnu'd : 

“Do us a kindness. Follow Marius a little way. He docs not know 
you, it will be easy for you. Since thert^ is a lass, try to see the lass. 
You can write us the account. It will amuse grandfather.” 

Thcodule had no excessive taste for tliis sort of watcliing ; but he 
was much affected by the ten louis, aud lie thought ht*. saw a j^ossible 
succession of them, lie accepted the commission ai\(l said: “As you 
please, aunt.” And he added aside: “I'here 1 am, a duenna.” 

Mademoiselle Gillenormand eml)race(l him. 

“You would not play such pranks, Idu'oclule. You are obedient 
to discipline, you are the slave of your orders, you are a scrupulous 
and dutiful man, and you would not leave your family to go to see 
such a creature.” 

The lancer put on the satisfied grimace of Carlouclic praised for 
his honesty. 

Marius, on the evening which followt‘d this dialogue, mounted 
the diligence without sus])ecting lliat he was watched. As to the 
watchman, the first thing that he did, was to fall ashH*p. 11 is slumber 
was sound and indicated a clear c&lt;.&gt;nscience, Argus snored all night. 

At daybreak, the driver of tlie ililigmua* slunited : “VTnmon ! Ver- 
non relay! passengers for Vernon?” And I.icutenant Thcodule 
awoke. 

“Good,” growled he, half asleej), “here I g(‘t off.” 

Then, his memory clearing up hy &lt;legre&lt;‘S, an effect of awakening, 
he remembered his aunt, the ten louis, anr! the account he was to 
render of Marius's acts and deed.s. it made him laugh. 

^ “Perhaps he has left the coach,” thouglit he, while he buttoned up 
his undress^ waistcoat “He may have slopped at INiissy ; he may have 
stopped at Triel ; if he did not get (AT at Meulaii. he nmy have got off 
at Mantes, unless he got olT at Rollehoise, or unless he only came to 
Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left towards Evreux, or to 



MARIUS 541 

the right towards Laroche Guyon. Run after him, aunt. What the 
devil shall I write to her, the good old woman ?” 

At this moment a pair of black pantaloons getting down from the 
imperiale, appeared before the window of the coupe. 

“Can that be Marius ?” said the lieutenant. 

It was Marius. 

A little peasant girl, beside the coach, among the horses and pos- 
tillions, was offering flowers to the passengers. “Flowers for your 
ladies,” cried she. 

Marius approached her and bought the roost beautiful flowers in 
her basket. 

“Now,” said Theodule leaping down from the coach, “there is 
something that interests me. Who the deuce is he going to carry those 
flowers to ? It ought to be a mighty pretty woman for so fine a bou- 
quet. I would like to see her.” 

And, no longer now by comrnand, but from personal curiosity, 
like those dogs who hunt on their own account, he began to follow 
Marius. 

Marius paid no attention to Theodule. Some elegant women got 
out of the diligence ; he did not look at them. He seemed to see noth- 
ing about him. 

“Is he in love ?” thought Theodule. 

Marius walked towards the church. 

“All right,” said Theodule to himself. “The church ! that is it. 
These rendezvoip which ate spiced with a bit of mass are the best 
of all. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes across the 
good God.” 

Arriving at the church, Marius did not go in, but went behind the 
building. He disappeared at the corner of one of the buttresses of 
the ’apsis. 

“The rendezvous is outside,” said Theodule. “Let us see the la^s.” 

And he advanced on tiptoe towards the corner which Marius had 
turned. 

On reaching it, he stopped, astounded. 

Marius, his face hid in his hands, was kneeling in the grass, upon 
a grave. He had scattered his bouquet. At the end of the grave, at an 
elevation which marked the head, there was a black wooden cross, 
with this name in white letters: Colonel Baron Pontmercy. He 
heard Marius sobbing. 

The lass was a tomb. . 

VIII 

marble AGAINST GRANITE 

It was here that Marius had come the first time that he absented 



542 LES MIS^RABLES 

himself from Paris. It was here that he returned every time that M. 

Gillenormand said : he sleeps out. 

Lieutenant Theodule was absolutely diconcertcd by tms unex- 
pected encounter with a sepulchre ; he exi)erienced a disagreeable and 
angular sensation which he was incapable of analysing, and which 
was made up of respect for a tomb mingled with re.spect for a colonel. 
He retreated leaving Marius alone in the churchyard, and there was 
something of discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with 
huge epaulets, and he gave him almost a military salute. N ot knowing 
what to write to his aunt, he decided to write nothing at all ; and prob- 
ably nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by The- 
odiile in regard to Marius’ amours, had not, by one of those myster- 
ious arrangements so frequently accidental, the scene at Vernon 
been almost immediately followed by a sort of counterrblow at 

^llarius returned from Vernon early in the morning of the third 
day was set down at his grandfather’s, and, fatigued by the two 
nights passed in the diligence, feeling the need of making up for his 
lack of sleep by an hour at the swimming school, ran quickly up to his 
room, took only time enough to lay off liis travelling coat and the 
black ribbon which he wore about his neck, and went away to the 
bath. 

M. Gillenormand, who had risen early like all old persons who are 
in good health, had heard him come in, ami hastened as fast as he 
could with his old legs, to climb to the toil o f the stairs where Marius’ 
rooija was, that he might embrace him, quest ion him while embracing 
him, and find out something about where he came from. 

But the youth had taken less time to go down than the octogenarian 
to go up, and when Grandfather Gillenormand entered the garret 
room, Marius was no longer there. 

The bed was not disturbed, and upon the bed wer? displayed with- 
out distrust the coat and the black riblion. 

“I like that better,” said M. Gillenormand. 

And a moment afterwards he entered tlie parlour where Made- 
moiselle Gillenormand the elder was already seated, embroidering 
her cab wheSls. 

The entrance was triumphal. 

M. Gillenormand held in one hand tlie coat and in the other the 
neck ribbon, and cried : 

“Victory ! We are going to penetrate the mystery ! we shall know 
the end of the end, we shall feel of the libertinism of our trickster!' 
here we are with the romance even. I have the portrait !” 

In fact, a black shagreen box, much like to a medallion, was fas- , 
tened to the ribbon. 

The old man took this ho-x and looked at it some time without 
opening it, with that air of desire, ravishment, and anger, with which 



MARIUS 543 

a poor, hungry devil sees an excellent dinner pass under, his nose, 
when it is not for him. 

‘Tor it is evidently a portrait. I know all about that. This is worn 
tenderly upon the heart. What fools they are! Some abominable 
quean, enough to make one shudder probably! Young folks have 
such bad taste in these days !” 

“Let us see, father,"’ said the old maid. 

The box opened by pressing a spring. They found nothing in it 
but a piece of paper carefully folded. 

“From the same to the same/'^ said M. Gillenormand, bursting 
with laughter. “I know what that is. A love-letter !” 

“Ah ! then let us read it !” said the aunt. 

And she’put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read 
this : 

“For my son . — The emperor made me a baron upon the battlefield 
of Waterloo. Since the restoration contests this title which I have 
bought with my blood, my son will take it and bear it. I need not say 
that he will be worthy of it.” 

The feelings of the father and daughter cannot be described. They 
felt chilled as by the breath of a death’s head. They did hot exchange 
a word. M. Gillenormand, however, said in a low voice, and as if 
talking to himself : 

“It is the handwriting of that sabren” 

The aunt examined the paper, turned it on all sides, then put it 
back in the box. 

Just at that moment, a little oblong package, wrapped in blue 
paper, fell from a pocket of the coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
picked it up and unfolded the blue paper. It was Marius" hundred 
cards. She passed one of them to M. Gillenormand, who read : Baron 
Marius Pontmercy. 

The old man rang. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took the rib- 
bon, the box, and the coat, threw them all on the floor in the middle 
of the parlour, and said : "" 

“Take away those things,” 

A full hour passed in complete silence. The old man and the old 
maid sat with their backs turned to one another, and were probably, 
each on their side, thinking over the same things. At the end of that 
hour, aunt Gillenormand said : 

“Pretty!” 

A few minutes afterwards, Marius made his appearance. He came 
in. Even before crossing the threshold of the parlour, he perceived 
his grandfather holding one of his cards in his hand, who, on seeing 
him, exclaimed with his crushing air of sneering, bourgeois super- 
iority: ■ ♦ ' 

“Stop ! stop ! stop! stop ! stop! you are a baron now* I present you 
my compliments. What does this mean ?” 



544 L E S M I S E K A B L E S 

Marius coloured slightly, and answered : 

“It means that I am my father’s son.’’ 

M. Gillenormand checked his laugh, and said harshly ; 

“Your father ; I am your father.” 

“My father,” resumed Marius with downcast eyes and .stern man- 
ner, “was a humble and heroic man, wlio scTvcd the republic and 
France gloriously, who was great in the greatest history that men 
have ever made, who lived a quarter of a century in the camp, by day 
under grape and under balls, by night in the snow, in the mud, and in 
the rain, who captured colours, who received twenty wounds, who 
died forgotten and abandoned, and who had but one fault ; that was 
in loving too dearly two ingrates, liis country and me.” 

This was more than M. Gillenormand could listen to. At the word 
Republic, he rose, or rather, .sprang to his feet. Fvery one of the 
words which Marius had pronounced, had ijroduced the elTcct upon 
the old royalist’s face, of a blast from a bellows ujiou a burning coal. 
From dark he had become red, from red inirple, and from purple 
glowing. 

“Marius!” exclaimed he, “abominable child! I don’t know what 
your father was ! I don’t want to know ! I know nothing about him 
and I don’t know him ! but what 1 do know is, that there was never 
anything but miserable wretches among ;tll tliat rabble! that they 
were all beggars, assassins, red cajis, thieves ! 1 say all ! I .say all ! I 
know nobody ! I say all ! do you he.ar, Marius ? Look you, indeed, you 
are as much a baron as my slipper ! they were all btmdits who served 
Robespierre ! all brigands who served li-u-o-naparte ! all traitors who 
betrayed, betrayed, betrayed ! their legitimate king ! all cowards who 
ran from the Prussians and ICngiish ;it W'aterloo ! 'I’hat is what I 
know. If your father is among them 1 don’t know him, I am sorry 
for it, so much the worse, your servant !” 

In his turn, Marius now iK^came the coal, and M. Gillenormand 
the bellows. Marius .shuddered in every liinli. h&lt;! knew not wdiat to 
do, his head burned. He was the priest who sees all his wafers thrown 
to the winds, the fakir who .sees a passer-Iiy spjit ujjon his idol. He 
could not allow such things to be said before him unanswered. But 
what could he do? His father had In-en trodden tiiuler foot and 
stamped upon in his presence, but I»y whom ? bv his grandfather. How 
should he avenge the one without outraging" the other? ft wa.s ini- 
possiible for him to insult his grandfather, and it was aiuully im- 
possible for hinuiot to avenge his father, ( )n one hand a sacred tomb, 
on the other white hairs. He was for a few moments dizzy and stag- 
pring with all this whirlwind in his head; then he raised his eyes, 
looked straight at Ins grandfather, and cried in a tlmndering voice: 

Down with the Bourbons, anti the great Img I.ouis XVI 1 1. !” 

Louis XVITI. had been dead for four years; but it was all the 
same to him. 



MARIUS 545 

The old man, scarlet as he was, suddenly became whiter than his 
hair. He turned towards a bust of the Duke de Berry which stood 
upon the mantel, and bowed to it profoundly with a sort of peculiar 
majesty. Then he walked twice, slowly and in silence, from the fire- 
place to the window and from the window to the fireplace, traversing 
. the whole length of the room and making the floor crack as if an 
image of stone were walking over it. The second time, he bent to- 
wards his daughter, who was enduring the shock with the stupor of 
an aged sheep, and said to her with a smile that was almost calm : 

“A baron like Monsieur and a bourgeois like me cannot remain un- 
der the same roof.” 

And all at once straightening up, pallid, trembling, terrible, his 
forehead swelling with the fearful radiance of anger, he stretched 
his arm towards Marius and cried to him ; 

“Be off.” 

Marius left the house. 

The next day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter : 

“You will send sixty pistoles every six months to this blood- 
drinker, and never speak of him to me again.” 

Having an immense residuum of fury to expend, and not knowing 
what to do with it, he spoke to his daughter with coldness for more 
than three months. 

Marius, for his part, departed in indignation. A circumstance, 
which we must mention, had aggravated his exasperation still more. 
There are always such little fatalities complicating domestic dramas. 
Feelings are embittered by them, although in reality the faults are 
none the greater. In hurriedly carrying away, at the old man’s com- 
mand, Marius’ “things” to his room, Nicolette had, without per- 
ceiving it, dropped, probably on the garret stairs, which were dark, 
the black shagreen medallion which contained the paper written by 
the colonel. Neither the paper nor the medallion could be found. 
Marius was convinced that “Monsieur Gillenormand”— from that 
day forth he never named him otherwise — ^had thrown “his father’s 
will” into the fire. He knew by heart the few lines written by the 
colonel, and consequently nothing was lost. But the paper, the writ- 
ing, that sacred relic, all that was his heart itself. What had been done 
with it? ' 

Marius went away without saying where he was going, and with- 
out knowing where he was going, with thirty francs, his watch, and 
a few clothes in a carpet bag. He hired a cabriolet by the hour, jumped 
in, and drove at random towards the Latin quarter. 

What was Marius to do?.

THE FRIENDS Ol-' THE ABC 
I 


A GROUP WHICH AI.MOST lll'.CAMU HISTORIC 

At that period, apparently indiiTcrent, .soiufthinji; of a revolutionary 
thrill was vaguely felt. Whispers coming from the depths of ’89 
and of ’92 were in the air. Young P.'iris was, excmsc the expression 
in the process of moulting. People were transformeil almost with- 
out suspecting it, by the very niovemenl of the t ime. 'I'he hand which 
moves over the dial moves also among souls. Each one took the step 
forward which was before him. Royalists became lilicrals, liberals 
became democrats. 

It was like a rising tide, complicated by a thinisaiul ebbs ; the pe- 
culiarity of the ebb is to make mixtures fthence very singular com- 
binations of ideas ; men worsliiiipjcd at the same time Napoleon and 
liberty. Wo are now writing history. 'J’hese were the mirages of that 
day. Opinions pass through phases. Vollaifian royalism, a grotes- 
que variety, had a fellow not les.s strange, Bonapaflisi liberalism. 

_ Other groups of minds were more serions. 'I'hev fatiiomed prin- 
ciple; they attached themselves to right. I'hey loriged for the ab- 
solute, they caught glimp.ses of the inlinite realisations ; the absolute 
by its very rigidity, pushes the mind townnls the iiuuiidless, and 
makes it float in the illimitable, 'j'here is nothing like ilream to create 
the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and hlood fti-niornnv. 

Advanced opinions had double foundations. 'I'he appearance of 
mystery threatened “the esahlisheel order of things,” which was sul- 
len and suspicious— a .sign in the highest degree revolntioiuiry. The 
reservations of power meet flu! reservations of the jieoplj. in the sap.

At that time there wen* nut yet in h' ranee any of tliose underlying

but here and there obscure excavations were branehingout. I 41 Cou-

afiihaUons of this kind, the Society of the I'riends of tlie A B C. 

^ ho were the briend.s of the A It C? A society having as its a'm, 
in appearance, the education of children ; in reality, the elevation if 
men.

They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C.^ The abaissS 
[the abased] were the people. They wished to raise them up. A pun 
at which you should not laugh. Puns are sometimes weighty in pol- 
itics, witness the C astral us ad castra, which made Narses a general 
of an army ; witness, Barhari ct Barbanni; witness, Fueros y Fue- 
gos; witness, Tu cs Petrus ct super hanc Petram, etc., etc. 

The Friends of the ABC were n&lt;3t numerous, it was a secret so- 
ciety in the embryonic state ; we should almost say a coterie, if co- 
teries produced heroes. They met in Paris, at two places, near the 
Halles, in a wine shop called Corinthe, which will be referred to 
hereafter, and near the Pantheon, in a little coffeehouse on the Place 
Saint Michel, called Le Cafe Musain, now torn down; the first of 
these two places of rendezvous was near the working-men, the 
second near the students. 

The ordinary conventicles of the Friends of the ABC were held 
in a back room of the Cafe Musain. 

This room, quite distant from the cafe, with which it commun- 
icated by a very long passage, had two windows, and an e.vit by a 
private stairway upon the little Rue des Gres. They smoked, drank, 
played, and laughed there. They talked very loud about everything, 
and in whispers about something else. On the wall was nailed, an 
indication sufficient to awaken the suspicion of a police officer, an 
old map of France tmder the republic. 

Most of the r''riend.s of the ABC were students, in thorough 
understanding with a few working-men.The names of the principal 
are as follows. They belong to a certain e.xtent to history ; Enjolras, 
Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle 
or Laigle, Joly, Grataire. 

These young men constituted a sorb of family among themselves, 
by force of friendship. All except I-aigle were from the South. 

This was a remarkable group. It has vanished into the invisible 
depths which are behind us. At the iKunt of this drama which we have 
now reached, it may not be tiselc‘s.s to throw a ray of light upon these 
young heads before the reader sees them .sink into tlie shadow of a 
tragic fate. 

EnJolra.s, whom we havg named first, the reasion why will be seen 
by-and-liy, was an only son and was rich. 

Enjolras was a charming young man, who wa.s capable of being 
terrible. He was angelically beautiful. He was Antinous wild. You 
would have .said, to see the thoughtful reflection of his eye, that he 
had already, In .some preceding exi.stence, passed through the revo- 
lutionary apocalypse. He had the tradition of it like an eye-witness. 
He knew all the little details of the grand thing, a pontifical and 
warrior nature, strange in a youth. He was officiating and militant ;

irom natural purity. He loved the word citizen, but he preferred the 
word man. He would have gladly said : H ombre, like the Spaniards. 
He read everything, went to the theatres, attended the public courts, 
learned the polarisation of light from Arago, was enraptured with 
a lecture in which Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire had explained the double 
function of the exterior carotid artery and the interior carotid artery, 
one of which supplies the face, the other the brain ; he kept pace with 
the times, followed science step by step, confronted Saint Simon with 
Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebbles which he found 
and talked about geology, drew a moth-butterfly from memory, 
pointed out the mistakes in French in the dictionary of the Academy, 
studied Puysegur and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles ; 
denied nothing, not even ghosts ; looked over the files of the Moni- 
teiir, reflected. He declared the future was in the hands of the school- 
master, and busied himself with questions of education. He desired 
that society should work without ceasing at the elevation of the in- 
tellectual and moral level ; at the coming of knowledge, at bringing 
'deas into circulation, at the growth of the mind in youth ; and he 
feared that the poverty of the methods then in vogue, the meanness 
of a literary world which was circumscribed by two or three cent- 
uries, called classical, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, 
scholastic prejudices and routine, would result in making artificial 
oyster-beds of our colleges. He was learned, purist, precise, univer- 
sal, a hard student, and at the same time given to musing, /‘even 
chimerical,” said his friends. Fie believed in all the dreams : railroads, 
the suppression of suffering in surgical operations, the fixing of the 
image in the camei*a obscura, the electric telegraph, the steering of 
balloons. Little dismayed, moreover, by the citadels built upon all 
sides against the human race by superstitions, despotisms, and prej- 
udices, he was one of those who think that science will at last turn 
the position. Enjolras was a chief ; Combeferre was a guide. You 
would have preferred to fight with the one and march with the other. 
Not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting; he did not refuse 
to close with an obstacle, and to attack it by main strength and by ex- 
plosion, but to put, gradually, by the teaching of axioms and the pro- 
mulgation of positive laws, the human race in harmony with its 
destinies, pleased him better; and of the two lights, his inclination 
was rather for illumination than for conflagration. A fire would 
cause a dawn, undoubtedly, but why not wait for the break of day? 
A volcano enlightens, but the morning enlightens still better. Combe- 
ferre, perhaps, preferred the pure radiance of the beautiful to the 
glory of the sublime. A light disturbed by smoke, an advance pur- 
chased by violence, but half satisfied this tender and serious mind. 
A headlong plunge of a people into the truth, a '93, startled him ; 
still stagnation repelled him yet more, in it he felt putrefaction and 
death ; on the whole, he liked foam better than miasma, and he pre- 



550 LES MISERABLES 

ferred the torrent to the cess-pool, and the Falls of Niagara to the 
Lake of Montfaucon. In short, he desired neither halt nor haste. 
While his tumultuous friends, chivalrously devoted to the absolute, 
adored and asked for splendid revolutionary adventures, Combe- 
ferre inclined to let progress do her work, — the good progress ; cold, 
perhaps, but pure ; methodical, but irreproachable ! phlegmatic, but 
imperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt down and clasped his 
hands, asking that the future might come in all its radiant purity and 
that nothing might disturb the unlimited virtuous development of 
the people. “The good must be innocent,” he repeated incessantly. 
And in fact, if it is the grandeur of the revolution to gaze steadily 
upon the dazzling ideal, and to fly to it through the lightnings, with 
blood and fire in its talons, it is the beauty of progress to be without 
a stain; and there is between Washington, who represents the one, 
and Danton, who incarnates the other, the difference which separates 
the angel with the wings of a swan, from the angel with the wings 
of an eagle. 

Jean Prouvaire was yet a shade more subdued than Combeferre. 
He called himself Jehan, from that little momentary fancifulness 
which mingled with the deep and powerful movement from which 
arose the study of the Middle Ages, then so necessaiy. Jean Prou- 
vaire was addicted to love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, played on 
the flute, made verses, loved the people, mourned over wonian, wept 
over childhood, confounded the future and God in the same faith, 
and blamed the revolution for having cut oft' a royal head, that of 
Andre Chenier. His voice was usually delicate, but at times suddenly 
became masculine. Pie was well read, even to erudition, and almost 
an orientalist. Above all, he was good, and, a very natural thing to 
one who knows how near goodness borders upon grandeur, in poetry 
he preferred the grand. He understemd Italian, Latin, Greek, and 
Hebrew; and that served him only to read four poets : Dante, Juve- 
nal, iEschylus, and Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to Ra- 
cine, and Agrippa d’Aubigne to Corneille. He was fond of strolling 
in fields of wild oats and blue-bells, and paid almost as much atten- 
tion to the clouds as to pa.ssing events. His mind had two attitudes — 
one towards man, the other towards God ; he studied, or he contem- 
plated. AH day he pondered over .social questions : wages, capital, 
credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought, liberty of love, educa- 
tion, punishment, misery, a.ssociation, property, production and dis- 
tribution, the lower enigma which covers the human ant-hill with a 
shadow ;_and at night he ^zed upon the stars, those enormous beings. 
Like Enjolras, he was rich, and an only son. He sjwke gently, bent 
his head, cast down his eyes, smiled with embarrassment, dressed 
6adly, had an awkward air, blushed at nothing, was very timid, still 
intr^id. 

Fcuilly was a fan-maker, an orphan, who. with diflficulty earned 


( 



MARIUS . 551 

three francs a day, and who had but one thought, to deliver the world 
He had still another desire— to instruct himself ; which he also called 
deliverance He had taught himself to read and write; all that he 
knew, he had learned alone* Feuilly was a generous heart. He had an 
immense embrace. This orphan had adopted the people. Being with- 
out a mother, he had meditated upon his mother country. He was not 
willing that there should be any man upon the earth without a coun- 
try. He nurtured within himself, with the deep divination of the 
man of the people, what we now call the idea of nationality. He had 
learned history expressly that he might base his indignation upon a 
knowledge of its cause. In this new upper room of utopists partic- 
ularly interested in France, he represented the foreign nations. His 
Greece, Poland, Hungary, the Danubian Provinces, 
and Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, in season and out of 
season, with the tenacity of the right. Turkey upon Greece and Thes- 
saly, Russia upon Warsaw, Austria upon Venice, these violations 
exasperated him. The grand highway robbery of 1772 excited him 
above all. There is no more soverign eloquence than the truth in in- 
dignation; he was eloquent with this eloquence. He was never done 
with that infamous date, 1772, that noble and valiant people blotted 
out by treachery, that threefold crime, .that monstrous ambuscade, 
prototype and pattern of all those terrible suppressions of states 
which, since, have stricken several noble nations, and have, so to say, 
erased the record of their birth. All the contemporary assaults upon 
society date from the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is 
a theorem of which all the present political crimes are corollaries. 
Not a despot, not a_ traitor, for a century past, who has not vised, 
confirmed, countersigned, and set his initials to, ne varietur ^ the par- 
tition of Poland. When you exaniine the list of modern tre^rsons, 
that appears first of all. The Congress of Vienna took advice of this 
crime before consummating its own. The halloo was sounded by 
1772, 1815 is the quarry. Such was the usual text of Feuilly. This 
poor working man had made Himself a teacher of justice, and she 
rewarded him by making him grand. For there is in fact eternity in 
the right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teu- 
tonic. The kings Ipse their labour at this, and their honour. Sooner or 
later, the submerged country floats to the surface and reappears. 
Greece again becomes Greece, Italy again becomes Italy. The protest 
of the right against the fact, persists forever. The robbery oi a 
people never becomes prescriptive. These lofty swindles have no 
future. You cannot pick the mark out of a nation as you can out of 
a handerkerchief .

parents were peasants, in whom he had succeeded in inculcating a 
respect for their son. 

He said of them: ''They are peasants and not bourgeois; which 
explains their intelligence.” 

Bahorel, a capricious man, was scattered over several cafes; the 
others had habits, he had none. He loafed. To err is human. To loaf 
is Parisian. At bottom, a penetrating mind and more of a thinker 
than he seemed. 

He served as a bond between the Friends of the ABC and some i 
other groups which were without definite shape, but which were to 
j take form afterwards. 

In this conclave of young heads there was one bald member. 

The Marquis d'Avaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke for 
having helped him into a cab the day that he emigrated, related that 
in 1814, on his return to France, as the king landed at Calais, a man 
presented a peiition to him. 

"What do you want ?” said the king. 

"Sire, a post-office.” 

"What is your name ?” 

"L'Aigle.” [The eagle]. 

The king scowled, looked at the signature of the petition and saw 
the name written thus: Lesgle. This orthography, anything but 
Bonapartist, pleased the king, and lie began to smile. "Sire,” resumed 
the man with the petition, "my ancestor was a dog-trainer surnamed 
Lesgueules [The Chaps]. This surname has become my name. My 
name is Lesgueules, by contraction Lesgle, and by corruption 
L'Aigle.” This made the king finish his smile. He afterwards gave 
the man the post-office at Meaux, either intentionally or inadver- 
tently. 

The bald member of the club was son of this Lesgle, or Legle, 
and signed his name Legle (de Meaux), Flis comrades, for the sake 
of brevity, called him Bossuet. 

Bossliet was a cheery fellow who was unlucky. His specialty was 
to succeed in nothing. On the other hand, he laughed at everything. 
At twenty-five he was bald. His father had died owning a house and 
some land ; but he, the son, had found nothing more urgent than to 
lose this house and land in a bad speculation. Fie had nothing left. 
He had considerable knowledge and wit, but he always miscarried. 
Everything failed him, everything deceived him ; whatever he built 
up fell upon him. If he split wood, he cut his finger. If he had a 
mistress, he very soon discovered that he had also a. friend.^ Every 
moment some misfortune happened to him; hence his j6viality. He 
said : I live under the roof of the falling tiles. Rarely astonished, 
since he was always expecting some accident, he took ill luck with 
serenity and smiled at the vexations of destiny like one who hears a 
jest. He was ooor. but his fund of good-humour was inexhaustible- 



554 LES MISERABLES 

He soon reached his last sou, never his last burst of laughter. When 
met by adversity, he saluted tliat acquaintance cordially, he patted 
catastrophes on the back ; he was so familiar with fatality as to call 
it by its nick-name. “Good morning, old Genius,” he would say. 

These persecutions of fortune had made him inventive, hie was 
full of resources. He had no money, but he found means, when it 
seemed good to him, to go to “reckless expenses.” One night, he 
even spent a hundred francs on a supper with a quean, which in- 
spired him in the midst of the orgy with this memorable saying: 
“Daughter of five Louis, pull off my bools.” 

Bossuet was slowly making his way towards the legal pro- 
fession ; he was doing his law, in the manner of Bahorel. Bossuet had 
never much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged sometimes 
with one, sometimes with another, oftene.st with joly. Joly was 
studying medicine. He was two years younger than Bousset. 

Joly was a young Malade Imaginaire. What he had learned in 
medicine was rather to be a patient than a physician. At twenty- 
three, he thought himself a valetudinarian, and passed his time in 
looking at his tongue in a mirror. He declared that man is a magnet, 
like the needle, and iiv his room he placed his bed with the head to 
the south and the foot to the north, .so that at night the circulation 
of the blood should not be interfered with by the grand magnetic 
current of the globe. In stormy weather, he felt his pulse. Nevetthe- 
less, the gayest of all. All these incoheremx's, young, notional, sickly. 
Joyous, got along very well together, and the result was an eccentric 
and agreeable person whom his comrades, i)rodigal of consonants, 
called Jolllly. “You can fly upon four L’s,” wings] said Jean 
Prouvaire. 

Joly had the habit of rubbing his nose with the end of his cane 
which is an indication of a .sagacious mind. 

All these young men. diverse as they were, and of whom, as a 
whole we ought only to speak seriously, ha&lt;l the same religion; 
Progress. 

All were legitimate sons of the French Revolution. The lightest 
became solemn when pronouncing thi,s date : ’89. Their fathers ac- 
cording to the flesh, were, or had been b'enillants, Royalists, Doc- 
trinaires ; it mattered little; this hurly-burly which antedated them, 
liad nothing to do with them ; they were young ; the pure blood of 
principles flowed in their veins. They attached themselves without 
an inteiTuediate shade to incorruptible right and to absolute duty. 

Affiliated and initiated, they secretly .sketched out tlieir ideas. 

Among all these j«issionate hearts and all these undoubting minds 
there was on sceptic. How did he happen t&lt;j be there? frotn juxta- 
piosition. The name of this sceptic was Grantaire, and he usually 
signed with the rebus : R [grand R, great R], Grantsiire was a man 
who took good care not to believe anything. He was, moreover, one 



MARIUS 5SS 

of the students who hs.d learned most during their course in Paris * 
he knew that the best coffee was at the Cafe Lemblin. and the best' 
billiard table at the Cafe Voltaire; that you could find good rolls 
and good girls at the hermitage on the Boulevard du Maine, broiled 
chickens at Mother Saguet’s, eccellent chowders at the Barriere 
de la Cunette, and a peculiar light white wine at the Barriere du 
Combat. He^ knew the good places for everything ; furthermore 
boxing, tennis, a few dances, and he was a profound cudgel-player 
A great drinker to boot. He was frightfully ugly ; the prettiest shoe- 
binder of that pienod, Irma Boissy, revolting at his ugliness had 
uttered this sentence: “Grantaire is impossible,” but Grantaire’s 
klf-conceit was not disconcerted. He looked tenderly and fixedly 
upon every woman, appearing to say of them all : i/ J only would- 
and trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general de- 
mand. 

All these words : rights of the people, rights of man, social con- 
tract, French Revolution, republic, democracy, humanity, civilisa- 
tion, religion, progress, were, to Grantaire, very nearly meaningless. 
He smiled at them. Scepticism, that cries of the intellect, had not 
left one entire idea in his mind. He lived in irony. This was his 
axiom : There is only one certainty, my full glass. He ridiculed all 
devotion, under all circumstances, in the brother as well as the 
father, in Robespierre the younger as well as LoizeroUes. “They 
were very forward to be dead,” he exclaimed. He said of the cross : 
“There is a gibbet which has made a success.” A rover, a gambler, 
a libertine, and often drunk, he displeased these young thinkers 
by singing incessantly : “/ loves the girls and I loves good wine.’' 
Air: Vive Henri IV. 

Still, this sceptic had a fanaticism. This fanaticism was neithei 
an idea, nor a dogma, nor an art, nor a science ; it was a man : En- 
jolras. Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom 
did this anarchical doubter ally himself in this phalanx of absolut« 
minds ? To the most absolute. In what way did Enjolras subjugate 
himP By ideas? No. By a character. A phenomenon often seen. A 
sceptic adhering to a believer; that is as simple as the law of the 
complementary colours-. What we lack attracts us. Nobody loves the 
light like the blind man, The dwarf adores the drum-major. The 
toad is always looking up, at the sky; why? To see the bird fly. 
^antaire, in whom doubt was creeping, loved to see faith soaring 
in Enjolras. tie had need of Enjolras. Without understanding it 
himself clearly, and without trying to explain it, that chaste, heathy, 
firm, direct, hard, candid nature charmed him. He admired, by in- 
stinct, his opposite. His soft, wavering, .disjointed, diseased, de- 
formed ideas, attached themselves to Enjolras as to a backbone. His 
moral spine leaned upon that firmness. Grantaire, by the side of Em 
jolras, became somebody again. He was himself, moreo-yer, composed 



SS6 IrES MISERABLE S 

of two apparently incompatible elements. He was ironical and 
cordial. His indifference was loving. His mind disi)cnsed with be- 
lief, yet his heart could not dispense with friendship. A thorough 
contradiction; for an affection is a conviction. His nature was so. 
There are men who seem l)orn to he the o|)|»osite, the reverse, the 
counterpart. They are Pollux, Patreudus, Nisus, luidamidas, Hep- 
hsestion, Pechmeja. They live only upon condition of leaning on 
another; their names are continuations, and are only written pre- 
ceded by the conjunction and; their existence is not their own; it is 
the other side of a destiny which is not theirs. ( Irantaire was one of 
these men. Pic was the reverse of Ifnjolras. 

We might almost say that affinities commence with the letters 
of the alphabet. In the series, O and V are inseparable. You can, as 
you choose, pronounce O and P, nr Orestes and Py lades, 

Grantaire, a true satellite of Enjolras, lived in this circle of young 
people ; he dwelt in it ; he took pleasure only in it ; he followed them 
perywhere. Plis delight was t(» see tliese forms coming and going 
in the fumes of the wine. He was tt)Ierateil for his gooddiumour. 

Enjoh-as, being a believer, disdained tliis sceptic, and l&gt;eitig sober, 
scorned this drunkard. He gratited him a little hangluy pity. Gran- 
taire was an unaccepted Pylacles, Always rudely treated" by En- 
jolras, harshly repelled, rejected, yet reUirning, lie said of Enjol-

On a certain afternoon, which had, as we shall see. sonu; coincidence 
with events Iieforc related,! .aigle de H(‘aux: was honing la/.ily back 
against the doorway (»f the Cafe iMusain. l ie !iad the ajipearance

his personal plans for the future-^idans which were, moreover, 
rather indefinite. 

Reverie tioes nut hinder a ealiriulet (rum going by, nor the dreamer 
from noticing the cabriolet* Laigle de JMeaux, wliose eyes were 
wandering in a sort of general stroll, perceived, tlirougli all his som- 
nambulism, a two-wheek‘d vehicle turning into Iht? scjuare, which 
was moving at a walk, us if undecided. What did this cabriolet 
want ? why was it moving at a walk ? ! *aig!e lotiketl at it. There was 
msicle, beside the driver, aytnjng man, and before the young man, a 
large carpet-bag. The bag ex!nbite&lt;I to the passers this mmt[ written 



MARIUS 557 

in big black letters upon a card sewed to the cloth : Marius Pont- 

MERCY. 

This name changed Laigle's attitude. He straightened up and 
addressed this apostrophe to the young man in the cabriolet : 

^‘Monsieur Marius Pontmercy?'^ 

The cabriolet, thus called upon, stopped. 

The young man, who also seemed to be profoundly musing, 
raised his eyes. 

^‘Well?^’ said he. 

^‘You are Monsieur Marius Pontmercy?” 

‘'Certainly.'’ 

“I was looking for you," said Laigle de Meaux. 

“How is that ?" inquired Marius ; for he it was, in fact he had just 
jeft his grandfather's, and he had before him a face which he saw 
for the first time. “I do not know you." 

“Nor I either. I do not know you,” answered Laigle. 

Marius thought he had met a buffoon, and that this was the be- 
ginning of a mystification in the middle of the street. He was not 
in a pleasant humour just at that moment. He knit his brows ; Laigle 
de Meaux, imperturable, continued: 

“You were not at school yesterday." 

“It is possible." 

“It is certain." 

“You are a student?" inquired Marius. 

“Yes, Monsieur. Like you. The day before yesterday I happened 
to go into the school. You know, one sometimes has such notions. 
The professor was about to call the roll. You know that they are 
vei-y ridiculous just at that time. If you miss the third call, they 
erase your name. Sixty francs gone." 

Marius began to listen. Laigle continued : 

“It was Blondeau who was calling the roll. You know Blondeau ; 
he has a very sharp and very malicious nose, and delights in smelling 
out the absent. He slily commenced with the letter P. I was ,not 
listening, not being concerned in that letter. The roll went on well, 
no erasure, the universe was present, Blondeau was sad. I said to 
myself, Blondeau, my love, you won't do the slightest execution 
to-day. Suddenly, Blondeau calls Marius Pontmercy; nobody an- 
swers. Bl6ndeau, -full of hope, repeats louder: Marius Pontmercyf 
And he seizes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels. I said to myself 
rapidly : Here is a brave fellow who is going to be erased. Attehtion. 
This is a real live fellow who is not punctual. He is not a good boy. 
He is not a book-worm, a student who studies, a white-billed pedant, 
strong on science, letters, theology, and wisdom, one of those num- 
skulls drawn out with four pins ; a pin fot each faculty. He is an 
honourable idler who loafs, who likes to rusticate, who cultivates 
the grisetteu who pays his court to beauty, who is perhaps, at this

very moment, with my mistress. Let us save him. Death to Blon- 
deau ! At that moment Blondeau dipped his pen, black with erasures 
into the ink, cast his tawny eye over the room, and repeated for the 
third time: Marius Pontmercy! I answered: Present! In that Way 
you were not erased.” 

“Monsieur ! — ” said Marius. 

“And I was,” added Laigle de Meaux. 

“I do not understand you,” said Marius. 

Laigle resumed : 

“Nothing more simple. I was near the chair to answer, and near 
the door to escape. The professor was looking at me with a certain 
fixedness. Suddenly, Blondeau, w'ho must be the malignant nose of 
which Boileau speaks, leaps to the letter .L. L i.s my letter; I am of 
Meaux, and my name is Lesgle.” 

“L’Aigle !” interrupted Marius, “what a fine natne.” 

“Monsieur, the Blondeau re-echoes this fine name and cries: 
‘Laigle!’ I answer: Present! Then Blondeau looks at me with the 
gentleness of a tiger, smiles, and says : If you arc 1 'ontmercy, you are 
not Laigle. A phrase^ which is uncomplimentary to you, but which 
brought me only to grief. So sa 3 dng, he erases me.” 

Marius exclaimed : 

“Monsieur, I am mortified — ” 

“First of all,” interrupted Laigle, “I beg leave to embalm Blon- 
deau in a few words of feeling eulogy. I .supiK).ser him dead. There 
wouldn’t be much to change in his thinness, his p.n!ene.ss. his cold- 
ness, his stiffness, and his odour. And I .say : Erudimini qtti fndicatis 
terrain. Here lies Blondeau,. Blondeau the Nose, .Blondeau Nasica. 
the ox of discipline, ioj discipline, the Molossus of his orders, the 
angel of the roll, who was straight, square, exact, rigid, honest, and 
hideous. God has erased him as he erased me.” 

Marius resumed : 

“I'am very sorry — ” 

''Young man,” said Laigle of Meaux, "let this be a lesson to you. 
In future, be punctual.” 

“I really must give a thousand excuses.” 

“Never expose yourself again to Wing your neighbour erased.” 

I pi very sorry.” 

Laigle biirst out laughing. 

And I, in raptures ; I was on the brink of being a lawyer, This 
rupture saves me. I rpounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not 
defend the widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No.more toga, 
no more probation. Here is my erasure obtaiaed. It is to you that I 
owe It, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay you a solemn visit of 
thanks Where do you live?” ^ 

“In this cabriolet,” said Marius. 

"A sign of opulence.” replied Laigle calmly. "I ooufratulate you.

MARIUS 

You have here rent of nine thousand francs a year.” 

Just then Cotirfeyrac came out of the cafe. 

Marius smiled sadly. 

“I have been paying this rent for two hours, and I hope to get 
out of it ; but, it is the usual story, I do not know where to go.” 
“Monsieur,” said Courfeyrac, “come home with me.” 

“I should have priority,” observed Laigle, “but I have no home.” 
“Silence, Bossuk,” replied Courfeyrac. 

“Bossuet,” said Marius, “but I thought you called yourself 
Laigle.” 

“Of Meaux,” answered Laigle ; “metaphorically, Bossuet. 
Courfeyrac got into the cabriolet. 

“Driver,” said he, “Hotel de la Porte Saint Jacques.” 

And that same evening', Marius was installed in a room at the 
Hotel de la Porte Saint Jacques, side by side with Courfeyrac. 


Ill 

THE ASTONISHMENTS OF MARIUS 

In a few days, Marius was the friend of Courfeyrac. Youth is the 
season of prompt weldings and rapid cicatrisations. Marius, in Cour- 
feyrac’s presence, breathed freely, a new thing for him. Courfey- 
rac asked him no questions. He did not even think of it. At that_ 
age, the countenance tells all at once. Speech Js useless. There are' 
some young men of whom we might say their physiognomies are 
talkative. They look at one another, they know one another. _ 

One morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly put this question to 
him. 

“By the way, have you any political opinions ? 

“What do you mean ?” said Marius, almost offended at the ques- 
tion. 

“What are you ?” 

“Bonapartist democrat,” _ 

“Grey shade of quiet mouse colour,” said Courfeyrac. 

The next day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius to the Cafe Mu- 
sain. Then he whispered in his ear with a smile: “I must give you 
your admission into the revolution.” And he took him into the 
room of the Friends of the A B C. He presented him to we other 
members, saying in an undertone this simple word which Marius 

did not understand: “A jpupil.” - . , ' , . 

Marius had fallen into a mental wasps nest. Still, although silent , 
and serious, he was not the less winged, nor the less arrned, 

Marius, up to this time solitary and inclined to soliloquy and 
privacy by habit and by taste, was a little bewildered at this flock _ot 
young men about him. All these different progressives attacked him 



S60 tES MISERABLES 

at once, and perplexed him. The tumultuous sweep and sway of all 
these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes 
in the confusion, they went so far from him that he had Some dif- 
ficulty in finding them again. Pie heard talk of philosophy, of litera- 
ture, of ai't, of history, of religion, in a sUde he had not looked for. 
He caught glimpses of strange ai)])caranccs ; and, as he did not bring 
them into perspective, he was not sure that it was not a chaos that 
he saw. On abandoning his grandfather’s opinions for his father’s, 
he had thought himself settled ; he now suspccled, with an.xiety, and 
without daring to confess it to himself, that he was not. The angle 
under which he s:jw all things was beginning to change anew. A cer- 
tain oscillation shook the whole horiztm of his brain. A strange in- 
ternal moving-day. He almost sulTcred from it. 

It seemed that there were to thcse young men no “sacred things.” 
Marius heard, upon every subject, ti singular language annoying to 
his still timid mind. 

A theatre poster presented itself, decorated with the title of a 
tragedy of the old repertory, called classic: “Down with tragedy 
dear to the bourgeois!” cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Coinbe- 
ferre reply. 

“You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie love tragedy, and 
upon that point we nni.st let the bourgeoisie alone. Tragedy iii a wig 
has its rea.son for being, and 1 am not one of those who. in the name 
of .Aiischylus, deny it the right of e.xislencc. 'i'here are rough drafts 
in nature ; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies ; a bill which 
is not a bill, wings which are not wings, fins which are not fins, claws- 
which are not claws, a mournful cry wltich inspires us with the de- 
sire to laugh, there is the duck. Now, since tlie fowl e.xists along with 
the bird, I do not see why classic tragedy .should not e.\ist in tlie face 
of antique tragedy.” 

At another time Marius happened to be passing through the Rue 
Jean Jacques Rousseau between iuijolras and Courfeyrae, 

Courfeyrac took his arm : 

“Give attention. This is the Rue Flatriere, now called Rue fean 
Jacques Rousseau, on account of a singular lioiist-httld which lived 
on it sixty years ago. It consisted of Jean jactpies and 'I'herese. 
From time to time, little creatum were l)oru in it. Thercse brought 
them forth. Jean Jacqutw turned them forth.” 

And Enjolra.s replied with severity : 

“Silence before Jean Jacque.s! 1 admire that mtm. He disowned 
his children; very well; but he adoiHed the people.” 

None of the.se young men uttered tliis word : the emperor, Jean 
Prouvaire alone sometimes said Naixileofi; all the rest stiid Bona- 
parte. Enjolras pronounced Bnanaparte. 

Marius became confu-sedly astonished. Initium sapientm.

IV 

THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN 

Of the conversations among these young men which Marius fre- 
quented and in which he sometimes took part, one shocked him 
severely. 

This was held in the back room of the Cafe Musain. Nearly all 
the Friends of the ABC were together that evening. The large lamp 
was ceremoniously lighted. They talked of one thing and another, 
without passion and with noise. Save Enjolras and Marius, who 
were silent, each one harangued a little at random. The talk of 
comrades does sometimes amount to these harmless tumults. It was 
a play and a fracas as much as a conversation. One threw out 
words which another caught up. They were talking in each of the 
four corners. 

No woman was admitted into this back room, except Louison, 
the dish-washer of the cafe, who passed through it from time to time 
to go from the washroom to the ‘‘laboratory.’’ 

Grantaire, perfectly boozy, was deafening the corner of which . 
he had taken possession, he was talking sense and nonsense with all 
his might ; he cried : 

' T am thirsty. Mortals, I have a dream : that the tun of Heidel- 
berg has an attack of apoplexy, and that I am the dozen leeches 
which is to be applied to it. I would like a drink. I desire to forget 
life. Life is a hideous invention of somebody I don’t know who. It 
doesn’t last, and it is good for nothing. You break your neck to live. 
Life is a stage scene in which there is little that is practical. Happi- 
ness is an old sash painted on one side. The ecclesiast says: all is 
vanity ; I agree with that goodman who perhaps never existed. 
Zero, not wishing to go entirely naked, has clothed ^himself in 
vanity. O vanity! the patching uj) of everything with big words 1 a 
kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, a mountebank is a 
gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a hod- 
carrier is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a 
pterygobranchiate. Vanity has a right side and a wrong side ; the 
right side is stupid, it is the negro with his beads ; the wrong side is 
silly, it is the philosopher with his rags. I weep over one and I laugh 
over the other. That which is called honours and dignities, and even 
honour and dignity, is generally pinchbeck. Kings make a plaything 
of human pride. Caligula made a horse consul; Charles I L made a 
sirloin a knight. Now parade yourselves, then between the consul 
Incitatus and the baronet Roastbeef, As to the intrinsic value of 
people, it is hardly respectable any longer.. Listen to the panegyric 
which neighbours pass upon each other. White is ferocious upon 
white; should the lily speak, how it would fix out the dove? a bigot 



562 lesmis^:rables 

gossiping about a devotee is more vcnonKJiis than the asp and the 
blue viper. It is a pity that I am ignorant, for I would quote you a 
crowd of things, but I don’t know anything. I-'or instance, I always 
was bright; when I was a pupil with (Iros, instead of daubinc 
pictures, I spent my time in pilfering apple.s. So niucli for myself^- 
as for the. rest of you, you are just as good as I am. 1 make fun of 
your iperftvtions, e.\cellenccs, and good (pialilies. hlvcry good quality 
runs into a. defect; economy borders on avarice;, the generous are 
not far from the prodigal, the brave man is close to the bully ;*lie 
who says vejy isious say's slightly sanctimonious; there arc just as 
many vices in virtue as there are holes in the mantle of Diogenes. 
Which do you admire, the slain or the slayer, Gesar or lirutus? 
People generally are for the slayer, llurraii for llrntus! he .slew'. 
That is virtue. Virtue, if it may he, hut folly also. 'I'here are some 
^ueer stains on these great meti. d'he Drutn's wlio .slew tl;esar was

A groan then for England. If I do not admire John Bull, shall I

many is the lymph ; Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over 
Russia? Voltaire admired her. He admired China also. I confess 
that Russia has her beauties, among others a strong despotism ; but 
I am sorry for the despots. They have very delicate health. An Alexis 
decapitated, a Peter stabbed, a Paul strangled, another Paul trampled 
down by blows from the heel of a boot, divers Ivans butchered, 
several Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all that indicates that the 
palace of the Emperors of Russia is in an alarrrling condition of 
insalubrity. All civilised nations offer to the admiration of the 
thinker this circumstance: war; but war, civilised war, exhausts 
and sums up every form of banditism, from the brigandage of the 
Trabucaires of the gorges of Mount Jaxa to the marauding of the 
Camanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. Pshaw! will you tell 
me Europe is better than Asia for all that? I admit that Asia is 
ridiculous ; but I do not quite see what right you have to laugh at the 
Grand Lama, you people of the Occident who have incorporated 
into your fashions and your elegancies all the multifarious ordures 
of majesty, fi*om Queen Isabella's dirty chemise to the chamber- 
chair of the dauphin.' Messieurs humans, I tell you, not a bit of it ! 
It is at Brussels that they consume the most brandy, at Madrid the 
most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most 
wine, at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; 
those are all the useful notions. Paris takes the palm on the whole. 
In Paris, the rag-pickers even are Sybarites ; Diogenes would have 
much rather been a rag-picker in the Place Maubert than a philoso- 
pher in the Piraeus. Learn this also : the wine-shops of the rag- 
pickers are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan 
and the Slaughter-house. Therefore, O drinking-shops, eating shops, 
tavern signs, bar-rooms, tea parties, meat markets, dance houses,

ing." 

Thus Grantaire, more than drunk, spread himself out in words, 
catching up the dishwasher on her way, in his corner of the Musain 
back room, 

Bossuet, extending his hand, endeavoured to impose silence upon 
him, and Grantaire started again still more beautifully: 

"'Eagle of Meaux, down with your claws. You have no effect upon

^‘Silence, capital R!” broke in llossuet, wlio was discussing a 
point of law aside, and who was in«&gt;re than half buried in a string 
of judicial argot, of which here is llic ctuudusiim:

^Mu'ho, plaiiBive nymph,” muttenal Grantaire. 

Close beside (irantaire, at a table whiih was almost silent, a 
sheet of paper, an inkstand and a pen lietwcen two wine glasses, 
announced that a farce was being sketclicd out. Tliis iin|)ortant 
business was carried on in a wliisjHT, and the two heads at work 
touched each other.

MARIUS S6S 

In the corner opposite to Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were play- 
ing dominoes and talking of love. 

"‘You are lucky/' said Joly ; '‘you have a mistress who is always 
laughing." 

“That is a fault of hers," answered Bahorel, “Your mistress does 
wrong to laugh. It encourages you to deceive her. Seeing her gay, 
takes away your remorse; if you see her sad, your conscience 
troubles you." 

“Ingrate ! A laughing woman is so good a thing ! And you never 
quarrel!'; 

“That is a part of the treaty we have made. When we made our 
little Holy Alliance, we assigned to each our own boundary which 
we should never pass. What is situated towards the north belongs 
to Vaud, towards the south to Gex. Hence our peace." 

“Peace is happiness digesting." 

“And you, Jolllly, how do you come on in your falling out with 
Mamselle — ^you know who I mean ?" 

“She sulks with cruel patience." 

“So you are a lover pining away." 

“Alas !" 

• “If I were in your place, I would get rid of her." 

“That is easily said." 

“And done. Isn't it Musichetta that she calls herself ?" 

“Yes. Ah ! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, 
with small feet, small hands, dresses well, white, plump, and has 
eyes like a fortune teller. I am ci-azy about her." 

“My dear fellow, then you must please her, be fashionable, and 
show off your legs. Buy a pair of doeskin pantaloons at Staub's. 
They yield," 

“At what rate ?" cried Grantaire. 

The third corner had fallen a prey to a poetical discussion. The 
Pagan mythology was wrestling with the Christian mythology, The 
subject was Olympus, for which Jean Prouvaire, by very romanti- 
cism* took sides. Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once 
excited, he burst forth, a sort of gaiety characterised his enthusiasm, 
and he was at once laughing and lyric. 

“Let us not insult the gods," said he. “The gods, perhaps, have 
not left us. Jupiter does not strike me as dead. The gods are dreams, 
say you. Well* even in nature, such as it now is, we find all the 
grand old pagan myths again. Such a mountain, with th^-^profile 
of a citadel, like the Vignemarle, for instance, is still to me the 
head-dress of Cybele ; it is not proved that Pan does not come at 
night to blow int^ the hollow trunks of the willows, while he stops 
the holes with his ilngers one after another ; and I have always be- 
lieved that lo had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache." . 

In the last .corner, politics was the subject. They were abusing

of that slieet of paper. ^

It was winter; two logs were crackling in ilu* fireplace. It was

word. The spirit of each is sovereign. A jest suffices to open the 
door to the unlooked for. Theirs are conferences with sharp turns, 
where the perspective suddenly changes. Chance is the director of 
these conversations. 

A stern thought, oddly brought out of a clatter of words, suddenly 
crossed the tumult of speech in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire, 
Bossuet, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing. 

How does a phrase make its way into a dialogue? whence comes 
it that it makes its mark all at once upon the attention of those who 
hear it ? We have just said, nobody knows. In the midst of the uproar 
Bossuet suddenly ended some apostrophe to Combeferre with this 
date : 

'‘The 18th of June, 1815 : Waterloo.’’ 

At this name, Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning on a table with 
a glass of water by him, took his hand away from under his chin, 
and began to look earnestly about the room. 

"Pardieu,” exclaimed Courfeyrac {Parbleti^ at that period, was 
falling into disuse), ‘‘that number 18 is strange, and striking to me. 
It is the fatal number of Bonaparte. Put Louis before and Brumair(j, 
behind, you have the whole destiny of the man, with this expressive* 
peculiarity, that the beginning is hard pressed by the end.” 

Enjolras, till now dumb, broke the silence, and thus addressed 
Courfeyrac : 

“ You mean the crime by the expiation.” 

This word, crime, exceeded the limits of the endurance of Marius, 
already much excited by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo. 

lie rose, he walked slowly towards the map of-France spread out 
upon the wall, at the bottom of which could be seen an island in a 
separate compartment ; he laid his finger upon this compartment and 
said : 

“Corsica. A little island which has made France truly great.” 

This was a breath of freezing air. All was silent. They felt that 
now something was to be said. 

Bahorel, i*eplying to Bossuet, was just assuming a pet attitude. 
Pie gave it up to listen. 

Enjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed upon anybody, and seemed 
staring into space, answered without looking at Marius : 

“France needs no Corisca to be great. France is great because she 
is PrdAiCQ, Q uia nominor 

Marius felt no desire to retreat ; he turned towards Enjolras, and 
his voice rang with a vibration which came from the quivering of his 
nerves : 

“God forbid that I should lessen France ! but it is not lessening 
her to join her with Napoleon. Come, let us talk then. I am a new- 
comer among you, but I confess that you astound me. Where are 
we ? who are we ? who are you ? who am I ? Let us explain ourselves 



568 LESMISiRABLES 

about the emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, accenting the % like 
the royalists. I can tell you tint my grand father does better yet ; he 
says Buonaparte. I thought you were young mcn.» Where is your 
enthusiasm then ? and what do you do with it ? whom do you admire 
if you do not admire the emperor? and what more must you have? 
If you do not like that great man, what groat men would you have? 
He was everything. He was complete. He had in his brain the cube 
of human faculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like 
Caesar, his conversation joined the lightning of I’ascal to the 
thunderbolt of Tacitus, he made history and lie wrote it, his bulletins 
are Iliads, he combined the figures of Newton with the metaphors 
of Mahomet, he left behind him in the Orient words as grand as the 
pyramids, at Tilsit he taught majesty to emperors, at tiic Academy 
of Sciences he replied to I..aplacc, in the fonncil of State he held his 
ground with Merlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of those and to 
the trickery of these, he was legal with the attorneys and sidereal 
with the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one candle when 
two were lighted, he went to the Teinple to cheapen a curtain tassel; 
he saw everything; he knew t'verything; which did not prevent him 
from laughing a goodman’s laugh Iw tlu&gt; cradle of his little child; 
and all at once, startled F.urope listened, armies set themselves in 
march, parks of artillery rolled along, bridges of boats stretched 
over the rivers, clouds of cavalry gallnpt&gt;d in the hurricane, cries, 
trumpets, a trembling of thrones everywhere, the fmntiers of the 
kingdoms oscillated upon the m:ip, the sound of ;i superhuman blade 
was heard leaping from its sheath, men .saw him, him, staiuling erect 
in the horizon with a flame in his hands and a resiiUmdence in his 
eyes, unfolding in the thunder his two wings, the ( Jrand Army and 
the Old Guard, and he wa.s the archangd of war !" 

All were silent, and Enjolras hiiwed his he:td. Silence always has 
something of the effect of an acquiest'ence or of a s(trt of pusliing^o 
the wall. Marius, almost without taking hrealh, continued with a 
burst of enthusiasm : 

“Be ju.*it, mjr friends! to ho the etnpire of such an emperor, what 
a splendid destiny for a people, when that |«-nple is France, and when 
it adds its genius to the genius of such a man ! To appear and to reign, 
to march and to triumph, *to have every capital for a magazine, to 
take his grenadiers and make kings of them, to decree the downfall 
of dynasties, to tran.sfigure Euroite at a double &lt;|uiekstei), so that 
men feel, when you threaten, that you l.ay your hand on the hilt of 
the sword of God, to follow, in a single mti'n, Hannilinl, Ciesar, and 
Charlemagne, to be the people of one who mingles with yotir every 
dawn the glorious announcement t»f a battle gained, to be wakened 
in the morning by the cannon of the Invalides, to hurl into the vault 
of clay mighty words which lilaze for ever, Marengo, Areola, Atis- 
terlitz. Jena, Wagram ! to call forth at every moment coastellations 



MARIUS 569 

of victories in the zenith of the centuries, to make the French Em- 
pire, the successor of the Roman Empire, to he the grand nation 
and to bring forth the grand army, to send your legions flying over 
the whole eartli as a mountain sends its eagles upon all sides, to 
vanquish, to rule, to thunderstrike, to be in Europe a kind of gilded 
people through much glory, to sound through history a Titan trumpet 
call, to conquer the world twice, by conquest and by resplendence, 
this is sublime, and what can l)e more grand ?’’ 

*^To be free,” said ComI)cferre* 

Marius' in his turn l)owed his head : these cold and simple words 
had pierced his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt it vanish 
within him. When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was there no 
longer. Satisfied probably witli his reply to the apotheosis, he had 
gone out, aiul all, except linjolras, had followed him. The room was 
empty. Enjolras, remaining alone with Marius, was looking at him 
seriously. Marius, meanwhile, having rallied his ideas a little, did 
not consider himself beatan; there was still something left of the 
ebullition within him, which doulitless was about to find expres- 
sion in syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, when suddenly they 
heard somelxuly singing as he was going downstairs. It was Com- 
beferre, and what lie was singing is this : 

Si Cesar m’avait &lt;lonn4 
La gloire ct la {?uerrc, 

Et qiifil me fallut quitter 
I /amour dc ma mere, 

Te (lirais an grand Cesar; 

Kepreiuls ion sceptre et ton char, 
j’aime mietix ma m^re, 5 gu6I 
J^aimc mieux ma mere/ 

The wdld and tetulcr accent with which Combeferre sang, ^ave to 
thfs stanza a strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtful and with his 
eyes directed to tlie ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: 
mother—” 

At this moment, he felt Enjolras* hand on his shoulder. 

‘‘Citizen ” said hhijolras to him, ‘‘my mother is the republic/* 

* If Cjesar hud given me 
Cilory and war* 

And if I must ahandon 
The love of my mother, 

I would §ay to great Cies&amp;r: 

Take thy sceptre and car, 

I prefer my mother, ah me! 

I prefer my mother.

RKS AN{;USTA 

That evening left Marius in a profcnind agitation, with a sorrow- 
ful darkness in his soul. He was ex}K‘rienciiig wliat perliai^s the earth 
experiences at the moment when it is furrowed with tlie share that 
the grains of wheat may he sown ; it feels the woiuul alone ; the thrill 
of the germ and the joy of the fruit do not eonu* until later, 

Marius was gloomy. He had hut just attained a faith; could he 
so soon reject it? He deeidcnl within himself that he could nut He 
declared to himself that he would not dottht, and lie began to doubt 
in wSpite of himself. To he between two religions, otie which you have 
not yet abandoned, and another which you have not yet adopted, is 
insupportable ; and twilight is pleasant only to bat-like souls. Marius 
was an open eye, and he n&lt;‘e&lt;lcd the true light. To him the dusk of 
doul)t was harmful. Whatever might he liis d(^sire to stop where he 
was, and to hold fast there, he was irresistibly eornpelkal to continue, 
to advance, to examine, to think, to go fiU'wanl. Where was that 
going to lead him ? he feared, a fter ha ring taken so many steps which 
had brought him nearer to his father, to takt' now any steps which 
should separate them. His deject inn tncreast‘d wit It every reflection 
which occurred to him. Stec|) cliffs n jsr* ubinit him. I le vvas on good 
terms neither with his graml father imr with his friends; rash to^ 
wards the former, Imckwataf lowanls the ruhers ; am! he felt doubly 
Isolated, from old age, and also ivmn ytnitli. 1 le went tin more to the 
Cafe Mu.sain. 

In this trouble in which his mind was [dunged he scarcity gave a 
thought to certain .seriotts phases of &lt;‘.\ist(mce, llie realities &lt;»f life 
do not allow themselves (o be forgmtien. They came and jogged his 
memory sliarply. 

One morning, the ket'|H*r of the houst* imteret! Marius* room, and

“Do you wish me to lend you some r” 

“Never." 

“Have you any clothes ?” 

“What you see.” 

“Have'you any jewellery?” 

“A watch.” 

“A, silver one ?” 

“Gold, here it is.” 

‘ I know a dealer in clothing who will take your overcoat and one 
pair of trousers. 

“That is good.” 

“You will then have but one pair of trousers, one waistcoat, on&lt; 
hat, and one coat. ’ 

“And my boots.” 

“What ? you will not go barefoot ? what opulence !” 

“That will be enough.” 

I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch 

“That is good.” 

“No, it is not good. What will you do afterwards ?” 

“What I must. Anything honourable at least.” 

“Do you know English ?” 

“No.” 

“Do you know German ?” 

“No.” 

“That is bad.” 

“Why?” 

“Becaipe a friend of mine, a bookseller, is making a sort of en- 
cyclopedia, for which you could have translated German or English 
articles. It is poor pay, but it gives a living.” 

“I will learn English and German.” 

“And in the meantime ?” 

“In the meantime I will eat my coats and' my watch.” 

The clothes dealer was sent for. He gave twenty francs for the 
clothes. They went to the watchmaker. He gave forty-five francs 
for the watch. 

I hat is not bad,” said Marius to Courfeyrac, on returning to the 
house ; “with my fifteen francs, this makes eighty friancs.” 

“The hotel bill ?” observed Courfeyrac. 

“Ah ! I forgot,” said Marius. . ' 

The host presented his bill, which must be paid on the spot. It 
amounted to seventy francs. , 

“I have ten francs left;” said Marius. 

“The devil,” said Courfeyrac, “you will have five francs to eat 
while y&lt;5u are learning English, and five francs while you are learn- 
ing German. That will be swallowing a language very rapidly or a 
hundred-sous piece very slowly.” 



572 LES MISERABLES 

Meanwhile Aunt Gillenormanch who was really a kind person on 
sad occasions, had finally unearthed Maritis’ lodgings. 

One morning when Marius came home from the school, he found 
a letter from his aunt, and the .sixty pistoles, that is to say, six hun- 
dred francs in gold, in a sealed hox* 

Marius sent the thirty louis back to his aunt, with a respectful 
letter, in which he tokl her that he had tlie means of living, and that 
he could provide henceforth for all his necessitit‘s. At: that time he 
had three f rancs left. 

The aunt did not inform the grandfather of this refttsal, lest she 
should exasperate him. Indeecl, had he not saitl: ‘*Let nobody ever 
speak to me of thi.s I)lood-drinker?*’ 

Marius left the Porte Saint Jacqtn*s 1 lotel, unvvilliiig to contract 
debt. 



BOOK FIFTH 

THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE 

I 

MARIUS NEEDY 

Life became stem to Marius. To eat his coats and his watch was 
nothing. He chewed that inexpressible thing which is called the cud 
of bitterness. A horrible thing, which includes days without bread, 
nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a 
fire, weeks without labour, a future without hope, a coat out at the 
elbows, an old hat which makes young girls laugh, the door found 
shut against you at night because you have not paid your rent, the 
insolence of the porter and the landlord, the jibes of neighbours, 
humiliations, self-respect outraged, any drudgery acceptable, dis- 
gust, bitterness, prostration — Marius learned how one swallows 
down all these things, and how they are often the only things that 
one has to swallow. At that period of existence, when man has need 
of pride, because he has need of love, he felt that he was mocked at 
because he was badly dressed, and ridiculed because he was poor. 
At the age when youth swells the heart with an imperial pride, he 
more than once dropped his eyes upon his worn-out boots, and ex- 
perienced the undeserved shame and the poignant blushes of misery. 
Wonderful and terrible trial, from which the feeble come out in- 
farnous, from which the strong come out sublime. Crucible into 
which destiny casts a man whenever she desires a scoundrel or a 
demi-god. 

For there are mmiy great deeds done in the small struggles of life. 
There is a determined though unseen bravery, which defends itself 
foot to foot in the darkness against the fatal invasions of necessity 
and of baseness. Noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye sees, 
which no renown rewards, which no flourish of triumph salutes. 
Life, misfortunes, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are battle- 
fields which have their heroes ; obscure heroes, sometimes greater 
than the illustrious heroes. 

Strong and rare natures are thus created ; misery, almost always 
a step-mother, is sometimes a mother ; privation gives birth to power 
of soul and mind;|||istress is the nurse of self-respect ; misfortune 
is a good breast for great souls. 

There was a period in Marius’ life whsn he swept his own hall,

for existence. This is the way in which Marius Pontmercy's life was 
arranged. 

He had got out of the narrowest place; the pass widened a little 
before him. By dint of hard work, courage, perseverance, and will, 
he had succeeded in earning by his labour about seven hundred 
francs a year. He had learned German and English ; thanks to Cour- 
f eyrac, who introduced him to his friend the publisher, Marius filled, 
in the literary department of the bookhouse, the useful role of utility. 
He made out prospectuses, translated from the journals, annotated 
republications, compiled biographies, etc., net^ result, year in and 
year out, seven hundred francs. He lived on this. How? Not badly. 
We are going to tell. 

Marius occupied, at an annual rent of thirty francs, a wretched 
little room in the Gorbeau tenement, with no fireplace, called a 
cabinet, in which there was no more furniture than was indispensable. 
The furniture was his own. He gave three francs a month to the old 
woman who had charge of the building, for sweeping his room and 
bringing him every morning a little warm water, a fresh egg, and a 
penny loaf of bi*ead. On this loaf and this egg he breakfasted. His 
breakfast varied from two or four sous, as eggs were cheap or dear. 
At six o'clock in the evening he went down into the Rue Saint Jac- 
ques, to dine at Rousseau's, opposite Basset's the print dealer's, at 
the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup. He took a six- 
penny plate of meat, a threepenny half-plate of vegetables, and a 
threepenny dessert. For three sous, as much bread as he liked. As 
for wine, he drank water. On paying at the counter, where Madame 
Rousseau was seated majestically, still plump and fresh also in those 
days, he gave a sou to the waiter, and Madame Rousseau gave him 
a smile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous, he had a smile and a 
dinner. 

This Rousseau restaurant, where so few bottles, and so mairy 
pitchers were emptied, was rather an appeasant than a restorant. It 
is not kept now. The master had a fine title ; he was called Rosseau 
the Aquatic. 

Thus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous, his food cost him 
twenty sous a day, which was three hundred and sixty-five francs a 
year. Add the thirty francs for his lodging, and the thirty-six francs 
to the old woman, and a few other trifling expenses, and for four 
hundred and fifty francs, Marius was fed, lodged, and waited upon. 
His clothes cost him a hundred francs, his linen fifty francs, his 
washing fifty francs ; the whole did not exceed six hundred and 
fifty francs. This left him fifty francs. He was rich. He occasionally 
lent ten francs to a friend. Courf eyrac borrowed sixty francs of him 
once. As for fire, having no fireplace, Marius had '^simplified" it. 

Marius always had two complete suits, one old "for every day," 
the other quite new, for special occarioiiC Both were black. He had 



576 LES MISfiRABLES 

but three shirts, one he had on, another in the drawer, the third at 
the washerwoman’s. He renewed them as tliey wore out. They were 
usually ragged, so he buttoned his ccuit to his chin. 

For Marius to arrive at thi.s flourishing condition had required 
years. Hard years, and difficult ones ; those to get through, these to 
climb. Marius had never given up for a .single day. He had under- 
gone everything, in the .shape of privation ; he had done everything, 
except get into debt. He gave himself this credit, that he had never 
owed a sou to anybody, h'or him a debt was the beginning of slavery. 
He felt even tliat a creditor is worse than a master; for a master 
owns only your person, a creditor owns your dignity and can bela- 
bour that. Rather than borrow, he did not eat. He had had many 
days of fasting. Feeling that all extremes meet, and that if we do 
not take care, aba.scment of fortune mtiy leatl to basenes.s of soul, he. 
watched jealously ove’r his pride. Such a habit or such a carriage as, 
in any other condition, would have appeared deferential, seemed 
humiliating, and he braced himself against it. He risked nothing, 
not wishing to take a backward step. He htui ti kind of stern Wush 
upon his face. He was timid even to rudeness. 

In all his trials he felt encouraged and .sometimes even upborne 
by a secret force within. The .soul helps the bo&lt;iy, and at certain 
mometits uplift-s it. It i.s the only birtl wliich sustains its cage. 

By the side of his fathcr'.s name, anoiIuT tiiime was engraven upon 
Marims’ heart, the name of 'I'henardier. Marius, in his enthusiastic 
yet serious nature, .surrounded with a sort tif halo the man to whom, 
as he thought, he owed his father’.s life, that brave sergeant who had 
saved the colonel in the midst of the l)alls ujul bullets of Waterloo. 
He never separated the memory of this man from the memory of 
his father, and he associated them in his veneration. It was a .sort of 
worship with two steps, the high altar for tlie ccdonel. the low one for 
Thdnardier. The idea of the nii.sforttine into which lie knew that 
Th6nardier had fallen and been engulfed, inlensiiieil liis feeling of 
gratitude. Marius had learncel at Mont fermeil of the ruin and bank- 
ruptcy of the unlucky innkeeper, Since then, he !i.id made untold 
effort to get track of him, and to endeavor to find him, in that dark 
abyss of misery in which Thcnardier had di.sapiieared. Marius had 
beaten the whole country ; he had been to Chellcs, to Bondy, to Gour- 
nay, to Nogent, to Lagny. For three years he had been devoted to 
this, spending in these explorations what little money he could spare. 
Nobody could give him any news of Thcnardier ; it was thought he 
had gone abroad. His creditors had sought for him, also, with less 
love than Marius, but with as much imI, and had not been able to 
put their hands on him, Marius blamed and almost hated himself for 
not succeeding in his researches. This was the only debt which the 
colonel had left him, and Marius made it a point of honour to pay 
it, “What,” thought he, “when my father lay dying on th* field of 



MAKIUS S77 

battle, Thdnardier could find him through the smoke and the grape, 
and bring him off on his shoulders, and yet he owed him nothing; 
while I, who owe so much to Thenardier, I cannot reach him in that 
darkness in which he is suffering, and restore him, in my turn, from 
death to life. ■ Oh ! I will find him !” Indeed, to find Thenardier, 
Marius would have given one of his arms, and to save him from his 
wretchedness, all his blood. To see Thenardier, to render some ser- 
vice to Thenardier, to say to him — ^“You do not know me, but I do 
know you. Here I am, dispose of me !” This was the sweetest and 
most magnificent dream of Marius. 


Ill 

MARIUS A MAN 

Marius was now twenty years old. It was three years since he Ijad 
left his grandfather. They remained on the same terms on both sides, 
'without attempting a reconciliation, and without seeking to meet. 
And, indeed, what was the use of meeting? to come in conflict? 
Which would have had the best of it ? Marius was a vase of brass, 
but M. Gillenor,mand ws an iron pot. 

■To tell the truth, Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather’s 
heart. He imagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and 
that this crusty and harsh yet smiling old man, who swore, screamed, 
stormed, and lifted his cane, felt for him at most only the affection, 
at once slight and severe, of the old men of comedy. Marius was 
deceived. There are fathers who do not love their children ; there is 
no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. In reality, we have 
said, M. Gillenormand worshipped Marius. He worshipped him in 
his own way, with an accompaniment of cuffs, and even of blows ; 
but, when the child was gone, he felt a dark void in his heart; he 
ordered that nobody should speak of him again, and regretted that he 
was so well obeyed. At first he hoped that this Buonapartist, this 
Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return. But weefes 
passed away, months passed away, years passed away ; to the great 
despair of M. Gillenormand, the blood-drinker did not reappear! 
“But I could not do anything else than turn hin^. away,” said the 
grandfather, and he asked himself : “If it were to be done again, 
would I do it?” His pride promptly answered Yes, but his old he?id, 
which he shook in silence, sadly answered. No. He had his hours of 
dejection. He missed Marius. Old men need affection as they do 
sunshine. It is warmth. However strong his nature, might be, the 
absence of Marius had changed something in him. For nothing in 
the world would he have taken a step towards the “little rogue;” but 
he suffered. He never inquired after him,, but he thought of him con- 
stantly. He lived, more andmore isefired; m the Marais. He was stiU,

pense of its higher and delicate portions. The poor young man must 
work for his bread ; he eats ; when he has eaten, he has nothing more 
but reverie. He goes free to the play which God gives ; he beholds 
the sky, space, the stars, the flowers, the children, the humanity in 
which he suffers, the creation in which he shines. He looks at hu- 
manity so much that he sees the soul, he looks at creation so much 
that he sees God. He dreams, he feels that he is great ; he dreams 
again, and he feels that he is tender. From the egotism of. the suffer- 
ing man, he passes to the compassion of the contemplating man. A 
wonderful feeling springs up within him, forgetfulness of self, and 
pity for all. In thinking of the numberless enjoyments which nature 
offers, gives, and gives lavishly to open souls, and refuses to closed 
souls, he, a millionaire of intelligence, comes to grieve for the mil- 
lionaires of money. All hatred goes out of his heart in proportion as 
all light enters his mind. And then is he unhappy? No. The misery 
of a young man is never miserable. The first lad you meet, poor as he 
may l)e, with his health, his strength, his quick step, his shining eyes, 
his blood which circulates warmly, his black locks, his fresh cheeks, 
his rosy lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always be envied 
by an old emperor. And then every morning he sets about earning his 
bread ; and while his hands are earning his living, his backbone is 
gaining firmness, his brain is gaining ideas. When his work is done, 
he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joy ; he sees his 
feet in difficulties, in obstacle, on the pavement, in thorns, sometimes 
in the mire ; his head is in the light. He is firm, serene, gentle, peace- 
ful, attentive, serious, content with little, benevolent ; and he blesses 
God for having given him these two estates which many of the 
rich are without ; labour which makes him free, and thought which 
makes him noble. 

This fs what had taken place in Marius. He had even, to tell the 
truth, gone a little too far on the side of contemplation. The day on 
which he had arrived at the point of being almost sure of earning 
his living, he stopped there, preferring to be poor, and retrenching 
from labour to give to thought. That is to say, he passed sometimes 
whole days in tliinking, plunged and swallowed up like a visionary, 
in the mute joys of ecstasy and interior radiance. He had put the 
problem of his life thus: to work as little as possible at material 
labour, that he might work as much as possible at impalpable labour ; 
in other words, to give a few hours to real life, and to cast the rest 
into the infinite. He did not perceive, thinking that he lacked nothing, 
that contemplation thus obtained co-mes to be one of the forms of 
sloth, that he was content with subduing the primary necessities of 
life, and that he was resting too soon. 

It was clear that, for his energetic and generous nature, this 
could only be a transitory state, and that at the first shock against 
the inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would arouse.

Meantime, although he was a lawyer, ami whatever &lt; Ira nd father 
Gillenormand might think, he was not jileafliiig, he was not even 
pettifogging. Reverie had tnrned him ;tway Irum tin; lavv. 'J'o con-

Marius’ life was solit;iry. hVom his fa-ie for remaining outside 
of everything, and also from liaving Iteeii st.'iriled liy its exeesses, 
he had decided not to enter the group presided over hv luijolras.' 
They had remained good friends; tl’ey wnf readv to help one an- 
other, if nee&lt;i were, in all po&gt;..silile ways ; hiit iioihing more, Marius 
had two friends, one young, t 'onrteyrae. and one old, ,\l, .M.-iheuf.

M. Mabeuf’s political opinion was a passionate fondness for plants, 
and a still greater one for books. He had, like everybody else, his 
termination in ist, without which nobody could have lived in those 
times, but he was neither a royalist, nor a Bonapartist, nor a chart- 
ist, nor an Orleanist, nor an anarchist ; he was an old-bookist. 

He did not understand how men could busy themselves with 
hating one another about such bubbles as the charter, democracy, 
legitimacy, the monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in 
this world all sorts of mosses, herbs and shrubs, which they could 
look at, and piles of folios and even of 32mos which they could 
pore over. He took good care not to be useless ; having books did not 
prevent him from reading, being a botanist did not prevent him from 
being a gardener. When he knew Pontmercy, there was this sym- 
pathy between the colonel and himself, that what the colonel did 
for flowers, he did for fruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in pro- 
ducing_ sbedling pears as highly flavoured as the pears of Saint 
Germain ; to one of his combinations, as it appears, we owe the 
October Mirabelle, now famous, and not less fragrant than the 
Summer Mirabelle. He went to mass rather from good-feeling than 
from devotion, and because he loved the faces of men, but hated 
their noise and he found them, at church only, gathered together 
and silent. Feeling that he ought to be something in the government, 
he had chosen the career of a churchwarden. Finally, he had never 
succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb, or any man 
as much as an Elzevir. He had long passed his sixtieth year, when 
one day somebody askgd him ; “Were you never married?” “I for- 
get,” said he. When he happened sometimes — ^to whom does it not 
happen ? — ^to say : “Oh ! if I were rich,” it was not upon ogling a 
pretty girl, like M. Gillenormand, but upon seeing an old book. He 
lived alone, with an old governess. He was a little gouty, and when 
he slept, his old fingers, stiffened with rheumatisrri, were clenched 
in the folds of the clothes. He had written and published a Flora of 
the Environs of Cauteretz with coloured illustrations, a highly es- 
teemed work, the plates of which he owned and which he sold him- 
self. People came two or three times a day and rang his bell, in the 
Rue Mezieres, for it. He received fully two thousand francs a year 
for it ; this was nearly all his income. Though poor, he had suc-- 
ceeded in gathering together, by means of patience, self-denial, and 
time, a valuable collection of rare copies on every subject. He never 
went out Without a book under his arm, and he often came back 
with two. The only decoration of, the four ground-floor rooms 
which, with a small garden, formed his dwelling, were some framed 
herbariums .and a few engravings of old masters. The sight of a 
sword or a gun chilled him. In his whole life, he had never been near 
a cannon, even at the Invalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother 
who was a cur^ hair entirely white, no teeth left either in his

mouth or in hivS mind, tremor of tlie wliole ])ody, a Picard accent 
% childlike laugh, weak nerves, and the a|»|)earance of an old sheep! 
With all that, no other friend nor any tuhcr intimate acquaintance 
among the living, but an old book-s(‘ller of tlie Porti* Saint laccpies 
named Royol. His mania was the naturalisation of indigo in hh-ance. 

His servant was, also, a peculiar variety of inntu’eiu'e. 'Hu* ])oor!

of her dreams went as far as man. She hatl nvna'r gt»t iK^yond her 
cat. She had, like him, moustaches, lier glory was in the whiteness 
of her caps. She spent her time on Sunday after mass in counting 
her linen in her trunk, and in spreading out tipon her hed the dresses 
in the piece which she had laaight and never iuadt‘ up. She could

well. He took advantage of this change to sell nearly all his fur- 
niture. The day of his entrance into this new dwelling, he was very 
^y and drove nails himself on which to hang the engravings and 
the herbariums ; he dug in his garden the rest of the day, and in the 
evening, seeing that Mother Plutarch liad a gloomy and thoughtful 
air, he tapped her on the shoulder and said with a smile : “We have 
the indigo.” 

Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte Saint Jacques and 
Marius, were admitted to his cottage at Austerlitz, a tumultuous 
name which was, to tell the truth, rather disagreeable to him 

However, as we have just indicated, brains absorbed in wisdom, 
or in folly, or, as oHen happens, in both at once, are but very slowly 
permeable by the affairs of life. Their own destiny is far from them 
There results from such concentrations of mind a passivity which, 
if it were due to reason, would resemble philosophy. We decline’ 
we descend, we fall, we are even overthrown, and we hardly perceive 
it. This always^ ends, it is true, by an awakening, but a tardy one. In 
the tneantime, it seems as though we were neutral in the game which 
IS oeing played between our ^ood and our ill fortune. We are the 
stake, yet we look upon the contest with indifference. 

.'Thus it was that amid this darkness which was gathering about 
him, all his hopes going out one after another. Monsieur Mabeuf 
had remained serene, somewhat childishly, but very thoroughly 
His habits of mind had the swing of a pendulum. Once wound up 
by^an illusion, he went a v# ry long time, even when the illusion 
had disappeared. A clock does not stop at the very moment you lose 
the key. 

Monsieur Mabeuf had some innocent pleasures. These pleasures 
were cheap and unlooked-for ; the least chance furnished them. One 
day Mother Plutarch was reading a romance in one corner of the 
room. She read aloud, as she understood better so. To read aloud, 
is to assure yourself of what you are reading. There are people who 
read very loud, and who appear to be giving their words of honour 
for what they are reading. 

It was with that kind of energy that Mother Plutarch was read- 
ing the romance she held in her hand. Monsieur Mabeuf heard, 
but was not listening. 

As she read. Mother Plutarch came to this passage. It 'was about 
an officer of dragoons arid a belle : 

The belle boudo [pouted], and the dragon [dragoon]—” 

Here she stopped to wipe her spectacles. 

"Bouddha and the Dragon,” said Monsieur Mabeuf in an under- 
ton. “Yes, it is true, there was a dragon who, from the depth of his 
cave, belched forth flames from his jaws and was burning up the 
sky. Several stars had already been set on fire by this monster, 
who, besides, had claws like a tiger. Bouddha went into his cave and 



SS4 LES MISJ&amp;RABLES 

succeeded in converting the dragon. Tiiat i.s a good book which 

you are reading there, Mother Plutarch. 'I'hcre is no more beautiful 

kgend.” 

And Monsieur Mabeuf fell into a delicious reverie. 


V 

• POVERTY A GOOD NEKUi nOlTR OK M USURY 

Marius had a liking for this open-hearled old man, who .saw that 
he was being slowly seized by indigence, and who had come gradu- 
ally to be astonished ,at it, without, however, as yet becoming sad. 
Marius met Courfeyrac, and went to .see Monsieur Mabeuf. Very 
rarely, however ; once or twice a monlh, at most. 

It was Marius’ delight to take long walks alone on the outer 
boulevards, or in the Chiunp de Mars, or in the less freipientctl walks 
of the Luxembourg. He sometimes .spent half a day in looking at a 
vegetable garden, at the bcfls f»f .sidad, the fowls on ilie dung-heap, 
and the horse turningthe wheel of the pump. 'I'he passer.s-hy looked 
at him with surprise, and some thought that he h;id a stispicioius 
appearance and an ill-omened m.anner. He was only a poor young 
man, dreaming without an object. 

It was in one of the.se w.ilks that he had discovered the Corheati 
tenement, and its i.solation and elieapiiess being ;in altraetion to 
him, he had taken a room in it. He was wiiiv known in it Iiv the name 
of Monsieur Marius. ^ ' '

I his did not hinder him from multiplying plans, combinations, 



MARIUS 58.S 

scaffoldings, projects for the future. In this condition of reverie, 
an eye which could have looked into Marius^ soul would have been 
dazzled by its purity. In fact, were it given to our eye of flesh to 
see into the conscien.ces of others, we should judge a man much more 
surely from what he dreams than from what he thinks. There is 
will in the thought, there is none in the dream. The dream, which is 
completely spontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and 
the ideal, the form of our mind. Nothing springs more directly and 
more sincerely from the veiy bottom of our souls than our unre- 
flected and indefinite aspirations towards the splendours of destiny, 
In these aspirations, much more than in ideas which are combined,,, 
studied, and compared, we can find the true character of each man. 
Our chimeras are what most resemble ourselves. Each one dreams 
the unknown and the impossible according to his own nature. 

Towards the middle of this year, 1831, the old woman who 
waited upon Marius told him that his neighbours, the wretched 
jondrette family, were to be turned into the street. Marius, who 
passed almost all his days out of doors, hardly knew that he had 
any neighbours. 

“Why are they turned out said he. 

“Because they do not pay their rent; they owe for two terms.’" 

“How much is that ?” 

“Twenty francs,” said the old woman. 

Marius had thirty francs in reserve in a drawer. 

“Here,” said he to the old woman, “there are twenty-five francs. 
Pay for these poor people, give them five francs, and do not tell 
them that it is from me.”

THE SUPPLANTER 

It happened that the regiment to which Lieutenant Th^odule be- 
longed came to be stationed at Paris. This was the occasion of a 
second idea occurring to Aunt Gillenormand. She had, the first 
time, thought she would have Marius watched by Theodule ; she 
plotted to have Thdodule supplant Marius. 

At all events, and in case the grandfather should feel a vague 
need of a young face in the house — ^these rays of dawn are some- 
times grateful to ruins— it was expedient to find another Marius. 
“Yes,” thought she, “it is merely an erratum such as I see in the 
books ; for Marius read Theoduie.” c 

A grandnephew is almost a grandson; for want of a lawyer a 
lancer will do, • ^ 

One morning, as Monsieur Gillenormand was reading' some- 
thing like La Quotidienne, his daughter entered, and said in her 
softest voice, for the matter concerned her favourite : 



586 L E S M I S K R A B L r, S 

‘ *Tather, Thcocliile is conung this innniiiig to present his re- 
spects to you/' 

‘'Who is that, — Thaxlnle?’’ 

‘‘Your grandnephew." 

•‘Ah!" said the grandfather. 

Then he resumed his reading, tliought jin inttre (d* the grand- 
nephew who was nothing natre than any 1'lteiuhilt\ and very soon 
was greatly excited, as was alni(»st always the case when he read. 

The “sheet" which he had, royalist iiuhnnl - that was a matter of 

course, — announced for the next tiny, withnut any mollihcation, 
one of the little daily occurrences ot the Paris id that time; that 
the students of the schools of Law and Mrdicitie wnuUl meet in 
the square of the Pantheon at notm to drlihcrate. 1 lu* ({nestion 
was one t)f the topics of the moment : the artillery of tlie National 
Guard, and a conllict hetween the Minister *d W ar and “ilu? citizen 
militia" on the subject of the eatnnm plantt'd in tin* court of the 
Louvre. The studenl.s were to **dclilH'rate“ tlua'euj&gt;on. it did not 
require much more to enrage Monsieur (hllcuonnanii. 

lie thought of Marins, who Wv-is *'i siniLnt, ami whn, y»ro!)ably, 
would go, like the other.s, “to detiluTute, at nonti, in tin* scpuire of 
the Pantheon." 

While he was dwelling npnii tliis painful thought, Lieutenant 
Thcodnle entered, in citizen’s dress, whicli was adroit, and was 
discreetly introductid 1)y MutlemoisidU’ ( lillcnonuand. The kmcer 
reasoned thus: “The old druid has not put everything into an an- 
nuity. It is well worth while to disguise tmeself in t.atfcla occasion- 
ally." 

Mademoiselle Gillenorntand .s,aid aloud l&lt;.» her father: 

“Theodulc, your grandnei.diew," 

And, in a whisper, to the lieutenant : 

“Say yes to everytliing." 

And she retired. 

The lieutenant, little acc!istuiiu‘d to such venerable c*ncottnters, 
stammered otit with some timidity: “Good morning, uncle/* atul 
made a mixed how comptjsetl of the involuntary atul mechanical 
tiwkwardnes.s of the military salute fmished ot’f with the law of the 
bourgeois. 

“Ah ! it is you ; very well, take a seat/’ saitl the i dd mam 

And then, he entirely forgot the lancer, 

Thcodnle sat down, and Mottsieur t lillenorinand got up. 

Monsieur Gillcnormand began in walk up and down with his 
hands in his pockets, talking aloud, and rubl/mg wiilt his nervous 
old fingers the two watches whiclt he carried in his tw&lt;i waistcoat 
pockets. 

“This mess of snivellers! they meet together in the S&lt;|uare of 
the Pantheon. Virtue of niy cfuean. Scapegraces vesteniay at nurse!

If their noses were squeezed, the milk would run out ! And they 
deliberate at noon to-morrow ! What are we coming to ? what are 
we coming to ? It is clear that we are going to the pit. That is where 
the descamisados have led us ! The citizen artillery ! To deliberate 
about the citizen artillery ! To go out and jaw in the open air about 
the blowing of the National Guard ! And whom will they find them- 
selves with there ! Just see where jacobinism leads to. I will bet 
^anything you j)lease, a million against a fig, that they will all be 
fugitives from justice and discharged convicts. Republicans and gal- 
ley-slaves, they fit like a nose and a handkerchief. Carnot said: 
Where would you have me go, traitor?’ Fouche answered: Wher- 
ever you like, fool !’ That is what republicans are.” 

“It is true,” said Theodule. 

Monsieur Gillenormand turned his head half around, saw Theo- 
dule, and continued. 

“Only to think that this rogue has been so wicked as to turn 
carbonaro ! Why did you leave my house? To go out and be a re- 
publican. Pish ! in the first place the people do not want your re- 
public, they do not want it, they have good sense, they know very 
well that there always have been kings, and that there always will 
be, they know very well that the people, after all, is nothing but the 
people, they laugh at your republic, do you understand, idiot ? Is 
not that caprice of yours horrible ? To fall in love with Pere Duchesne 
to cast sheep’s eyes at the guillotine, to sing ditties and play the 
guitar under the balcony of ’93 ; we must spit upon all these young 
folks, they are so stupid ! They are all in a heap. Not one is out of it. 
If is enough to breathe the air that blows down the street to make 
them crazy. The nineteenth century is poison. The first black- 
guard you will meet wears his. goat’s beard, thinks he is very clever, 
and discards his old relatives. That is republican, that is romantic. 
What is tliat indeed, romantic? have the kindness to tell me what 
that is! Every possible folly. A year ago, yon went to HernanL I 
want to know, Hernani! antitheses ! abominations which are not 
written in French! And then they have cannon in the court of the 
Louvre. Such is the brigandage of these things.” 

“You are right, uncle,” wSaid Theodule. 

M. Gillenormand resumed: 

“Cannon in the court of the Museum ! what for ? Cannon, what do 
you want? Do you want to shoot down the Apollo Belvedere? 
What have cartridges to do with Venus de’ Medici ? Oh 1 these young 
folks nowadays, all scamps ! What a small affair is their Benjamin 
Constant ! And those who are not scoundrels are boobies ! They do 
all they can to be ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of 
women, they appear like beggars about petticoats, which makes the 
wenches burst out laughing ; upon my word, you would say the poof 
fellows are ashamed of love. They are homely, and they finish

and Potier, they have sackcoats, hur,se-jcicke} s' waistcoats, coarse 
cotton shirts, coarse cloth trousers, coarse leather hoots, and their 
jabber is like their feathers. Their jargon would serve to sole their 
old shoes with. And all these foolish brats have jailitical opinions. 
They ought to be strictly forbidden to have any ])olitical opinions. 
They fabricate systems, they reform sociity, tliey di’iiioli.sh mon-

porter in place of the king, they turn Juin»pe topsy-turvy, they re-

women’s legs when they are getting into their carts ! Oh ! Marius! 
Oh! you beggar! going to bawl in a public place! to discass, to de-

“That is cvid&lt;‘nt,’’ said 'riteodule. 

And taking ailvantage of M. &lt; iil!enormand‘s drawiigyi^treath, the 
lancer added magi.sterially : “There ought to !w no journal but the 
Monitcur and no book but the Jnnmire Milihihi'." 

M. Gillenorniand went on. 

“He is like their Sieyes ! a regicide emling ofT as ,a senator ; that 
is always the way they end. 'I'liey slash themsi'Ives with thee-aiid-

guillotine ! I tell you that, my goodmen !” 

“Zounds,” cried the lieutenant, “that is wonderfully true ” 

M. Gillenormand broke off a gesture which he had begun, turned, 
looked the lancer Theodule steadily in the eyes, and said : 

“You are a fool.” 



BOOK SIXTH 

THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS 
I 


THE nickname: moke of KOKMATJON of FAMII.V NAMES 

Marius was now a fine-lookingj ymiiiH; man, of mwlinin height, with 
heavy jet black hair, a higli intelligent brow, large .and passionate 
nostrils, a frank and calm exjjression, and a indeseriliable something 
beaming from every feature, which was at once lofty, thoughtful 
and innocent. His profile, all the lines of which wiTcVotmcle'd, but 
without loss of strength, passes.scd that (iermanic gentleness which 
lias made its way into French physiognomy through Alsace and Lor- 
raine, and that entire absence of angles which rendered the .Sic.ambri 
so recognisable among the Romans, and which distingnislies the 
leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that sea.soii of life at which 
the mind of men who think, is made uii in n&lt;‘:irly equal proportions 
of depth and simplicity. In a dillieidt situation he po.ssessed all the 
essentials of stupidity ; another turn of the screw, and lie could be- 
come sublime. His manners were reserved, cold, jiolished, far from 
free. But as his mouth w.as very [ileasant, his lijis the reddest and 
his teeth the whitest in the world, his smile corrected the .severity of 
his physiognomy. At cert.ain moments there was a strange contra.st 
between this chaste brow and this voluiituotis smile. His eye was 
small, hi.s look great. 

At the time of his most wretched poverty, he noticerl that girls 
turned when he passed, and with a deathly feeling in his heart he fled 
or hid himself. He thought they looked at him on account of his old 
clothes, and that they were laughing at him ; the truth is, that they 
looked at him becau.se of his graceful appearance, and that they 
dreamed over it, 

Thi.s wordless mi.sunderstanding between him and the pretty girls 
he met. Rad rendered him hostile to society. He attached himself to 
none, for the excellent rea.son that he fled before all. Thus he lived 
without aim— like a beast, said Courfeyrac. 

Courfeyrac said to him also: “Aspire not to he a sage (they used 
familiar speech ; familiarity of sjxjech is characteristic of youthful 
friendships). My dear boy, a piece of advice. Read not .so much in 
books, and look a little more upon the Peggie.s. The little rogues are

MARIUS 591 

good for thee, O Marius J By continual flight and blushing thou shalt 
become a brute.” 

At other times Courf eyrac met him with : ‘'Good day, Monsieur 
Abbe.” ^ 

When Courfeyrac said anything of this kind to him, for the next 
week Marius avoided women, old as well as young, more than everj 
and especially did he avoid the haunts of Courfeyrac. 

There were, however, in all the immensity of creation, two women 
from whom Marius never fled, and whom he did not at all avoid. 
Indeed he would have been very much astonished had anybody told 
him that they were women. One was the old woman with the beard, 
who swept his room, and who gave Courfeyrac an opportunity to 
say : ‘'As his servant wears her beard, Marius does not wear his.” 
The other was a little girl that he saw very often, and that he never 
looked at. 

For more than a year Marius had noticed in a retired walk of th^ 
Luxembourg, the walk which borders the parapet of the Pepiniere, 
a man and a girl quite young, nearly always sitting side by side, on 
the same seat, at the most retired end of the walk, near the Rue de 
rOuest. Whenever that chance which controls the promenades of 
men whose eye is turned within, led Marius to this walk, and it-was 
almost every day, he found this couple there. The man might be sixty 
years old ; he seemed sad and serious ; his whole person presented the 
robust but wearied appearance of a soldier retired from active serv- 
ice. Plad he worn a decoration, Marius would have said : it is an 
old officer. His expression was kind, but it did not invite approach, 
and he never returned a look. He wore a blue coat and pantaloons, 
and a broad-brimmed hat, which always appeared to be new ; a black 
cravat, and Quaker linen, that is to say, brilliantly white, but of coarse 
texture. A grisette passing near him one day, said : There is a very 
nice widower. His hair was perfectly white. 

The first time the young girl that accompanied him sat down on 
the seat which they seemed to have adopted, she looked like a girl of 
about thirteen or fourteen, puny to the extent of being almost ugly, 
awkward, insignificant, yet promising, perhaps, to have rather fine 
eyes. But they were always looking about with a disagreeable assur- 
ance. She wore the dre^s, at once aged and childish, peculiar to the 
convent school-girl, an ill-fitting garment of coarse black merino. 
They appeared to be father and daughter. 

. For two or three days Marius scrutinised this old man, who was 
not yet an aged man, and this little girl, not yet a wornan ; then he 
paid no more attention to them. For their part they did not even 
seem to see him. They talked with each other peacefully, and with 
indiflference to all else. The girl chatted incessantly and gaily. The 
old man spoke little, and at times looked upon her with an unutterable 
expression of fatherliness.

MariuH had acquired a surt navhauiv'ul Iiahit oi i&gt;roniena&lt;lhig 
on this walk. He always found theui thert*. 

It was usually thus :

outlines of woman, at the precise moment at which they are yet com- 
bined with all the most charming graces of childhood, — ^that pure and 
fleeting moment which can only be translated by these two words : 
sweet fifteen. Beautiful chestnut hair, shaded with veins of gold, a 
brow which seemed chiselled marble, cheeks which seemed made of 
roses, a pale incarnadine, a flushed whiteness, an exquisite mouth, 
whence came a smile like a gleam of sunshine, and a voice like music, 
a head which Raphael would have given to Mary, on a neck which 
Jean Goujon would have given to Venus, And that nothing might 
be wanting to this ravishing form, the nose was not beautiful, it was 
pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it 
was the Parisian nose ; that is, something sprightly, fine, irregular, 
and pure, the despair of painters and the charm of poets. 

When Marius passed near her, he could not. see her eyes, which 
were always cast down. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, elo- 
quent of mystery and modesty. 

But that did not prevent the beautiful girl from smiling as she 
listened to the white-haired man who was speaking to her, and noth- 
ing was so transporting as thi§ maidenly smile with these downcast 
eyes. 

At the first instant Marius thought it was another daughter of the 
same man, a sister doubtless of her whom he had seen before. But 
when the invariable habit of his promenade led him for the second 
time near the seat, and he hjd looked at her attentively, he recognised 
that she was the same. In six months the little girl had become a 
■young woman; that was all. Nothing is more frequent than this 
phenomenon. There is a moment when girls bloom out in a twinkling, 
and become roses all at once. Yesterday we left them children, to-day 
we find them dangerous. 

She had not only grown ; she had become idealised. As three April 
days are enough for certain trees to put on a covering of flowers, 
so six months had been enough for her to put on a mantle of beSuty. 

We sometimes see people, poor and mean, who seem to awaken, 
pass suddenly fron». indigence to luxury, incur expenses of all sorts, 
and become all at once splendid, prodigal, and magnificent. That 
comes from interest received ; yesterday was pay-day. The young 
girl had received her dividend. 

And then she was no longer the school-girl with her plush hat, her 
merino dress, her shapeless shoes, and her red hands ; taste had come 
to her with beauty. She was a woman well dressed, with a sort of sim- 
ple and rich elegance without any particular style.^ She wore a dress 
of black damask, a mantle of the same, and a white crape hat. Her 
white gloves showed the delicacy of her hand which played with the 
Chinese ivory handle of her parasol, and her silk boot betrayed the 
smallness of her foot. When you passed near her, her whola toilet 
exhaled the penetrating fragrance of youth. 



594 LESMISERABLES 

As to the man, he was still the same. 

The'second time that Marius came near her, the young girl raised 
her eyes ; they were of a deep celestial blue, but in this veiled azure 
was nothing yet beyond the look of a child. She looked at Marius 
with indiffenice, as she would have IcK^ked at any little monkey play- 
ing under the sycamores, or the niarlde vase wliicli cast its shadow 
over the bench ; and Marius also continued his promenade thinking 
of something else. 

He passed four or five times more by the seat wliere the young 
girl was, without even turning his eyes towards her. 

On the following days he came as usual to the Luxembourg, as 
usual he found “the father and daughter** there, hui he paid no* at- 
tention to them. He thought no more of this girl now that she was 
handsome than he had thought of her when she was homely. He 
passed very near the bench on whicli she sat, because that was his 
habit. 

Ill 

KFFliCT OF SIMUNG 

One day the air was mild, the I.uxtinlnmrg was flooded with sun- 
shine and shadow, the sky was as clear as if the angels had washed it 
in the morning, the sparrows were twittering in the depths of the 
chestnut trees, Marius had opened liis wla»le soul to natttre, he was 
thinking of nothing, he was living and Inaathing, lie passed near this 
seat, the young girl raised her ewes, tlieir glances met. 

But what was there now in the glance of tin? young girl ? Marius 
could not have told. There was noilung, and there was everything. 
It was a strange flash. 

She cast down her eyes, and he continued on liis way. 

Vyimt he had seen was not tlie simjile, art less eye of a child ; it was 
a mysterious abyss, half-oiiened, then sudtkmly closcfl. 

There is a time when every young girlknlks thus. Woe to him 
upon whom she looks ! 

This first glance of a sotil which does ni»t yet know itself is like 
the dawn in the sky. It is the awakiming of somtdhing radiant and 
unknown. Nothing can express tlie dangt*rous chasm of this un- 
looked-for gleam which suddenly sulTuses adorable mysteries, and 
which is made up of all the innocence of the {&gt;res(*nt, ami of all the 
passion of the future. It is a kind of irresolute lovingness which is 
revealed by chance, and which is waiting. It is a snare which Inno- 
cence unconsciously spreads, and in which slit* catclies luvarts without 
intending to, and without knowing it. It i.s a maiden glancing like a 
woman. 

It is rare that deep reverie is not l&gt;orn of this glance wherever it 
may fall. All that is pure, and all that is vestal, is concentrated in this 



MARIUS 595 

celestial and mortal glance, which more than the most studied ogling 
of the coquette, has the magic power of suddenly forcing into bloom 
in the depths of a heart, this flower of the shade full of perfumes 
and poisons, which is called love. 

At night, on returning to his garret, Marius cast a look upon his 
dress, and for the first time perceived that he had the slovenliness, 
the indecency, and the unheard-of stupidity, to promenade in the 
Luxembourg with his “every day” suit, a hat broken near the band, 
coarse teamsters’ boots, black pantaloons shiny at the knees, and a 
black coat threadbare at the elbows. 


IV 

COMMENCEMENT OF A GREAT DISTEMPER 

The next day, at the usual hour, Marius took from his closet his 
new coat, his new pantaloons, his new hat, and his new boots ; he 
dressed himself in this panoply complete, put on his gloves, prodig- 
ious prodigality, and went to the Luxembourg. 

On the way, he met Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see him. 
Courf eyrac, on his return home, said to his friends : 

“I have just met Marius’ new hat and coat, with Marius inside. 
Probably he was going to an examination. He looked stupid enough.’’ 

On reaching the Luxembourg, Marius took a turn round the foun- 
tain and looked, at the swans ; then he remained for a long time in 
contemplation before a statue, the head of which was black with 
moss, and which was minus a hip. Near the fountain was a big-bellied 
bourgeois of forty, holding a little boy of five by the hand, to whom 
he was saying: “Beware of extremes, my son. Keep thyself equally 
diwStant from despotism and from anarchy.” Marius listened to this 
good bourgeois. Then he took another turn around the fountain. 
Finally, he went towards “his walk slowly, and as if with regret. 
One would have said that he was at once compelled to go and pre- 
vented from going. He was unconscious of all this, and thought he 
was doing as he did every day. 

When he entered the walk he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl 
at the other end “on their seat.” He buttoned his coat, sti^etched it 
down that there might be no wrinkles, noticed with some complais- 
ance the lustre of his pantaloons, and marched upon the seat. There 
was something of attack in this march, and certainly, a desire of 
conquest. I say, then, he marched upon the seat, as I would say : Han- 
nibal, marched upon Rome. 

Beyond this, there was nothing which was not mechanical in all 
his movements, and he had in no wise interrupted the customary pre- 
occupations of his mind and his labour. He was thinking at that 
moment that the du Baccalauriai a stupid book, and 



596 L E S M I S H A B L K S 

that it must have been cuinpiled by rare old fn( ils, to an analysis 
as of masterpieces of the human mind, of three tra^^edies of Racine 
and only one of Moliere*s comedies. 1 le had a sharp siirt^ing sound 
in his ear. While approaching the seat* he was smoot hing t he wrinkles 
out of his coat, and his eyes were iixe&lt;l (ui tlie young girl It seemed 
to him as though she filled the whole ext remit v of the walk withapale 
bluish light. 

As he drew nearer, his step became shnver and slower. At some 
distance from the seat, long before he had reacluu! tlie (‘ud of the 
walk, he stopped, and he did not know hims^df iunv it hripfiened, but 
he turned back. He did not evtai say to liimself that he wotib! mlt go 
to the end. It was doubtful if the voimg girl cmild see him so fur olf 
tnd notice his iineap])earauce in his new suit. .1 luwevta*, he lield him- 
self very straight, so that he might look well, in case aiiylnuly who 
was behind should happen to notice him. 

He reached the o])|Hjsite end and then returned, atul this time he 
approached a little nearer tt) the seat. ! le even i'ame to within about 
three trees of it, hut there he fell an indescribalde laek of power to 
go further, and he hesitattal. He ihotight he bar! setm the Viumg girl’s 
face bent towards him. Still he made a gr»‘at and nianly’ettVnI, ctm- 
cjuered his hesitatum. and ermtinued his advance. In a few seconds, 
he was passing befoiat the st‘at, erect and liian, hinslnng to his ears, 
without &lt;Iaring to cast a look to the right or the left, and with his 
hand in his coat like a statesman. At the moment lie passed under the 
guns of the fortress, he felt a frigliifut iKilpilatiem of the heart. She 
wore, as on the previous day, her ilamask tlress and !u»r crape hat. 
He heard the sound of aii inelTahle voice, which might he “her voice.*’ 
She was talking quietly. She wnts wry pretty. 1 le felt it, tliough he 
made no elTort to .see ’her. “.She could imt/howevcrA tliought he, 
“but have some esteem and consuieratiou fi*r me, if she knew that 
I was the real aiitlmr the disH&lt;ulatioa on Marcfi^ t )bregou &lt;Ie la

quite near, then turiua! aiul passe^t again befoiH* I lie beautiful girl. 
Iliistime be was very pale. Indeed, he was i-xperieneiug nothing that 
was not v(*ry disa.greeahle. He walked awav from tlie seat and from 
the young girl, and although his Imek was'turnisb he imagined that 
she was looking at him. and that matle liiin stumlde, 

1 fe made no elTort to approach the seat again, lie sn»i*ped midway 

of the walk, and sat down there a thing wliieli lie never did--H‘asting 

many side glances, and thinking, in most indistinct depilis t^f his 
mind, lliat after all it mu.sl be diffienh for persons wlmse wiiite hat 
and black dress he atlmired, to In* alisohndy insensible to Ins glossy 
pantaloons and his new coat. 

At tlie end of a quarter of an hour* he rose, m if ti» recommence 



MARIUS S9T 

his walk towards this seat, which was encircled by a halo. He, how- 
ever, stood silent and motionless. For the first time in fifteen months, 
he said to himself, that this gentleman, who sat there every day with 
his daughter, had undoubtedly noticed him, and probably thought his 
assiduity very strange. 

For the first time, also, he felt a certain irreverence in designat- 
ing this unknown man, even in the silence of his thought, by the nick- 
name of M, Leblanc. 

He remained thus for some minutes with his head down tracing 
designs on the ground with a little stick which he had in his hand. 

Then he turned abruptly away from the seat, away from Monsieuf 
Leblanc and his daughter, and went home. 

That day he forgot to go to dinner. At eight o’clock in the evening 
he discovered it, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Sainf 
Jacques, '*No matter,” said he, and he ate a piece of bread. 

He did not retire until he had carefully brushed and folded his 
coat. 

V 

SUNDRY THUNDERBOLTS FALL UPON MA’aM BOUGON 

Next day. Ma’am Bougon, — ^thus Courfeyrac designated the old 
portress-landlady of the Gorbeau tenement, — Ma’am Bougon — ^her 
name was. in reality Madame Bougon, as we have* stated, but this 
terrible fellow Courfeyrac respected nothing, — Ma’am Bougon was 
stupefied with astonishment to see Monsieur Marius go out again 
with his new coat. 

He went again to the Luxembourg, but did not get beyond his 
seat midway of the walk. He sat down there as on the day previous, 
gazing from a distance and seeing distinctly the white hat, the black 
dress, and especially the bluish light. He did not stir from the seat, 
and did not go home until the gates of the Luxembourg were shut. 
He did not see Monsieur Leblanc and his daughter retire. He con- 
cluded from that that they left the garden by the gate on the Rue de 
rOuest. Later, some weeks afterwards, when he thought of it, he 
could not remember where he had dined that night. 

The next day, for the third time. Ma’am Bougon was thunder- 
struck. Marius w€nt out with his new suit. “Three days running I” 
she exclaimed. 

She made an attempt to f ollow him, but Marius walked briskly 
and with immense strides ; it was a hippopotamus undertaking to 
catch a chamois. In two minutes she lost sight of him, ahd came back 
out of breath, three quarters choked by her asthma, and furious. 
“The silly fellow,” she muttered, “to put on his handsome clothes 
every day and make people run like that!” 

^Marius had goije to the Luxembourg. . 



598 L E S M I S E R A B L E S 

The young girl was there wiih Wunsicur Lchlanc. Marius an- 
proached as near as he could, seeming l&lt;i Ik; reading a book, but I 
was still very far off, then he relumed and sal down on his seat* 
where he spent four hours walehing tin- aidless litile sparrows as 
they hopped along the walk ; they seemed io him to he mockm&lt;r him 

Thus a fortnight rolled away. Marins went to the Ltisembour&lt;r 
no longer to promenade, but to sit down, always in tlie same place’ 
and witliQut knowing why. Onec there be did no'i stir. l‘'.vervmornin? 
he put on his new suit, not to be conspicin ms, and he began' again the 
next morning. “ 

She was indeed of a marvelous beauty. The only remark which 
could be made, that would resemble a critieism, is that the contra- 
diction between her look, whieli was sad, and her smile, which was 
Joyous, gave to her countentince sometiting a little wihl, which pro- 
duced this effect, that at certain moments this sweet face became 
strange without cea.sing to be charming.

On one tif the la.st dav.s o| tiu* .'-(‘contl week, i^larnis wa.s as usual 
sitting on his .seal, liokling in his hand an open book of which he had 
not turned a leaf for two hours. Suddenly he tremhletl, .\ great event 
was commencing at the end of the walk. Monsieur I ..■hl;mc .and his 
daughter had left their seat, the daughter had taken the .arm of the 
father, and they_ were coming slowly towards the mid«ih; of the 
walk where M.arius w.as. .Marius elosis! his book, then he opened it, 
then he. made .an tittempt to read, lie tremltleil. The h.aln w,as com- 
ing straight towards him. “O de.ar!" thought he. 'M sh.all not have 
time to t.ake .an .attitude.” However, the man with the white hair :md 
the young girl wen* advaneing. It seemed t,. him that it would last a 
century, and that it w.as only .a .second. “What ;tre tliev coming by 
here for ?’’ he a.sked hiiiwelf. "What ! is she going to p.ass this place'! 
Are her feet to press this ground in this walk, hut ;i step from me?" 
He was overwht'Imed, he woiikl gladiv h.ave been verv luiiidsome, he 
would gladly have worn the cross of tin* l,egion of Honour. He 
heard the gentle and measured suiiud rd tl*eir appro, aching. 

He imagined that Monsieur Leldauc was hurling angry lotiks upon 
him. 1$ he going to .speak to me ?** Ihought he. He howed his head ; 
when he raised it tliey were cfuite near him, "flu* young girl passed, 
and in passing she looked at him. She looked at liiin sttadily, with a 
sweet and thoughtful look which made Marins tremlife from head 
to foot. It seemed to him that she reproadietl him for liaving been 
•SO lung without emning to her, and lliat slie said : “It is I who come.*' 



MARIUS 599 

Marius was bewildered by these eyes full of flashing light and 
fathomless abysses. 

He felt as though his brain were on fire. She had come to him, 
what happiness 1 And then, how she had looked at him ! She seemed 
more beautiful than she had ever seemed before. Beautiful with a 
beauty which combined all of the woman with all of theangel, abeauty 
which would have made Petrarch sing and Dante kneel. He felt as 
though he was swimming in the deep blue sky. At the same timp he 
was horribly disconcerted, because he had a little dust on his boots. 

He felt sure that she had seen his boots in this condition. 

, He followed her with his eyes till she disappeared, then he began 
to walk in the Luxembourg like a madman. It is probable that at 
times he laughed, alone as he was, and spoke aloud. He was so strange 
and dreamy when near the child’s nurses that every one thought he 
was in love with her. 

He went out of the Luxembourg to find her again in some street. 

He met Courf eyra,c under the arches of the 0.4eon, and said : 
“Come and dine with me.” They went to Rousseau’s and spent six 
francs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave six sous to the waiter. At 
dessert he said to Courfeyrac: “Have you read the paper? "W^t a 
fine speech Audry de Puyraveau has made !” 

He was desperately.in love. 

After dinner he said to Courfeyrac, “Come to the theatre with 
me.” They went to the Porte Saint Martin to see Frederick in L’Au- 
berge des Adrets. Marius was hugely amused. 

At the same time he became still more strange and incomprehens- 
ible. On leaving the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a little 
milliner who was crossing a gutter, and when Courfeyrac said : “I 
would not object to putting that woman in my collection,” it almost 
horrified him. 

Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast next morning at the Cafe 
Voltaire. Marius went and ate still more than the day before. He 
was very thoughtful, and yet very gay. One would have said that he 
seized upon all possible occasions to burst out laughing. To every 
country-fellow who was introduced to him he gave a tender embrace. 
A circle of students gathered round the table, and there was talk of 
the flummery paid for by the government, which was retailed at the 
Sorbonne; thfen the conversation fell upon the faults and gaps in 
the dictionaries and prosodies of Quicherat. Marius interrupted the 
discussion by exclaiming ; “However, it is a very pleasant thing to 
have the Cross.”. 

“He is a comical fellow!” said Courfeyrac, aside to Jean Prou- 
vaire.^ ' ■ ^ 

“No,” replied Jean Prouvaire, “he is serious,” . 

He was serious, indeed. Marius was in. this first vehement and 
fascinating period which the grand pasrion commences. ,

One glance liad done all that. 

When the mine is loaded, aiul the match is ready, nothing is sini|&gt;

It was all over with him. IMarius Invcd a wurnan. His destiny was 
entering upon the unknown.

Isolation, separation from all i»ride. iudejHTtdimce, a taste

whtde avation, had jwepared Marius iiu* tliis jiossesrdon wluch is

an&lt;l. like all religion, had retired inui the de|iihs of his heart lie

A whole month jiassed during which Marius went eviTv day to the 
Luxanhourg, When the hour came, nothing eonld kreii hint away. 
*M lcis out at serviced* said t ourfevrac, Marius lived in transports, 
It i.s emuin that the ymmg girl looked at him, 
iie fmally grew kddiT, ami approached iieariu* |(» the seat. How- 
m'f he jxissed hefore it no mon% oheyitig at once the instinct of

combinations of stations behiml trees and itu* pedestals of statues, 
with consummate art, sc^ as to he setm a** mncfi as possifile by the 
janmggirl and as little as possible bv ilie obi gentleman. Sometimes 
he would stand for half an hour motionless belnnd some la*onidas 
or S]&gt;artacus with a Iniok in his hand, over which Itis eyes, timidly 
raised, were looking for the young girl, while she, for her ixtri, was

turning her charming profile towards him, suifysed with a smile. 
While yet talking in the most natural and quiet way in the world with 
the white-haired man, she rested upon Marius all the dreams of a 
maidenly and passionate eye. Ancient and immemorial art which Eve 
.knew from the first day of the world, and which every woman knows 
from the first day of her life ! Her tongue replied to one and her eyes 
to the other. 

We must, however, suppose that M. Leblanc perceived something 
of this at last, for often when Marius came, he would rise and begin 
to promenade. He had left their accustomed place, and had taken 
the seat at the other end of the walk, near the Gladiator, as if to see 
whether Marius would follow them. Marius did not understand it, 
and committed that blunder. "The father"’ began to be less punctual 
and did not bring ""his daughter” every day. Sometimes he came 
alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder. 

Marius took no note of these symptoms. From the phase of timid- 
ity he had passed, a natural and inevitable progress, to the phase of 
blindness. His love grew. He dreamed of her every night. And then 
there came to him a good fortune for which he had not even hoped, 
oil upon the fire, double darkness upon his eyes. One night, at dusk, 
he found on the seat, which "'M. Leblanc and his daughter” had just 
left, a handkerchief, a plain handkerchief without embroidery, but 
white, fine, and which appeared to him to exhale ineffable odours. 
He seized it in transport. This handkerchief was marked with the 
letters U. F. : Marius knew nothing of this beautiful girl, neither her 
family, nor her name, nor her dwelling ; these two letters were the 
first thing he had caught of her, adorable initials upon which he began 
straightway to build his castle. It was evidently Ixer first name. Ur- 
sula, thought he, what a sweet name ! He kissed the handkerchief, 
inhaled its perfume, put it over his heart, on his flesh in the day-time, 
and at night went to sleep with it on his lips! 

""I feel her whole soul in it !” he exclaimed. 

This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply 
let it fall from his pocket. 

For days, and days after this piece of good fortune, he always ap- 
peared at tiie Luxembourg kissing this handkerchief and placing it 
on his heart. The beautiful child did not understand this at all, and 
indicated it to him by signs, which he did not perceive, 

""Oh, modesty !” said Marius.

EVEN THE INVALIDES MAY BE LUCKY 

Since we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal 
nothing, we must say that once, however, through all his ecstasy. 



602 LES MISERABLES 

^*his Ursula” gave him a very serious i)ang. It was upon one of the 
days when she prevailed upon M. Leljlanc to leave the seat and to 
promenade on the walk, A brisk north wind was l)lowing, which 
swayed the tops of the plane trees. Father and daughter, arm in arm, 
had just passed before Marius’ seat. Marius had risen behind them 
and was following them with his eyes, as it was natural that he 
should in this desperate situation of his heart. 

Suddenly a gust of wind, rather niore lively than the rest, and 
probably intrusted with the little affairs of Sj^ring, ilew down from 
La Pepiniere, rushed upon the walk, enveloped tlie young girl in a 
transporting tremor worthy of the manplis of V^irgil and the fauns 
of Theocritus, and raised her skirt, this skirt more sacred than that 
of Isis, almost to the height of the garter. A limb of exquisite mould 
was seen. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious. 

The young girl had put down lier dress with a divinely startled 
.novement, but he was outraged none the less. True, be was alone in 
the walk. But there might have been somebody tliere. And if any- 
body had been there! could one conceive of sueli a thing? what she 
had done was horrible ! Alas, the poor cliild had dt»ne nothing ; there 
was but one culprit, the wind ; and yet Marius in whom all the Bar- 
tholo which there is in Cherubin was confusedly trembling, was 
determined to be dissatisfied, and was jealous of his shadow. For it is 
thus that is awakened in the human heart, and imposed upon 
man, even unjustly, the l)iller and strange jealousy of the flesh. 
Besides, and throwing this jealousy out of consideradon, tliere was 
nothing that was agreeable to him in the sight of that: beautiful limb ; 
the white stocking of the first woman that came along would have 
given him more pleasure. 

When 'liis Ursula,” reaching the end of the walk, returned with 
M. Leblanc, and passed before tlie s&lt;‘at on which Marius had again 
sat down, Marius threw at her a cross and cruel look, Tlie young 
girl slightly straightened back, with that ek‘valion of the eyelids, 
which says : ‘*Wcll, what is the matter with him ?” 

That was '^their first quarrel.” 

Marius had hardly finished this scene with lier when sorneliody 
came down the walk. It was an Invalide, wry much bent, wrinkled 
and pale with age, in the uniform of Louis XV., with the little oval 
patch of red cloth with crossed swor&lt;ls on his back, the soldier’s 
Cross of Saint Louis, and decorated also by a coat sleeve in which 
there was no arm, a silver chin, and a wooden leg. Marius thought 
he could discern that this man appeared to be very much pleased 
It seemed to him even that the old cynic, as he [lobbied along by him, 
had addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink, as if 
by some chance they had been put into communication and had en- 
joyed some dainty bit of good fortune together. What had he seen 



MARIUS 603 

to be SO pleased, this relic of Mars ? What had happened between this 
leg of wood and the other? Marius had a paroxysm of jealousy. 
“Perhaps he was by !” said he ; “perhaps he saw !” And he would have 
been glad to exterminate the Invalide. 

Time lending his aid, every point is blunted. This anger of Marius 
against “Ursula,” however just and proper it might be, passed away. 
He forgave her at last ; but it was a great effort ; he pouted at her 
three days. 

Meanwhile, in spite of all that, and because of all tliat, his passion 
was growing, and was growing mad. 


IX 

AN ECLII’SE 

We have seen how Marius discovered, or thought he discovered, 
that Her name was Ursula. 

Hunger comes with love. To know that her name was Ursula had 
been much; it was little. In three or four weeks Marius had de- 
voured this piece of good fortune. He desired another. He wished 
to know where .she lived. 

He had committed one blunder in falling into the snare of the 
seat by the Gladiator. He had committed a second by not remaining 
at the Luxembourg when Monsieur Leblanc came there alone. He 
committed a third, a monstrous one. He followed “Ursula.” 

She lived in the Rue de I’Ouest, in the least frequented part of it, 
in a new three-story house, of modest appearance. 

From that moment Marius added to his happiness in seeing her 
at the Luxembourg, the happiness of following her home. 

His hunger increased. He knew her name, her first name, at least, 
the charming name, the real name of a woman ; he knew where she 
lived ; he desired to know who she was. 

One night after he had followed them home, and seen them dis- 
appear at the porte-cochere, he entered after them, and said boldly 
to the porter : — 

“Is it the gentleman on the first floor who has just come in ?” 

“No,” answered the porter. "It is the gentleman on the third.” 

Another fact. This success made Marius still bolder. 

“In front ?” he asked. 

“Faith!” said the porter, “the house is only built on the street.” 

“And what is this gentleman ?” 

“He lives on his income, monsieur. A vety kind man, "who does a 
great deal of good among the poor, though not rich.” 

“What is his name ?” continued Marius. 



604 LES MISfiRABLES 

The porter raised his head, and said : — 

“Is monsieur a detective ?” 

Marius retired, much abashed, but still in great transports. Ke 
was getting on. 

“Good,” thought he. “I know that her name is Ursula, that she is 
the daughter of a retired gentleman, and that she lives there, in the 
third story, in the Rue de I’Oucst.” 

Next day Monsieur Leblanc and his daughter made but a short 
visit to the Luxembourg ; they went away while it was yet broad day- 
light. Marius followed them into the Rue de I’Ouest, as was his cus- 
tom. On reaching the porte-cochere, Monsic'ur T.e.blanc jiassed his 
daughter in, and then stopped, and before (‘iiU'ring himself, turned 
and looked steadily at Marius. 1'hc day after that they did not come 
to the Luxembourg. Marius waited in v.ain all day. 

At nightfall he went to the Rue de FOuest, and saw a light in the 
windows of the third story, ife walked beneath tliesc windows until 
the light was put out. 

The next day nobody at the Luxembourg. IMarius wtiited all day, ' 
and then went to perform his night duty under the windows. That 
took him till ten o'clock in the evening. 1 1 is dinner took care of it- 
self. Fever supports the sick man, and love the kiver. 

Pic passed a week in this way. Monsieur l .etilanc and his daughter 
appeared at the Luxembourg no more. Marius made melancholy con- 
jectures; he dared not watch the porte-cochere &lt;luring the day. He 
limited himself to going at night to gaze tipon the reddish light of the 
windows. At times he saw .shadows moving, .and his heart beat high. 

On the eighth day when he retidusl the house, there w.a.s no light 
in the windows. “What !” said he, “the l.-unp is not yet lighted. But 
yet it is dark. Or they have gone out ?” He waited'till ten o’clock, 
rill midnight. Till one o’clock in the morning. No light appeared in 
the third story windows, and nobody entered the I’lmise. He went 
away very gloomy. 

On the morrow — for he llve&lt;l only f rom morrow to morrow ; there 

was no longer any to-day, .so to spe.ak. to liiin - on the morrow he 

found nobody at the Luxeml)ourg, h&lt;! vvtiited ; at dusk he went to the I 
house. No light in the windows; the blinds were closetl ; the third 
story was entirely dark. 

Marius knocked at the porte-ctwhere ; went in and said to the 
porter : — 

“The gentleman of the third floor?'* 

“Moytxl,” answered the porter. 

Marius tottered, and .said feebly : 

“Since when?” 

“Yesterday." 

“Where does he live now?” 



MARIUS 60 ( 

“I don't know anything about it." 

"'He has not left his new address, then?” 

"No.” 

And the porter, looking up, recognised Marius. 

"What ! it is you !” said he, but decidedly now, "you do keep 
bright look-out.”

THE MINES ANI&gt; THE MINERS 

Every human society has what is callcil in the tlicatres a third sub- 
stage. The social soil is iniiusl every where, soniel iiues f i ir f'ood, some- 
times for evil. These works are in strata ; tliere are uiiper mines and 
lower mines. There is a top and a onttoin in this dark snh-soil which 
sometimes sinks beneath civilisation, ainl which onr indilTerence and 
our carelessness trample underfoot. 'Hie lhicvcIoji:edia, in tlie last 
century, was a mine almost on the surface. 'I'he liark caverns, these 
gloomy protectors of primitive Christianity, were awtuting only an 
opportunity to e.Nplode beneath the Ca'sars, and to lliu.d the human 
race with light. For in these sacreil shades then* is latent light. Vol- 
canoes are full of a blacknes.s, capable of flashing tlanies. All lava 
begins at midnight. The catacombs, where the first mass was said, 
were not merely the cave of liome; they were the cavern of the 
world. 

There is under the .social structure, this complex wonder of a 
mighty burrow, — of excavations of every kind. There is the religious 
mine, the philosophic mine, the political mine, tlu; economic mine, 
the revolittionary mine. 'rhi.s pick with an idea, that i&gt;ick with 
a figure, the other pick with a vengeance, 'riiey call and they answer 
from one catacomb to another. Utopias travel nnder ground in the 
passages. They branch out in every ilireetion. They .sometimes meet 
there and fraternize. Jean Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who 
lends liim his lantern. .Sometimes they fight. C.’alvin takes Socinius 
by the hair. But notinng checks or inlerni|)ls the tension of all these 
energies towards their object. Tlu: vast sinniltaneous activity, which 
goes to and fro, and up and down, and up again, in these, ilusky re- 
gions, and which slowly transforms tlte tipjier through the lower, 
and the outer through the inner ; vast unknown swarming of workers. 
Society has hardly a .suspicion of this work of uiulennining which, 
without touching its surface, changes its .suhst.ance. So many subter- 
ranean degrees, .so many differing labours, .so many varying e.xcava- 
tion.s. What comes from all thi.s det:p delving? 'I'he future. 

The deeper we .sink, the more my.sterious arc the workers. To a 
degree which social phiIo.sophy can recognise, the work is good ; be- 
yond this degree it is doubtful and mixed ; below, it becomes terri- 

606 



MARIUS 607 

ble. At a certain depth, the excavations become impenetrable to the 
soul of civilisation, the respirable limit of man is passed; the exis- 
tence of monsters becomes possible. 

The descending ladder is a strange one ; each of its rounds cor- 
responds to a step whereupon philosophy can set foot, and where we 
discover some one of her workers, sometimes divine, sometimes 
monstrous. Below John Huss is Luther ; below Luther is Descartes ; 
below Descartes is Voltaire; below Voltaire is Condorcet; below 
Condorcet is Robespierre ; below Robespierre is Marat ; below Marat 
is Babeuf . And that continues. Lower still, in dusky confusion, at the 
limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible, glimpses are 
caught of other men in the gloom, who perhaps no longer exist. 
Those of yesterday are spectres ; those of to-morrow are goblins. 
The embryonary work of the future is one of the visions of the 
philosopher. 

A foetus world in limbo, what a wonderful profile ! 

Saint Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries. 

Indeed, although an invisible divine chain links together all these 
subterranean pioneers, who almost always believe they are alone, yet 
are not. their labours are very diverse, and the glow of some is in 
contrast with the flame of others. Some are paradisaic, others are 
tragic. Nevertheless, be the contrast what it may, all these workers, 
from the highest to the darkest, from the wisest to the silliest, 
have one thing in common, and that is disinterestedness. Marat, like 
Jesus, forgets himself. They throw self aside; they omit self; they 
do not think of self. They see something other than themselves. They 
have a light in their eyes, and this light is searching for the.abso- 
lute. The highest has all heaven in his eyes ; the lowest, enigmatical 
as he may be, has yet beneath his brows the pale glow of the infinite. 
Venerate him, whatever he may do, who has this sign, the star-eye. 

The shadow-eye is the other sign, • 

With it evil commences. Before him whose eye has no light, reflect 
and tremble. Social order has its black miners. 

There is a point where undermining becomes burial, and where 
light is extinguished. 

Below all these mines which we have pointed out, below all these 
galleries, below all this immense underground venous system of 
progress and of utopia, far deeper in the earth, lower than Marat, 
lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without any connection 
with the upper galleries, is the last sap. A fear-inspiring place. This 
is what we have called the third substage. It is the grave of the depths. 
It is the cave of the blind Inferi. 

This conmnmicates with the gulfs.

We will condense in a few words a portion of what we have just 
said. The only social peril is darkness. 

Humanity is identity. All men are the same clay. No difference, 
here below at least, in predestination. The same darkness before, the 
same flesh during, the same ashes after life. But. ignorance, mixed 
with the human composition, blackens it. This incitrable ignorance 
possesses the heart of man, and there becomes Evil.

BABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE 

A QUARTETTE of baiidits, Claqucsous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Mont- 
parnasse, ruled from 1830 to 1835 over the third sub-stage of Paris. 

Gueulemer was a Hercules without a pedestal. His cave was the 
Arche-Marion sewer. He was six feet high, and had a marble chest, 
brazen biceps, cavernous lupgs, a colossus’ body, and a bird’s skull. 
You would think you saw the Farnese Hercules dressed in duck 
pantaloons and a cotton-velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, built in this 
sculptural fashion, could have subdued monsters ; he found it easier 
to become one. Low forehead, large temples, less than forty, the foot 
of a goose, coarse short hair, a bushy cheek, a wild boar’s beard ; 
from this you see the man. His muscles asked for work, his stupidity 
would have none. This was a huge lazy force. He was an assassin 
through nonchalance. He was thought to be a creole. Probably there 
was a little of Marshal Brown in him, he having been a porter at 
Avignon in 1815. After this he had become a bandit. 

The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the meatiness of Gueul- 
emer. Babet was thin and shrewd. He was transparent, but impene- 
trable. You could see the light through his bbnes, but nothing through 
his eye. He professed to be a chemist. He had been bar-keeper for 
Bobcche, and clown for Bobino. He had played vaudeville at Saint 
Mihiel. He was an affected man, a great talker, who italicised hi? 
smiles and quoted his gestures. His business was to sell plaster bust? 
and portraits of the “head of the Government” in the street. More* 
over, he pulled teeth. He had exhibited monstrosities at fairs, and 
had a booth with a trumpet and this placard : “Babet, dental artist, 
member of the Academies, physical experimenter on metals and 
metalloids, extirpates teeth, removes stumps left by other dentists. 
Price: one tooth, one franc fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; 
three teeth, two francs fifty centimes.' Improve your opportunity.” 
(This “improve your opportunity /’.meant: “get as rnany pulled as 
possible.”) He had been married, and had had children. What had 



610 LES MISEEABLES 

become of his wife and children, he did not know. He had lost them 
as one loses his pocket-handkerchief. A remarkable exception in the 
obscure world to which he belonged, Babet read the papers. One day, 
during the time he had his family with him in his travelling booth' 
he had read in the Messenger that a woman had been delivered of a 
child, likely to live, which had the face of a calf, and he had ex- 
claimed : ^^There is a piece of good luck ! My wife hasn't the sense to 
bring me a child like that/* Since then, he had left everything, '*to 
take Paris in hand.” His own expression. 

What was Qaqiiesous? Pie was night. Pjcforc showing himself, 
he waited till the sky was daubed witli black. At night he came out of 
a hole, which he went into again before day. Where was this hole? 
Nobody knew. In the most perfect obscurity, atid to his accomplices, 
he always turned his back when he spoke. Was his name Claquesoiis ? 
No. He said : “My name is Nothing-at-all.” If a candle was brought 
he put on a mask. Pie was a ventrilociuist. Balxit said : 'Xlaquesous 
is a night-bird with tzvo voices/' Claquesous was restless, roving, 
terrible. It was not certain that he had a name, Clac[ucsous being a 
nickname ; it was not certain that he had a voice, his chest speaking 
oftener than his mouth,* it was not certain that he had a face, no- 
bodyhaving ever seen anything but thi.s mask. He disappeared as if 
he sank into the ground; he came like an apparition. 

A mournful sight was Montpartiassc. Montparnasse was a 
child ,* less than twenty, with a pretty face, lips like cherries, charm- 
ing black locks, the glow of spring in his eyes ; he had all the vices and 
aspired to all the crimes. The digestion of what was bad gave him an 
appetite for what was worse. He was the gamin turned vagabond, 
and the vagabond become an assassin. He was genteel, effeminate, 
graceful, robust, weak, and ferocious. Pie wore his hat turned upon 
the left side, to make room for the tuft of hair, according to the 
fashion of 1829. He lived by robbery. His coat was the most fash- 
ionable cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was a fa.shic)n-plate liv- 
ing in distress and committing murders. The cause of all the crimes 
of this young man was his desire to be well dressed. Hie first grisette 
who had said to him : “You are handsome,” had tlirown the stain of 
darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel. Thinking 
that he was ^ndsome, he had desired to be elegant ; now the first of 
elegances is idleness : idleness for a poor man is crime. Few prowlers 
were so much feared as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had already 
left several corpses on his track. More than one traveller lay in the 
shadow of this wretch, with extended arms and with his face in a 
pool of blood. Frizzled, pomaded, with slender waist, hips like a 
woman, the bust of a Prussian officer, a hmz of admiration about 
him from the girls of the boulevard, an elaborately-tied cravat, a 
slung-shot in his pocket, a flower in his button-hole ; such was this 
charmer pf the sepulchre.

IV 

COMPOSITION OF THE BAND 

These four bandits formed a sort of Proteus, winding through the 
police and endeavouring to escape from the indiscreet glances of 
Vidocq ^‘under various form, tree, flame, and fountain/^ lending 
each other their names and their tricks, concealing themselves in their 
own shadow, each a refuge and a hiding-place for the others, throw- 
ing off their personalities, as one takes off a false nose at a masked 
ball, sometimes simplifying themselves till they are but one, some- 
times multiplying themselves till Coco Lacour himself took them for 
a multitude. 

These four men were not four men ; it was a sort of mysterious 
robber with four heads preying upon Paris by wholesale ; it was the 
monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society. 

By means of their ramifications and the underlying network of 
their relations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse, . 
controlled the general lying-in-wait business of the Department of 
the Seine. Originators of ideas in this line, men of midnight imagina- 
tion came to them for the execution. The four villians being furnished ^ 
with the single draft they took charge of putting.it on the stage.* 
They worked upon scenario. They were always in condition to fur- 
nish a company proportioned and suitable to any enterprise which 
stood in need of aid, and was sufficiently lucrative. A crime being in 
search of arms, they sublet accomplices to it. They had a company 
of actors of darkness at the disposition of every cavernous tragedy. 

They usually met at nightfall, their w:aking hour, in the waste 
grounds near La Salpetriere. There they conferred. They had the 
twelve dark hours before them ; they allotted their employ. 

Patron-Minette, such was the name which was given in subter- 
ranean society to the association of these four men. In the bid, popu- 
lar, fantastic language, which now is dying out every Patron- 
Minette means morning, just b.s entre chien et hup [between dog 
and wolf ] , means night. This appellation, Patron-Minette, probably 
came from the hour at which their work ended, the dawn being the 
moment for the disappearance of phantoms and the separation of 
bandits. These four were known by this title. When the Chief Judge 
of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in prison, he questioned him in rela- 
tion to some crime which Lacenaire denied. ‘^Who did do it?” asked 
the judge. Lacenaire made this reply, enigmatical to the magistrate^ 

but clear to the police : 'Tatron-Minette, perhaps/' • 

Sometimes a play may be imagined from the announcement of 
the characters : so, too, we may almost understand what a band is ; 
from the list of the bandits. We give, for these names are preserved 



612 LES MIS ENABLES 

in the docimients, the appellations to wliioh the principal subordinates 
of Patron-Minette responded : 

Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille. 

Briijon. (There was a dynasty of Brujons ; we shall say something 
about it hei’eafter.) 

Boulatruelle, the road-mender, already introduced. 

Laveuve. 

Finistere. 

Plomer Hogtt, negro. 

Mai'disoir.

Poussagrive. 

Carmagnolct, 

Krtiideniers, alias Bizarro. 

Mangedentelle. 

Les-p i eds-en-1 ’air. 

Dcmi-Iiard, alias Deux-iuilliards. 

Etc., etc. 

Wc pass over some of them, and not tlie worst. I'liesa names have 
faces. They express not only lieings, but speci&lt;‘S. hlach of tliese names 
answers to a variety of these shapeless tiiadstools of ilie cellars of 
civilisation. 

These beings, hy^ no means free with their faces, were not of those 
whom we see passing in the streets, Duriitg the day, wearied out by 
their savage nights, they went away to sleep, stmu'limes in the par- 
get-kilns, sometimes in the abandrined quarrii‘s of Montmartre or 
Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. 1‘!H*y burrowetl. 

Wliat has become of these men ? Unw st ill e^ist. ’Phey have always 
existed, Horace sj)eaks of them : AmhnfHtiamm pkarmacO’- 

poIa% matdici, minur ; and so long as sendety shall !m wliat it is, they 
will be what they are. Under the dark vault of their cave, tluy are 
for ever reprodnc(‘d from the m/A) cd society, d’hey return, spectres, 
always the vsame ; but they bear the .same name no longer, and they 
are no longer in t he .same .skims. 

The individuals extirpated, the tribe still e.Kists, 

They have always the same faculties, l^’roni beggar to the prowler 
the race pres&lt;frvt.‘s its |&gt;urity, lliey tliviue purses in pockets, they 
scent watches in fobs. Gold and silver to them are odorous. There 
are simide bourgeois of whom you might .say that they have a tobable 
appearance, The.se men follow the.se liourgeois patiently. When a 
foreigner or a countryman pa.sses by they have spider thrills. 

Such men, when, towards midnight, on a lone boulevard, you meet 



MARIUS , 613 

ihem or catch a glimpse of them, are terrifying. They seem not men, 
but forms fashioned of the living dark; you would say that they are 
generally an integral portion of the darkness, that they are not 
distinct from it, that they have no other soul than the gloom, and that 
it is only temporarily and to live for a few minutes a monstrous life, 
that they are disaggregated from the night. 

What is required to exorcise these goblins ? Light. Light in floods^^ 
No bat resists the dawn. Illuminate the bottom of society.

MARIUS, LOOKING FOR A GIRL WITH A HAT, MEETS A MAN WITH 

A CAP 

Summer passed, then autumn ; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc 
nor the young girl had set foot in the Lu.xemboui'g. Marius had now 
but one thought, to see that sweet, that adorable face again. He 
searched continually; he searched everywhere: he found nothino-. 
He was no longer Marius the enthusiastic dreamer, the resolute 
man, ardent yet firm, the bold challenger of destiny, the brain which 
projected and built future upon future, the young heart full of plans 
projects, prides, ideas, and desires ; he was a lost dog. He fell into a 
melancholy. It was all over with him. Work disgusted him, walking 
fatigued him, solitude wearied him, vast nature, once so full of 
forms, of illuminations, of voices, of counsels, of perspectives, of 
horizons, of teachings, was now a void before him. It seemed to him 
that everything had disappeared. 

He was still full of thought, for he could not be otherwise ; but 
he no longer found pleasure in his thoughts. To all which they were 
silently but incessantly proposing to him, he answered in the gloom- 
Wliat is the use ? 

He reproached himself a hundred times. Why did I follow her? 
I was so happy in seeing her only ! She looked upon me ; was not that 
infinite ? She had the appearance of loving me. Was not that every- 
thing? I desired to have what? There is nothing more after that. I 
was a fool. It is my fault, etc., etc. Courfeyrac, to whom he confided 
nothing; that was his nature; but who found out a little of every- 
thing ;_ that was his natui-e also; had begun by felicitating him upon 
being in love, and wondering at it withal ; then seeing Marius fallen 
into this melancholy, he had at last said to him : “I see that you have 
been nothing but an animal. Plere, come to the Cabin.” 

Once, confiding in a beautiful September sun, Marius allowed him- 
self to be taken to the Bal de Sceaux, by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and 
Grantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might possibly find her 
there. We need not say that he did not see her whom he sought. “But 
yet it IS hCTe that all the lost women are to be found,” muttered 
Grantaire. Manus left his friends at the ball, and went back on foot, 
alone, tired, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes, in the night, over- 
come by the noise and dust of the joyous coaches full of singing

parties who passed by him returning from the festival, while he, dis- 
couraged, was breathing in the pungent odour of the walnut trees . 
by the wayside, to restore his brain. 

He lived more and more alone, bewildered, overwhelmed, given 
up to his inward anguish, walking to and fro in his grief like a wolf 
in a cage, seeking everywhere for the absent, stupefied with love. 

At another time, an accidental meeting produced a singular effect 
upon him. In one of the little streets in the neighbourhood of the 
Boulevard des Invalides, he saw a man dressed like a labourer, wear- 
ing a cap with a long visor, from beneath which escaped a few locks 
of very white hair. Marius was struck by the beauty of this white 
hair, and noticed the man who was walking with slow steps and 
seemed absorbed in painful meditation. Strangely enough, it ap- 
peared to him that he recognised M. Leblanc. It was the same hair, 
the same profile, as far as the cap allowed him to see, the same man- 
ner, only sadder. But why these working-man’s clothes ? what did 
that mean? what did this disguise signify? Marius was astounded. 
When he came to himself, his first impulse was to follow the man; 
who knows but he had at last caught the trace which.he was seeking ? 
At all events, he must see the man again nearer, and clear up the 
enigma. But this idea occurred to him too late, the man was now 
gone. He had taken some little side-street, and Marius could not find 
him again. This adventure occupied his mind for a few days, and 
then faded away. ‘‘After all/’ said he to himself, “it is probably only 
a resemblance.” 


II 

A WAIF 

Marius still lived in the Gorbeau tenement. He paid no attention to 
anybody there. 

At this time, it is true, there were no occupants remaining in the 
house but himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once paid, 
without having ever spoken, however, either to the father, or to the 
mother, or to the daughters. The other tenants had moved away or 
died, or had been turned out for not paying their rent. 

One day, in the course of this winter, the sun shone a little in the 
afternoon, but it was the second of February, that ancient Candle- 
mas-day whose treacherous sun, the precursor of six weeks of cold, 
inspired Matthew Laensberg with these two lines, which have de- 
servedly become classic ' 

Qu’il luise ou qu’il luiseme. 

Lours rentre eii sa caveme.* 

'Let it gleam or let it glimmer, 

The bear returns into his cave. 



616 LESMISERABI-ES 

Marius had just left his; night was falling. It was his dinner hour* 
for it was still necessary for him to go to dinner, alas ! oh infirniitv 
of the ideal passions. ’ ’ ^ 

He had just crossed his door-sill which Ma'am Tlniigon was sweep- 
ing at that very moment, muttering at the same time this meniorable 
monologue : ‘ 

“What is there that is cheap now ? everything is dear. There is 
nothing but people’s trouble that is cheap ;'lhat comes for nothin^ 
people’s trouble.” n juun^, 

Marius went slowly up the boulevard towards the harrierc, on the 
way to the Rue Saint Jacrpies. He was walking thoughtfuli’v with 
his head down. ' v&gt; * 

Suddenly he felt that he was elbowed in the dusk ; he turned and 
saw two young girls in rags, one tall and slender, the oilier a little 
shorter, passing rapidly by, breathless, frightened, ami apiuircntly 
m flight; they had met him, had not seen liim, and had jostled him 
in pa.ssing. Marius could see in the twilight tlieir livid faces their 
hair tangled and flying, their frightful bonnets, their tattered .skirts 
and their naked feet. As they ran they wt*re talking to eaeli other. The 
taller one said in a very 1 ow voice : 
‘‘'rheco/7«cjcaine.TIieyjn.stmi.-sed/'/Hrcriueat flief/cmf-ccrr/e” 

The other answered: *‘I .saw tliem. 1 A/vn/t*. amth'. aivalc" ’ 
Marins understood, through this dismal tinrot, that the gendarmes 
or the city police, had not .sneceeiled in sei/iiig these two Ldrls and’ 
that the girls had e.seaped. ‘ ' 

They plunged in ttnder the trees of ilu* houlevanl liehind him 
and for a few .seconds made a kitid of dim ivhiteness in the obscurity 
whtch soon faded out. ' ^ 

Marius stopped for a mnmetit. 

He wasahottt to resttme Ids ctmrse wlteii lie perceived a little grey- 
ish packet on the ground at Ills feet. He .stoojied tiown and picked it 
envelojie which a[&gt;peared to cont.'tin p.aper.s, 
Good, .said he, “those ptKjr eretitures must have »lropped this!” 
lie letracetl his steps, he called, fie «lid not tiutl theni; he con- 
cluded they were alreatly hej'ond hearing, put the packet in liis 
pocket and went to dinner. 

On his way, in an alley on tlie Rue MotHTefard, he saw a child’s 
comn covered^itli a hkack cloth, placed upon three chttirs and lighted 
by a candle. 1 he two girls of the twiliglit returned to his min&lt;l. 

Po«ir niother.s,” thought he. “Tlieri* is one tiling .sadder than to 
see their children die— to sec them le.ml evil lives.” 

1 hen these shadows which had varied Ins .sadness went out from 
his uiouglits, and 1 r* MI imek mtn liis cnstuniary train, lie began to

ghouls.” 


Ill 

QUADRIFRONS 

In the evening, as he was undressing to go to bed, he happened to 
feel in his coat-pocket the packet which he had picked up on the 
boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought it might be well to open 
it, , and that the packet might, perhaps contain the address of the 
young girls, if, in reality, it belonged to them, or at all events the 
information necessary to restore it to the person who had lost it. 

He opened the envelope. 

It was unsealed and contained four letters, also unsealed. 

The addresses were upon them. 

All four exhaled an odour of wretched tobacco. 

The-first letter was addressed: To Madame, Madame the Mar^ 
chioness de Grucheray, Square opposite the Chamber of Deputies, 
No. — 

Marius said to himself that he should probably find in this letter 
the information of which he was in search, and that, moreover, as 
the letter was not sealed, probably it might be read without impro- 
priety. 

It was in these\words : 

‘'Madame the Marchioness : 

“The virtue of kindness and piety is that which binds sosiety 
most closely. Call up your Christian sentiment, and cast a look of 
compassion upon this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and at- 
tachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy, which he has paid for 
with his blood, consecrated his fortune, wholy, to defend this cause» 
and to-day finds himself in the greatest missery. He has no doubt 
that your honourable self will furnish him assistance to preserve 
an existence extremely painful for a soldier of education and of 
honour full of wounds, reckons in advance upon the humanity 
which animmates you and upon the interest which Madame the Mar- 
chioness feels in a nation so unfortunate. Their prayer will not be 
in vain, and their memory will retain herr charming souvenir. 

“From my respectful sentiments with which I have the honour to 

“Madame, 

“Don Alvares, Spanish captain of cabalry, royalist refuge 
. ip France, who finds himself traveling for his country and 
ressources fail him to continue nis travells.” 



618 LES MISKRaBLKS 

No address was added to the sigiiaturr. Marius ho|)ed to find the 
address in the second letter the superscription of which ran: to 
Madame, Madame the Comtess de Mimnrrnet, Kue Cassette, No 
9 , Marius read as follows: 

‘^Madame the Comtess, 

*Mt IS an unfortunate niothur of a family t»f six cliildrcm the last 
of whom is only eight months old. Me sick ^iiua* inv last lvin&lt;^-iii

“In the hope of Madame the Cointesse, sin* lias tlu* honour to lie, 
Madame, with a profound resptxi, 

**M*tthrr ih\Ll/,AKl&gt;;'' 

Marius ])assed to the third lettm\ which was, like the iuasa*din|y, a 
begging one ; it read : 

“Monsieur Pabourgeot, elector, wlmlcsile nicrchant niillimT, 
Rue Saint Denis, corner of the Khie aux kers. 

“I take the liberty to atidress you this letter tt» pray you to accord 
me the preliotis favour of ymir simpathies and to imn’est yiui in a 
man of letters who lias just sent a drama to ilu* 'riu-atre P'rain^ais. 
Its subject is hislorical, and tlu' action takes place in Auvergne in 
the time of the empire: its style, I be!ir\e, is natural, laconic, and 
perhaps has some merit. 1'here are verses to lie smi;; in four ]&gt;laces. 
The comic, the serious, t!u? unforeseen, mingle tliemst'lves with the 
variety of the characters and with a tint of rcunance sfiread lightly 
over all the plot wliich advances misterionslv. and by striking tvrns, 
to a denouement in the midst of several hits of splendirl scenes, 

“My principal iibject is to satisde the i!e%ire whicfi animates pro-

to render as perfect as possible, will be sent to you before being in- 
serted in the beginning of the drama and given upon the stage. 

"To Monsieur and Madame Pabourgeot, 

My most respectful homage, 

"Genflot, man of letters. 

"P. S. Were it only forty sous. 

"Excuse me for sending my daughter and for not presenting my- 
self, but sad motives of dress do not permit me, alas ! to go out ’’ 

Marius finally opened the fourth letter. There was on the ad- 
dress: To the beneficent gentleman of the church of Saint Jaques 
du Haiit Pas. It contained these few lines : 

"Beneficent man. 

"If you will deign to accompany my daughter, you will see^a 
misserable calamity, and I will show you itiy certificates. 

"At the sight of these writings your generous soul will be moved 
with a sentiment of lively benevolence, for true philosophers always 
experience vivid emotions. 

"Agree, compassionate man, that one must experience the most 
cruel necessity, and that it is very painful, to pbtain relief, to have 
it attested by authority, as if we were not free to suffer and to die 
of inanition while waiting for some one to relieve our missery. The 
fates are very cruel to some and too lavish or too careful to others. 

"I await your presence or your offering, if you deign to make it, 
and I pray you to have the kindness to accept the respectful senti'# 
ments with which I am proud to be, 

"Truly magnanimous man, 

"Your very humble 

And very obedient servant, 

"P. Fabantou, dramatic artist/' 

After reading these four letters, Marius did not find himself 
much wiser than before. 

In the first place none of the signers gave his address. 

Then they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don 
Alvares, Mother Balizard, the poet Geriflot, and the dramatic artist 
Fabantou ; but, strangely enough, these letters were all four v&lt;rritten 
in the same hand. ^ ^ ^ 

What was the conclusion from that, unless that they came Iropi 
the same person ? 



620 ' ‘ LES MISKRABLES 

Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture still more probable 
the paper, coarse and yellow, was the same in all four, the odour of 
tobacco was the same, and although there was an evident endeavour 
to vary the style, the same fatilts of orthugrapliy were reproduced 
with a very quiet certainty, and Genilot, tlic man of letters, was no 
more free from them than the Spanish ca[)tain. 

, To endeavour to unriddle this little mystery was a useless labour. 
If it had not been a waif, it would have had the a|)j)earance of a 
mystification. Marius was too sad to take a joke kindly even from 
chance, or to lend himself to the game whicli tlie stia^et pavement 
seemed to wish to play with him. It api&gt;eared to him that he was 
like Colin Maillard among the four letters, which were mocking 
him. 

Nothing, however, indicated that tlu‘se let t(‘rs belonged to the girls 
whom Marius had met on the btjulevard. After all, they were but 
waste paper evidently without value. 

Marius put them back into the envt*lnpe, tlirew it into a corner 
and 'went to bed. * 

About seven o’clock in the morning, h&lt;‘ had got up and break- 
fasted, and was trying to set about his work wlien there was a 
gentle rap at his door. 

^ As he owned nothing, he n(‘ver locket! his tltnir, except some- 
times, and that very rarely, whtJU he was al&gt;t»ut some pressing 
piece of work. And, indeed, even whtii al»sent, lie left his key in 
the lock, “You will be robbed,” said Ma’am lk)Ugon. “Of what?” 
said Marius. The fact is, however, that one tlay somebody had 
stolen an old pair of boots, to the great tritimph of Ma’am Bougon. • 

There was a second rup, very gentle like the first, 

“Come in/* said Marius, 
door opened, 

“What do ytni want. Ma’am Bougon?^’ asked Marius, without 
raising his eyes from the hooks anti pa|H‘rs which he hacl on his 
ial)le. 

A voice, which was not Ma’am lU&gt;ug&lt;tn’s, answered : 

“I beg your |&gt;ar&lt;i(m, Monsieur— ^” 

It was a hollow, crackeii, .srnotluu’etl, rasping voic&lt;*, the voice 
of an old man, roughened !&gt;y brantiv ant! by liquors. 

Marius turned quickly and saw a ybimg girl. 


IV 

A RO,SH IN MISERY 

A GIRL who was quite young, was standing in the half-opened door. 
Ihe little nnuul window through which the light found its way 
into the garret was exactly oiijmsite the &lt;!oor, ami lit up this form 



MARIUS 621 

with a pallid light. It was a pale, puny, meagre creature, nothing 
but a chemise and a skirt covered a shivering and chilly nakedness. 
A string for a belt, a string for a head-dress, sharp shoulders pro- 
truding from the chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, dirty 
shoulder-blades, red hands, the mouth open and sunken, some teeth 
gone, the eyes dull, bold, and drooping, the form of. an unripe 
young girl and the look of a corrupted old woman ; fifty years joined 
with fifteen; one of those beings who are both feeble and horrible 
at once, and who make those shudder whom they do not make weep. 

Marius arose and gazed with a kind of astonishment upon this 
being, so much like the shadowy forms which pass across our 
dreams. 

The most touching thing about it was that this young girl had 
not come into the world to be ugly, In her early childhood, she must 
have even been pretty. The grace of her youth was still struggling 
against the hideous old age brought on by debauchery and poverty. 
A remnant of beauty was dying out upon this face of sixteen, like 
fte pale sun which is extinguished by frightful clouds at the dawn of 
a winter’s day. 

Th^ face was not absolutely unknown to Marius. He thought he 
remembered having seen it somewhere. 

* What do you wish, mademoiselle ?” asked he. 

The young girl answered with her voice like a drunken galley- 
slave’s : 

■‘‘Here is a letter for you. Monsieur Marius.” 

She called Marius by his name ; he could not doubt that her busi- 
ness was with him ; but what was this girl ? how did she know his 
name ? 

Without waiting for an invitation, she. entered. She entered 
lesolutely, looking at the whole room and the unmade bed with a 
sort of assurance which chilled the heart. She was barefooted. Great 
holes in her skirt revealed her long limbs and her sharp knees. She 
was shivering. 

She had really in her hand a letter which she presented to Marius. 

Marius, in opening this letter, noticed that the enormously large 
wafer was still wet. The message could not have come far. He read : 

“My amiable neighbour, young man ! 

“I have lerned your kindness towards me, that you have paid 
my rent six months ago. I bless you, young man. My eldest daughter 
will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two 
days, four persons, and my spouse sick. If I am not desseived by 
my thoughts, I think I may hope that your generous heart will 
soften at this exposure and that the desire will subjugate you of 
being propitious to me by deigning to lavish upon me some Ught gift. 



622 LES MISKRABLES 

“I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the 
benefactors of humanity, 

“JONDRETTE 

"P. S. My daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur 
Marius.” 


This letter, in the midst of the oliscure accident which had oc- 
cupied Marius’s thoughts since the previous evening, was a candle 
in a cave. Everything was suddenly cleared up. 

This letter came from the .same sotirce as the other four. It was 
the same writing, the same style, the .same orthography, the same 
paper, the same odour of tobacco. 

There were five missives, five stories, five names, five signatures, 
and a single signer. The Spanish Captain Don .Alvares, the unfor- 
tunate mother Balizard, the dramatic poet (lenilnt, the old comedy 
writer Fabantou, were all four named Jondrelte, if indeed the name 
of Jondrette himself was jondrette. 

During the now rather long lime that Marius had lived in the 
tenement, he had had, as we have said, but very few opportunities 
to see, or even catch a glimp.se of his very poor neighbours. His 
mind was elsewhere, and where the mind’is. thither tlu* eyes are 
directed. He must have met the Jomlrettt-s in the i);is.sage aiul on the 
stairs, more than once, but to him they were only .shadows ; he had 
taken so little notice that on the previous evening he had brushed 
again-st the Jondrette girls uixm the boulevard without recognising 
them; for it was evidently they; and it was with great difficulty 
that this girl, who had just come into his room, bad awtikened in him, 
beneath his disgust and pity, a vague remembrance of having met 
with her elsewhere. 

Now he .saw everything clearly. Me understood that the occupa- 
tion of his neighbour Jondrette in his &lt;Iistres.s w;is t«» work upon the 
sympathies of benevolent jwrsoa.s ; that he procured their atkiresses, 
ind that he wrote under a.sstimed names letters to people whom ht 
deemed rich and compa.ssionat«, which his daughter.s carried, at 
:heir risk and peril ; for thi.s father was oiu! wlm risked his daughters 
he was playing a game with destiny, and he put them into the stakt 
Maritis understood, to judge by tiieir flight in the e^^ening, l)y theu 
hreathles.sness, by tlicir terror, by those worths of argot which he 
had heard, that probably these unfortunate things were carrying 
on also some of the .secret trades of darkne.s.s, and that from all 
this the result was, in the niid.st of hiintan society constituted as it 
IS, two miserable heing.s who were neither children, nor girls, nor 
women, a species of impure yet innocent monsters produced by 
misery. 

Sad creatures without name, without age, without sex, to whom 



MARIUS 623 

neither good nor evil were any longer possible, and for whom, on 
leaving childhood, there is nothing more in this world, neither lib- 
erty, nor virtue, nor responsibility. Souls blooming yesterday, faded 
to-day, like those flowers which fall in the street and are bespattered 
by the mud before a wheel crushes them. 

Meantime, while Marius fixed upon her an astonished and sor- 
rowful look, the young girl was walking to and fro in the room with 
the boldness of a spectre. She bustled about regardless of her naked- 
ness. At times, her chemise, unfastened and torn, fell almost to her 
waist. She moved the chairs, she disarranged the toilet articles on 
the bureau, she felt of Marius’ clothes, she searched over what there 
was in the corners. 

‘Ah,” said she, “you have a mirror !” 

And she humrned, as if she had been alone, snatches of songs, 

■ light refrains which were made dismal by her harsh and guttural 
voice. Beneath this boldness could be perceived an indescribable 
constraint, restlessness, and humility. Effrontery is a shame. 

Nothing -was more sorrowful than to see her amusing herself, 
and, so to speak, fluttering about the room with the movements of a 
bird which is startled by the light, or which has a wing broken. You 
feel that under other conditions of education and of destiny, the gay 
and free manner of this young girl might have been something 
sweet and charming. Never among animals does the creature which 
is born to be a dove change into an osprey. That is seen only among 
men. 

Marius was reflecting,, and let her go on. 

She went to the table. 

“Ah !” said she, “books !” 

A light flashed through her glassy eye. She resumed, and her 
tone expressed that happiness of being able to boast of something, 
to which no human creature is insensible : 

“I can read, I can.” 

She hastily caught up the book which lay open on the table, and 
read fluently: 

“ General Bauduin received the order to take five battalions of 

his brigade and carry the chateau of Hougomont, which is in the 
middle of the plain of Waterloo 

She stopped: 

“Ah, Waterloo ! I know that. It is a battle in old times, My father 
was there ; my father served in the armies. We are jolly good Bona?* 
partists at home, that we are. Against English, Waterloo is.” 

She put down the book, took up a pen, and exclaimed : ' 

“And I can write, too!” ^ 

She dipped the pen in the ink, and turning towards Marius : 

“Would you like to see? Here, I am going to write a word to 
show.”

Marius Inul drawn kick quietly,

liacket* whidt is ymirs, I think. IVniiil me to rtium it to you.** 
And he handed her tlie envelope, which contained the four let-* 
teri. 

She clapped her hands and eaciaitned:

MARIUS 

'We have looked everywhere V 

Then she snatched the packet, and opened the envelope, saying i 

'"Lordy, Lordy, haven't we looked, my sister and I ? And yon 
have found it ! on the boulevard, didn't you? It must have been on 
the boulevard? You see, this dropped when we ran. It was my 
brat of a sister who made the stupid blunder. When we got home, 
we could not find it. As we did not want to be beaten, since that is 
needless, since that is entirely needless, since that is absolutely 
needless, we said at home that we had carried the letters to the 
persons, and that they told us : Nix! Now here they are, these poor 
letters. And how did you know they were mine ? Ah, yes 1 by the 
writing! It was you, then, that we knocked against last evening. 
We did not see you, really ! I said tumy sister : Is that a gentleman ? 
My sister said : — I think it is a gentleman !" 

Meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed '"to^the 
beneficent gentleman of the church Saint Jacques du Haut Pas.'" 

'T-Iere !" said she, ''this is for the old fellow who goes to mass. 
And this too is the hour. I am going to carry it to him. He will give 
us something perhaps for breakfast." 

Then she began to laugh, and added : 

"Do you know what it will be if wc have breakfast to-day ? It will 
be that we shall have had our breakfast f cr day before yesterday, our 
dinner for day before yesterday, our breakfast for yesterday, oiir 
dinner for yesterday, all that at one time this morning. Yes ! zounds ! 
if you're not satisfied, stuff till you burst, dogs !" 

This reminded Marius of what the poor girl had come to his 
room for. 

He felt in his waistcoat, he found nothing there. 

The young girl continued, seeming to talk as- if she were no 
longer conscious that Marius was there present. 

"Sometimes I go away at night. Sometimes I do not come back. 
Before coming to this place, the other winter, we lived under the 
arches of the bridges. We hugged close to each other so as npt to 
freeze. My little sister cried. How chilly the water is ! When- 1 
thought of drowning myself, I said : No ; it is too cold. I go all alone 
when I want to, I sleep in the ditches sometimes. Do you know, at 
night, when I walk on, the boulevards, I see the trees like gibbets, I 
see all the great black houses like the towers of Notre Dame, I 
imagine that the white walls are the river, I say to myself : Here, 
there is water there ! The stars are like illumination lamps, one would 
say that they smoke, and that the wind blows them out, I am con- 
fused, as if I had horses breathing in my ear ; though it is night, I 
hear hand-organs and spinning wheels, I don't know what. I think 
that somebody is throwing stones at me, I run without knowing it, it 
is all a whirl, all a whirl. When one has not e^ten, it is very queer/^ 

And she looked at him with a ivandering eye.

MARIUS 627 

cling together, and almost grow together like a mineral formation, 
in that dark promiscuity of sexes, of relationships, of ages, of in- 
fancy, of innocence. They crouch down, back to back, in a kind of 
fate-hovel. They glance at one another sorrowfully. Oh, the unfor- 
tunate ! how pallid they are ! how cold they are ! It seems as though 
they were on a planet much further from the sun tVian we. 

This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the 
night. 

She revealed to him an entire and hideous aspect of the darkness. 

Marius almost reproached himself with the fact that he had 
been so absorbed in his reveries and passion that he had not until now 
cast a glance upon his neighbours. Paying their rent was a mechani- 
cal impulse ; everybody would have had that impulse ; but he, Marius, 
should have done better. What ! a mere wall separated him from 
these abandoned beings, who lived by groping in the night without 
the pale of the living ; he came in contact with them, he was in some 
sort the last link of the human race which they touched, he heard 
them live or rather breathe beside him, and he took no notice of them ! 
every day at every moment, he heard them through the wall, walking, 
going, coming, talking, and he did not lend his ear! and in these 
words there were groans, and he did not even listen, his thoughts 
were elsewhere, upon dreams, upon impossible glimmerings, upon 
loves in the sky, upon infatuations ; and all the while human be- 
ings, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people. Were 
suffering death agonies beside him! agonising uselessly; he even 
caused a portion of their suffering, and aggravated it. For had they 
had another neighbour, a less chimerical and more observant neigh- 
bour, an ordinary and charitable man, it was clear that their poverty 
would have been noticed, their signals of distress would have been 
seen, and long ago perhaps they would have been gathered up and 
saved 1 Undoubtedly they seemed very depraved, very corrupt, very, 
vile, very hateful, even, but those are rare who fall without becoming 
degraded ; there is a point,'moreover, at which the unfortunate and 
the infamous are associated and confounded in a single word, a 
fatal word, Les MisSrables; whose fault is it? And then, is it not 
when the fall is lowest that charity ought to be greatest ? ' • 

While he thus preached to himself, for there were times when 
MariuSj like all truly honest hearts, was his own monitor, and 
scolded himself more than he deserved, _he looked at the wall which 
separated him from the Jondrettes, as if he could send his pitying 
glance through that partition to warn those unfortunate beings. 
The wall was a thin layer oi plaster, upheld by laths and joists, 
through which, as we have just seen, voices and words could be 
distinguished perfectly. None but the dreamer, Marius, would not 
have perceived this before. There- was no paper htmg on this wall, 
either on the side of the Jondrettes, or on Marius’ side; its coarse 



628 LES MISEEABEES 

construction was bare to the eye. Almost unconsciously, Marius 
examined thivS partition ; sometimes reverie examines, observes and 
scrutinises, as thought would do. Suddenly he arose, he noticed 
towards the top, near the ceiling, a triangular hole, wliere three laths 
left a space between them. Tlie plaster whicli should have stopped 
this hole was gone, and by getting upon the- bureau he could see 
through that hole into the Jondreltes’ garret. I’ily has and should 
have its curiosity. This hole was a kind of Judas. It is kiwful to look 
upon misfortune like a betrayer fur thi' sake of relieving it. ‘‘Let 
us see what these ixsoplc are,” thought Marius, “and to what they 
are reduced.” 

He climbed upon the bureau, put his eye to the crevice, and, 
looked.

Tim wii,n M.^^i IN' ni.s i.aik 

CmE.s, like forests, have their dens in which hide all their vilest and 
most terrible monsters. Jhit in cities, what hidi‘s thus is fer.u-ioas, 
unclean, and petty, tli.at is to say, ugly; in forests, whiit hides is 
ferocious, sava,ge, and grand, that is lo’say, beautiful. Den for den, 
tho.se of beasts are jireferable to tho.se of men. C averns are better 
than the wretched holes which shelter huin.anity. 

What Marius saw was a hole. 

_ Marius was poor and his room was jKJorly furnislnsl, hut even as 
hi.s poverty wtis noble, his garret w;is de.aii.’ The tlen into which his 
eyes were at that moment directed, w,as tthjeet, filthy, fetid, in- 
fectious, gloomy, unclean. All the funiiliire was a straw chair, a 
rickety Jable, a few old Iiroken dishes, and in two of the eonu-rs two 
indescribable pallets; all the light eanu- from a tiormer window of 
four panes, curtained with spiders’ webs, just enough light came 
through that loophole to make a man's fitce ttppear like the face 
of a phantom. I'he wtills had a leitnuts look, and were eovtired with 
seams and .scars like a face disfigured by some horrible niala«ly; a 
putrid moisture oozed from them. Ob.seeiie pictures could In: dis- 
covered upon them coarsely sketclied in ehureoal. 

J he room which Marius oceuj&gt;iet! luid a broken brick pavement ; 
this one wtis neither pyetl jior floored ; t!ie inmates walked imme- 
diately upon the old pla.ster»iig of the ruinous tenement, which had 
grown black iindcT their feet. U|«in this uneven soil wliere (lui dust 
was, as it were, incnisted, and which was virgin soil in resiiect 
only of the Imitnu, were groiijied at raiwloin eonsK'llations of .socks, 
old shoes, and hideous rags ; however, this room liad a lire|»!aee ; so it 
rented for forty fnmes a year. In the fireplace there was a little of 
everything, a chafing-dish, a kettle, some broken boards, rags hang- 



' MARixjs 629 

ing on nails, a bird cage, some ashes, and even a little fire. Two 
embers were smoking sullenly. 

The size of this garret added still more to its horror. It had pro- 
jections, angles, black holes, recesses under the roof, bays, and 
promontories. Beyond were hideous, unfathomable corners, which 
seemed as if they must be full of spiders as big as one's fist, centi- 
pedes^as large as one's foot, and perhaps even some unknown mom 
sters of humanity. 

One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. 
Each had one end next the chimney and both were opposite Marius.. 
In a corner near the opening through which Marius was looking, 
hanging upon the wall in a black wooden frame, was a coloured 
engraving at the bottom of which was written in large letters : THE 
DREAM. It represented a sleeping woman and a sleeping child, 
the child upon the woman’s lap, an eagle in a cloud with a crown 
in his beak, and the woman putting away the crown from th^ 
child’s head, but without waking ; in the background Napoleon if j 
a halo, leaning against a large blue column with a yellow capital 
adorned with this inscription : 

Maringo 

Austerlits 

Iena 

Wagramme 

Elot 

Below this frame a sort of wooden panel longer than it was widt 
was standing on the floor and leaning at an angle against the wall. E 
had the appearance of a picture set against the wall, of a frame prob* 
ably daubed on the other side, of a pier glass taken down from a waif 
and forgotten to be hung again. 

By the table, upon which Marius saw a pen, ink, and paper, v/ar- 
seated a man of about sixty, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a keen, 
cruel, and restless air ; a hideous harpy. 

Lavater, if he could have studied this face, would have found 
in it a mixture of vulture and pettifogger ; the bird of prey and the' 
man of tricks rendering each other ugly and complete, the man of 
tricks making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making the 
man of tricks horrible. 

This man had a long grey beard. He was dressed in a woman’s 
chemise, which showed his shaggy breast and his naked arms bris- 
tling with grey hairs. Below this chemise were a pair of muddy pan 
taloons and boots from which the toes stuck out. . , 

He had a pipe in his mouth, and was smoking. There was no more 
bread in the den, but there was tobacco. 



630 , LES MISERABLES 

He was writing, probably some such letter as those which Marius 
had read. 

On one corner of the table was an old odd volume with a reddish 
cover, the size of which, the old duodecimo of series of books, be^ 
trayed that it was a novel. On the cover was dis])la\'ed the following 
title, printed in huge capitals : GO D, TM E K 1 N ( i, 1 1 ON OUR AN D 
THE LADIES, BY DUCRAY DLIMINIL, 1814, 

As he wrote, the man talked aloud, and Marius heir-d his words: 

**To think that there is no equality even when wc are dead ! Look 
at Pere Lachaise! The great, those wlu&gt; are ricli, are in the upper 
part, in the avenue of the acacias, whicli is paved. Tlicy can go 
there in a carriage. The low, the poj)r, the unfortunate, they are put 
in the lower part, where there is mud up to the knees, in holes, in 
the wet. Tliey arc put there so that tluy may rot sootier! You 
cannot go to see them without sinking into the ground.’’ 

Here he stopped, struck his fist on the table, and added, gnashing 
his teeth : 

! I could eat the world !” 

A big woman, who might have been forty ytMrs old or a hundred, 
was squatting near the fireplace, ujion her hare feet. 

She also was dressed only in a chemise and a knit skirt patched 
with pieces of old cloth, A coarse tow apron covered half the skirt 
Although this woman was bent and drawn up into lierself, it could 
be seen that she was very tall. She was a kind of giantess liy the side 
of her husband. She had hideous hair, light red sprinkled with 
grey, that she pushed back from time to time with lier luigc shining 
hands which had flat nails. 

Lying on the ground, at her side, wide open, was a volume of the 
same appearance as the other, and prohalily of tlu* same novel. 

Upon one of the pallets Marins could discern a sort of slender 
little wan girl seated, almost naked, with her feet hanging clown, 
having the appearance neither of listening, nor o{ seeing, nor of 
living. 

The younger sister, doubtless, of the one who iiad come to his 
room. 

vShe appeared to be elevett or twelve years old. C)n examining her 
attentively, he saw that she must lie fourteen, ft was the child who, 
the evening before, on the boulevard, saicl: *4, cavalL* cavale, aw- 
alir 

She was of that sickly species which long remain backward, then 
pushes forward rapidl}% and all at; once* Tliese sorry human plants

nor youth. At fifteen they appear to !&gt;e twelve ; at sixteen they ap- 
pear to be twenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One 
would say that they leap through life, to have done with it sooner. 

This being now had the appearance? of a cliild. 



MARIUS 631 

Nothing, moreover, indicated the performance of any labour in 
this room ; not a loom, not a wheel, not a tool In one corner a few 
scraps of iron of an equivocal appearance. It was that gloomy idle- 
ness which follows despair, and which precedes the death-agony. 

Marius looked for some time into that funereal interior, more 
fearful than the interior of a tomb ; for here were felt the move- 
ments of a human soul and the palpitation of life. 

The garret, the cellar, the deep ditch, in which some of the 
wretched crawl at the bottom of the social edifice, are not the sepul- 
chre itself; they are its antechamber; but like those rich men who 
display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of their palace, 
death, who is close at hand, seems to display his greatest wretched- 
ness m this vestibule. 

. The man became silent, the woman did not speak, the girl did not 
seem to breathe. Marius could hear the pen scratching over the paper. 

The man muttered out, without ceasing to write : — ‘^Rabble 1 
rabble ! all is rabble 

This variation upon the ejaculation of Solomon drew a sigh from 
the woman. 

'‘My darling, be calm,” said she. "Do not hurt yourself, dear. You 
are too good to write to all those people, my man.” 

In poverty bodies hug close to each other, as in the cold, but hearts 
grow distant. This woman, according to all appearance, must have 
loved this man with as much love as was in her ; but probably, in the 
repeated mutual reproaches which grew out of the frightful dis- 
tress that weighed upon them all, this love had become extitiguished. 
She now felt towards her husband nothing more than the ashes of 
affection. Still the words of endearment, as often happens, had 
survived. She said to him : Dear; my darling; my man, etc., with her 
lips, her heart was silent. 

The man returned to his writing. 


VII 

STRATEGY AND TACTICS 

Marius, with a heavy heart, was about to get down from the sort 
of observatory which he had extemporised, when a sound attracted 
his attention, and induced him to remain in his place. 

The door of the garret was hastily opened. The eldest daughter 
appeared upon the threshold. On her feet she had coarse men’s shoes, 
covered ‘With mud, which had been spattered as high as her red 
ankles, and she was wrapped in a ragged old gown which Marius had 
not seen upon her an hour before, but which she had probably left at 
his door that she might inspire the more pity,, and which she must 
have put on upon going out. She came in, pushed the door to be-

hind her, stopped to take breath, fur she was (pute breathless, fheti 
cried with an expression of joy and lriuni|)!i : 

“He is coming !” 

The father turned his eyes, the wointin turned her head, the 
younger sister did not stir. 

“Who?” asked the father. 

“The gentleman !” . 

“The philanthropist ?” 

"Yes.” 

“Of the clmrch of Saint Jac&lt;pies?" 

“Yes.” 

“That old man ?” 

“Yes.” 

“He is going to Clime?” 

“He is behind me.” 

“You are sure ?” 

“I am sure.” 

“There, true, he is coming?" 

“He is coming in a li:icre." 

“In a fiacre. It is Rothschild?” 

The hither arose. 

“How are yon sure? if he is coming in a fi.ncre, how is it that you 
get here liefore him? you gave him tlie address, at least? you told 
him the last door at the end of the hall on ilie riglit ? provided he 
does not make a mistake ? yon found him at the church tlien ? did he 
rc.ad my letter? what did he .say to you ?” 

“Tut, tut, tut!” said the girl, ‘‘how you run on, goodinan! I’ll 
tell yon; I went into the clmrch, he was at his usual place, [ made 
a curtsey to him, :md 1 gave him die letter, he read it .and said to 
me: Wliere do yon live, my child ? I said : .Monsieur, I will show you. 
He sttid to me: .\o, give me your addres&gt;; my dmigliter has .some 
purcha.ses to make, 1 am going to take a earri.ige and I will get to 
your house as soon as you tin, 1 gave him die addnss. When I told 
him the house, he appeared surpri'»ei1 and lie atated an instant, then 
he said : It is all the sfime, I will go, \\‘heii mass w.as over, 1 saw him 
leave the chureh with his tlanghter. 1 s;iw tiiem gel into a tiacre. And 
I told him plainly the last tioor ;it the end of die liali on tlm right." 

“And lunv do yott know that he will come'" 

“I just saw the fi.'iere coming iitloilie Rue tin I'eui IhtutjHier. That 
is what made me run,’' 

“How dti you know it is the same fiacre?" 

"Bee.'inse I had noticed the. miinlwr,'' 

“What is tile mmilter?" 

“Four hundred and forty.” 

“Good, you are a clever girl." 



MARIUS 633 

The girl looked resolutely at her father, and showing the shoes 
.which she had on, said : 

clever girl, that may be, but I tell you that I shall never put 
on these shoes again, and that I will not do it,- for health first, and 
then for decency’s sake. I know nothing more provoking than soles 
that squeak and. go ghee, ghee, ghee, all along the street. I would 
rather go barefoot.” 

'‘Yon are right,” answered the father, in a mild tone which 
contrasted with the rudeness of the young girl, “but they would 
not let you go into the churches ; the poor must have shoes. People 
do not go to God’s house barefooted,” added he bitterly. Then re- 
turning to the subject which occupied his thoughts — 

“And you are sure, then, sure that he is coming?” 

“He is at my heels, said she. 

The man sprang up. There was a sort of illumination on his face. 

“Wife !” cried he, “you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Put out 
the fire.” 

*The astounded woman did not stir. 

The father, with the agility of a mountebank, caught a broken pot 
which stood on the mantel, and threw some water upon the embers. 

Then turning to his elder daughter : 

“You ! unbottom the chair !” 

His daughter did not understand him at all. 

He seized the chair, and with a kick he ruined the seat. His leg 
went through it. 

As he drew out his leg, he asked his daughter : 

“Is it cold?” 

“Very cold. It snows.” 

The father turned towards the younger girl, who was on the pallet 
near the window, and cried in a thundering voice : 

“Quick! off the bed, good-for^-nothing I will you never do any- 
thing? break a pane of glass!” 

The little girl sprang off the bed trembling. 

“Break a pane of glass !” said he again. 

The child was speechless. 

“Do you hear me ?” repeated the father, “I tell you to break a 
pane !” 

The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose upon tiptoe and 
struck her fist into a pane. The glass broke and fell with a crash, 

“Good,” said the father. 

He was serious, yet rapid. His eye ran hastily over all the nooks 
and corners of the jgarret. 

You would have said Jie was a general, making his final prepara- 
tions at the moment when the battle was about to begin. 

The mother, who had not yet said a word, got up and asked in a 
slow, muffled tone, her words seeming to come out as if curdled: 



634 LES MISKKABLES 

*^Dear, what is it you want to do ?” 

"'Get into bed/’ answered the man. ^ 

His tone admitted of no delibemf ion. TIh^ niollicr ol&gt;eyed and 
threw herself heavily upon one of tlie jxillels. 

Meanwhile a sob was heard in a corner. 

"What is that?” cried the fallier. 

The younger daugliter, withtaii ctjniing out of the darkness into 
which she had shrunk, showed her hk/eding list. In breaking the 
glass she had cut herself ; she liad gone to her mother’s bed, aiKl she 
was weeping in silence. 

It was tlie mother’s turn to rise and cry out. 

"You see now! what stupid things yon are doing? l)reaking your 
glass, she has cut herself !” 

"So much the better!” said the man, "I knew sh&lt;‘ would.” 

"How! so much the better?” resumed the woman. 

"Silence !” replied tlie father. "1 .suppre;.s tin* liherty of the press.” 

Then tearing the chemise which lie had on, he niadt* a bandage 
with which he hastily wrapped tip tlu‘ little girl’s l&gt;leeding wrist. 

That done, his &lt;‘ye fell ui&gt;on llu‘ torn chemise with satisfaction. 

"And the chemise too,” said he, "all tliis has a good ai»iiearance,” 

An icy wind vvdiistled at the window and came into tlu‘ lasom. The 
mist from witliont entered and spread alumt like a whitish wadding 
picked apart hy invisible llniters. I1ir&lt;mt»h tlH‘ broken pane the fall- 
ing snow was setm. 'Hte a »hi promised the day before by tlie Candle-

The father cast a glance ahout liim as if io assure himself tliat he 
had forgotten nothing. Me took an obi shovel atid siu'cad aslies over 
the moistened emliers in such a way as to Iddi* them ctaiipletely. 

Then rising and standing witli his liack tot !u‘ chimmw :

The mother cried impeluously : 

‘Abm always have everything lietti^r than the rest, even pain/* 
"Down r* saiil tlie man. 

The mollier, after a pecnlmr look from tht* imn, hebl her peace. 
There was a moment of silence in the den. The eldest daughter 
was scraping tlu‘ mud tdT the liottom of her dress with a careless air, 
the young sister continued to sob ; the mother had taken hei head

in both hands and was covering her with kisses, saying to her in a 
low tone : 

“My treasure, I beg of you, it will be nothing, do not cry, you will 
make your father angry/^ 

“No cried the father, “on the contrary ! sob ! sob ! that does 
finely/' • 

Then turning to the eldest : 

“Ah ! but he does not come ! if he was not coming, I shall have put 
out my fire, knocked the bottom out of my chair, torn my chemise, 
and broken my window for nothing/' 

“And cut the little girl !” murmured the mother. 

“Do you know," resumed the father, “that it is as cold as a dog 
in this devilish garret ? If this man should not come ! Oh ! that is it 1 
he makes us wait for him ! he says : Well ! they will wait for me ! 
that is what they are for ! — Oh ! how I hate them, and how I would 
strangle them with joy and rejoicing, enthusiasm and satisfaction, 
these rich men ! all the rich ! these professed charitable men, who 
make their plums, who go to mass, who follow the priesthood, 
preachy, preachy, who give in to the cowls, and who think themselves 
above us, and who come to humiliate us, and to bring us clothes ! as 
they call them ! rags which are not worth four sous, and bread ! that 
is not what I want of the rabble ! I want money ! But money, never ! 
because they say that we would go and drink it, and that we are drunk- 
ards and do-nothings ! And what then are they, and what have they 
been in their time ? Thieves ! they would not have got rich without 
that ! Oh ! somebody ought to take society by the four corners of the 
sheet and toss it all into the air ! Everything would be crushed, it is 
likely, but at least nobody would have anything, there would be so 
much gained ! But what now is he doing, your mug of a benevolent 
gentleman ? is he coming ? The brute may have forgotten the address ! 
I will bet that the old fool " 

Just then there was a light rap at the door, the man rushed forward 
and opened it, exclaiming with many low bows and smiles of ado- 
ration : 

“Come in, monsieur ! deign to come in, my noble benefactor, as 
well as your charming young lady," 

A man of mature age and a young girl appeared at the door of the 
garret. 

Marius had not left his place. What he felt at that moment escapes 
human language. 

It was Siie. 

Whoever has loved, knows all the radiant meaning contained in 
the three letters of this word : She. 

It was indeed she. Marius could hardly discern her through the 
luminous vapour which suddenly spread over his eyes. It was that 
sweet absent being, that star which had been his light, for six months, 



636 L E S M I S K R A B L K S 

it was that eye, that brow, that nmuth, that beattt if ul vaiiisIuHl face 
which had prodttccd night when it wiaH, awaw Hu* visivai had been 
in an eclij)sc, it was reapi)earing. 

She a|&gt;j)cared again in this g'hioni, in ibis ganal. in this shapeless 
den, in this horror! 

iMarius shuddered desperately. W’iiat ! it was slie! tin* of 

his heart disturbed his sight. I le frit ready tn melt into ti‘ars. What! 
at last he saw her again after having svntght ft»r her sn Innu ! \[ 
secmexl to him that he had just lost liis staii and tliat he had’^just 
found it again. 

She was still the same, a little paler &lt;in!y ; lua’ delicate face was set 
ina violet velvet hat, her form was hidden tnaler a !»K'u:k satin pelisse, 
below her long dress he caught a glimpse rf lu'r linle feoi s(|!u;emi 
into a silk buskin.

She stepiKal into the room and laid a large |»a&lt;^kat‘e « ai tlie table.

MARIUS 

‘•'Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember.” 

“Dramatic artist, monsieur, and who has had his successes.” 

Here Jondrette evidently thought the moment come to make an 
impression upon the “philanthropist.” He e.xclaimed in a tone of voice 
which belongs to the braggadocio of the juggler at a fair, and, at the 
same time, to the humility of a beggar on the highway: “Pupil of 
Talma! Monsieur 1 1 am a pupil of Talma ! Fortune once smiled on 
me. Alas 1 now it is the turn of misfortune. Look, my benefactor, no 
bread, no fire. My poor darlings have no fire ! My only chair un- 
seated ! A broken window 1 in such weather as is this 1 My spouse -in 
bed 1 sick 1” 

“Poor woman!” said Monsieur Leblanc. 

“My child injured!” added Jondrette. _ 

The child, whose attention had been diverted by the arrival of 
the strangers, was staring at “the young lady,” and had ceased her 
sobbing. 

“Why don’t you cry? why don’t you scream?” said Jondrette to 
her in a whisper. 

At the same time he pinched her injured hand. All this with the 
skill of a juggler. 

■ The little one uttered loud cries. 

The adorable young girl whom Marius in his heart called “his 
Ursula” went quickly to her : 

“Poor, dear child !” said she. 

“Look, my beautiful young lady,” pursued Jondrette, “her bleed- 
ing wrist ! It is an accident wliich happened in working at a machine 
by which she earned si-K sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off 
her arm.” 

“Indeed !” said the old gentleman alarmed. 

The little girl, taking this seriously, began to sob again beautifully. 

“Alas, yes, my benefactor !” answered the father. « 

For some moments, Jondrette had been looking at “the philan- 
thropist” in a strange manner. Even while speaking, he seemed to 
scrutinise him closely as if he were trying to recall some reminis- 
cence. Suddenly, taking advantage of a moment when the new- 
comers were anxiously questioning the smaller girl about her muti- 
lated hand, he passed over to his wife who was_ lying in her bed, ap- 
pearing to be overwhelmed and stupid, and said to her quickly and 
in a very low tone: 

“Notice that man !” 

Then turning towards M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamenta- 
tion: . . ' . 

“You see, monsieur ! my whole dress is nothing but a chemise of 
my wife’s ! and that all tom ! in the heart of winter. I cannot go out, 
for lack of a coat. If lhad a sign of a coat, I should go to see Made- 
moiselle Mars, who knows me, and of whom I am a great favourite. 



638 , LES MISJiRABLES 

She is still living in the Rue de la Tour des Dames, is not she ? You 
know, monsieur, we have played together in the provinces. I shared 
her laurels. Celiniene would come to my relief, monsieur! Elmira 
would give alms to Belisarius ! But no, notlxing ! And not a sou in the 
house ! My wife sick, not a sou 1 My daughter dangerously injured, 
not a sou ! My spouse has choking fits. It is her time of life, and then 
the nervous system has something to do with it. She needs aid, and 
my daughter also ! But the doctor ! but the druggist ! how can I pay 
them ! not a penny 1 1 would fall on my knees liefore a penny, mon- 
sieur ! You see how the arts are fallen ! And do yi lu know, my charm- 
ing young lady, and you, my generous patron, do you know, you who 
breathe virtue and goodness, and who perfume that church where 
my daughter, in going to say her prayers, sees you every day ? For 
I bring up my daughters religiously, monsieur. I have not allowed 
them to take to the theatre. Ah ! the rogues 1 that 1 should see them 
tripping! I do not jest! I fortify them with sermons about honour, 
about morals, about virtue 1 Ask them ! They must walk straight. 
They have a father. They are none of those un fortmuites, who begin 
by having no family, and who end by marrying the public. They are 
Mamsclle Nobody, and become Mailame liverj-hody. 'fhank heaven ! 
none of that in the Fabantou family ! I me.an to educate them vir- 
tuously, and that they may be honest, and that they may be genteel, 
and that they may believe in (lod’s sacred name ! Well, monsieur, 
my worthy monsieur, do you know wiiat is going to happen to-mor- 
row ? To-morrow is the 4th of February, the fat.al day, the last delay 
that my landlord will give me; if I do not pay him this evening, to- 
morrow my eldest daughter, myself, my spouse with her fever, my 
child with her wound, we shall all four lie turned out of doors, and 
driven off into the street, upon the boulevard, without shelter, into 
the rain, upon the snow. You see, monsieur, I owe four quarters, a 
year ! that is sixty francs." 

Jondrette lied. Four quarters wtnild have made hut forty francs, 
and he could not have owed for four, .since it w.as not si.x months 
since Marius had paid for two. 

M. Leblanc took five francs from his pocket and threw them on 
the table. 

Jondrette had time to mutter into the ear of Ids elder daughter : 

“The whelp ! what docs he think I am going to do with his five 
francs ? That will not pay for my chair and my window ! I must make 
my expenses !" 

Meantime, M. Leblanc had taken off a large brown overcoat, which 
he wore over his blue surtotit, and hung it over the hack of the chair. 

“Monsieur Fabantou," said he, “1 have only these five francs with 
me ; but I am going to take my daughter home, and I will return this 
evening ; is it not this evening that you have to pay ?” 



MARIUS 639 

Jondrette’s face lighted up with a strange expression. He ans- 
wered quickly : 

“Yes, my noble monsieur. At eight o’clock, I must be at my land- 
lord’s.’; 

“I will be here at six o’clock, and I will bring you the sixty francs.’^ 

“My benefactor !” cried Jondrette, distractedly. 

And he added in an undertone : 

“Take a good look at him, wife !” 

M. Leblanc took the arm of the beautiful young girl, and turned 
towards the door : 

“Till this evening, my friends,” said he. 

“Six o’clock,” said Jondrette. 

“Six o’clock precisely.” 

Just then the overcoat on the chair caught the eye of the elder 
daughter. 

“Monsieur,” said she, “you forget your coat.” 

Jondrette threw a crushing glance at his daughter, accompanied 
by , a terrible shrug of the shoulders. 

M.' Leblanc turned and answered with a smile : 

“I do not forget it, I leave it.” L . 

“O my patron,” said Jondrette, “my noble benefactor, I am melt-- 
ing into tears ! Allow me to conduct you to your carriage.” 

“If you go out,” replied M. Leblanc, “put on. this overcoat. It is 
really very cold.” , 

Jondrette did not make him say it twice. He put on the brown over- 
coat very quickly. 

And they went out all three, Jondrette preceding the two strang- 
ers. 

X 

PRICE OF PUBLIC CABRIOLETS : TWO FRANCS AN HOUR 

Marius had lost nothing of all this scene, and yet in reality he had 
seen nothing of it. His eyes had remained fixed upon the young girl 
his heart had, so to speak, seized upon her and enveloped her en- 
tirely, from her jfirst step into the garret. During the whole time she 
had been there, he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends ma- 
terial perceptions and precipitates the whole soul upon a single point 
He contemplated, not that girl, but that light in a satin pelisse and £ 
velvet hat. Had the star Sirius entered the room he would not have 
been more dazzled. 

While the young girl was opening the bundle, unfolding the 
clothes and the coverlids, questioning the sick mother kindly and the 
little injured girl tenderly,' he watched all her motions, he endeav- 
oured to hear her wofds. He knew her eyes, her forehead, hei 
beauty, her stature, her gait, he did not know the sound of her voice 



640 LES MISiSRABLES 

He thought he had caught a few words of it once at the Luxem- 
bourg, but he was not absolutely sure, lie Wfuild have given ten 
years of his life to hear it, to ])e al»le to carry a little of that music in 
his vsoul. But all was lost in the wretcherl displays and trumpet Idasts 
.of Jondreltc. This added a real angta* to the lransj&gt;nrt of I\Iarius. 
He l)rooded her wdth his eyes, l ie could nut iniagiiu‘ that it really 
was that divine creature which he saw in the uuMst of the misshapen 
beings of this monstrous den. lie seemed to see a hummiugdard 
among toads. 

When he went out, he had hut one thtujght, to follow lu‘r, not to 
give up her track, not to leave her witliotit knowing when* she lived, 
not to l(,)se her again, at least, after liaving so iniraeulously found 
her! He leaped down fnau the hureati and luuk his liat. As lie was 
putting his hand on the holt, and was just g&lt; u'ug &lt; ait , he ndlected and 
stopped. Hie hall was long, the stairs stet'p, Joutin*Ue a gn‘at talker, 
M. Leblanc doubtless hat! not: yet, got imt&gt; his t'arriagt*; if he should 
turn round in the passage, or on the stairs, or on tiie &lt;Ioorstep, and 
perceive him, ‘Marius, in that liouse, he would etnaaiuly lu* alarmed 
and would find means to escape him anew, and it would he all over 
.at once. What was to he (lone ? wail a little ? hut during the dHay the 
carriage might go. Marius was pi‘rplex&lt;*d. ,\t last lie took the risk 
and went out of his room. 

There was nobody in tlie ball. Me ran tin* stairs, Tlunv was no- 
body on the stairs, lie Imrried down, am! reached tin* botilevard in 
timetosceafiacreturntheciirnerof the Kuedit IVtit Banqnier and 
return into the city, 

Marius ruslied in that, directinn. \\1ien }u» reached the corner of 
the boulevard, he saw the fiacre again gn»ing rajudly down the line 
Moulietard j the fiacre was already at a lung distance, tln/re wa.s no 
means of reaching it ; what shoukl he do? nm after it? impossible; 
and tlien froin the carriage tliey wonbi etu'tainly notice a man running 
at full speed in|nirsuitof theiigam! the failier would recognise him. 
Just at this moment, marvellous and unlieard of gtHMl fortune, 
Marius saw a puldie call j;iassing along die iHHilevard,' ianjay. There 
was but one coursi* to take, to get into ihi.s cab, and folbov the fiacre. 
That was sure, eiTectual, and without clanger. 

Marius made a sign to the driver to stom and cried to him : 

** Right away!” 

Marius liad no cravat, lie liail on ins old working coat, some of 
the buHons of whielt were missing, and his shin was torn in one of 
the plaits of the hosorn. 

The (Iriver stopfied, winked, and reaelied his left hand towards 
Marius, nihhing his f(»n*linger gently with his thumb. 

**What ?” sahl Marius. 

**Pay in advance,” said the driver, 

Marius remeinlKfreil that lie had only sous with him. 



641 


MARIUS 

‘"How much ?’’ he asked. ' 

“Forty sous/' 

“I will pay when I get back/' 

The driver made no reply, but to whistle an air from La Palisse 
and whip up his horse. 

Marius saw the cab move away with a bewildered air. For the 
want of twenty-four sous he was losing his joy, his happiness, his 
love ! he was falling back into night ! he had seen, and he was again 
becoming blind. He thought bitterly, and it must indeed be said, 
with deep regret, of the five francs he had given that very morning 
to that miserable girl. Had he had those five francs he would have 
been saved, he would have been born again, he would have come out 
of limbo pid darkness, he would have come out of his isolation, his 
spleen, his bereavement ; he would have, again knotted lire black 
thread of his destiny with that beautiful golden thread which had 
just floated before his eyes and broken ofif once more. He returned to 
the old tenement in despair. 

He might have thought that M. Leblanc had promised to return 
in the evening, and that he had only to take better care to follow him 
then ; but in his wrapt contemplation he had hardly understood it. 

Just as he went up the stairs, he noticed on the other side of the 
boulevard, beside the deserted wall of the Rue dt la Barriere des 
Gobelins, Jondrette in the “philanthropist's" overcoat, talking to one 
of those men of dangerous appearance, who, by common consent^ are 
called prowlers of the barrieres^ men of equivocal faces, suspicious 
speech, who have an appearance of evil intentions, and who usually 
sleep by day, which leads us to suppose that they work by night. 

These two men C|uietly talking while the snow was whirling about 
them in its fall made a picture which a policeman certainly would 
have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed. 

Nevertheless, however mournful was the subject of his reflections, 
he could not help saying to himself that this prowler of the barri^res 
with whom Jondrette was talking, reserribled a certain Panchaud, 
alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had -once 
pointed out to him, and who passed in the quartier for a very dan- 
gerous night- wanderer. We have seen this man's name in the preced- 
ing book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured . 
afterwards in several criminal trials, and has since become a cele- 
brated scoundrel He was still at that time only a notorious scoundrel. 
He is now a matter of tradition among bandits and assassins. He was 
the head of a school near the close of thejast reign. And in the eve- 
ning, at nightfall, at the hour when crowds gather and speak low, he 
was talked about at the La Force in La Fosse aux Lions. You might 
even in that prison, just at the spot where that privy sewer, which 
served for the astonishing escape of thirty prisoners in broad day in 
1843, passes under the encircling passage-way ; you might, above the 



642 L E S j\t I S K R A n L E S 

flagging of that sewer, read his name, 1 ‘ancii Ai;i»,aiKlac‘iou.sIy cut b 3 ; 
himseli 'upon the outer wall in one of his alt(*rn[)ts to escape. In 
1832, the police already had him under their eye, ])ut lie had not yet 
really made his debut.

OFFERS OF SERVICE KY MISERY TO CRIEK 

Marius mbunted the stairs of the (dd teneinent with slow stej)s ; just 
as he was 'going into his cell, he preceived in t he liall iiehirul liini the 
elder Jondrette girl, wIk^ was folhiwing liiiu. 'hhis girl was odious to 
his sight; it was she who lunl his hve francs, it was too late to ask 
her for them, the cal) was tliere no longm', the fiacre was far away. 
Moreover she would not give them hack it) him, As \i\ questioning 
her about the address of the peoph* who had just ciiiut', tliat was use- 
less; it was plain that she did not kn»»w, since tlu‘ hlirr signed Ihi- 
bantoii was addressed io the hencfiiU'itl f/t'/z/Zcnaoi «)/ (he Church 
Saint Jacques du 1 1 ant Pas, 

Marius went into his room and pusht‘d to Ins dnor liehind liim. 

It did not close ; he turned and .saw a liand holding the door i)artly 
open. 

‘■‘Wliat is it ?” lie askecl ; is tlien* ?" 

It was the Jondrette girl. 

*Ms it you ?” said Marius almost harslily, "‘yt n\ again ? Wdiat do you 
want of me?’’ 

She seemed thoughlful and ditl not lot»k at him. She had lost the 
assurance which she had had in thi‘ mnrning. Slie did not come in, 
but stot)ped in the dusky hall, where Marius ]n‘eceiveil lier through 
the haIf-oiH*n &lt;loor. 

'Xnnrie now, will you answer?’’ said Marins, ‘*\\’hat is it you 
want of me?” 

She raised her mournful eyes, in \vhirh a sort of confused light 
seemed to shine dimly, and sahl to him: 

**?donsieur Marius, vou look sail. Wliat is the matter with von?” 
'AVithme?” 

^‘ Yes, you.” 

**Yhere is nothing the matter with me,” 

**yes!” 

”No.” 

*M: tell you there is!” 

'ddet ine he &lt;|uiet !” 

Marius pushed the door anew, she st ill lield it liaek, 

”Stop/* said she, **vou are wrong, dhonglt you may not: be rich,

done for that ? Can I serve you in anything ? Let me. I do not ask your 
secrets, you need not tell them to me, but yet I may be useful. I can 
certainly help you, since I help my father. When it is necessaiy to 
carry letters, go into houses, inquire from door to door, find out an 
address, follow somebody, I do it. Now, you can certainly tell me. 
what is the matter with you. I will go and speak to the persons; 
sometimes for somebody to speak to the persons is enough to under- 
stand things, and it is all arranged. Make use of me.” 

An idea came into Marius’ mind. What straw do we despise when 
we feel that we are sinking. 

He approached the girl. 

Listen,” said he to her, kindly. 

She interrupted him with a flash of joy in her eyes. 

“Oh ! yes, talk softly to me ! I like that better.” 

“Well,” resumed he, “you brought this old gentleman here with 
his daughter.” 

“Yes.” 

“Do you know their address ?” 

“No.” 

“Find it for me.” 

The girl’s eyes, which had been gloomy, had become joyful ; they 
now became dark. 

“Is that what you want ?” she asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Do you know them ?” 

“No.” ... 

“That is to say,” said she hastily, “you do not know her, but you . 
want to know her.” 

This which had be^come her had an indescribable significance 
and bitterness. 

“Well, can you do it?” said Marius. 

“You shall have the beautiful young lady’s address^” • 

There was again, in these words “the beautiful youiig lady,” an 
expression which made Marius uneasy. He continued : 

“Well, no matter! the address of the father and daughter. Tb 
address, yes !” 

She looked steadily at him. 

“What will you give me ?” 

“Anything you wish !” 

“Anything I wish?” 

“Yes.” 

“You shall have the address.” 

She looked down, and then with a hasty movemeni 

Marius was alone. 

He dropped into a chair, with his head and both el 
swallowed up in thoughts which he could not grasp, ;

"‘You go out ! It is queer that it did not strike your eye/' 

They got up to obey. 

The mother stammered out : 

“With her sore hand ?” 

“The air will do her good,” said Jondrette. “Go along.” 

It was clear that this man was one of those to whom there is no 
reply. The two girls went out. 

Just as they were passing the door, the father caught the elder by 
the arm, and said with a peculiar tone : 

“You will be here at five o'clock precisely. Both of. you. I shall need 
you.” 

Marius redoubled his attention. 

Alone with his wife, Jondrette began to wait the room again, and 
took two or three turns in silence. Then he spent a few minutes in 
tucking the bottom of the woman's chemise which he wore into the 
waist of his trousers. 

Suddenly he turned towards the woman, folded his arms, and 
exclaimed : 

“And do you want I should tell you one thing ? the young lady 

“Well, what?” said the woman, “the young lady?” 

Marius could doubt no longer, it was indeed of her that they were 
talking. He listened with an intense anxiety. His whole life was con- 
centrated in his ears. 

But Jondrette stooped down, and whispered to his wife. Then he 
straightened tip and finished aloud : 

“It is she!” 

“That girl ?” said the wife. • 

“That girl 1” said the husband. 

No words could express what, there was in the that girl of the 
mother. It was surprise, rage, hatred, anger, mingled and combined 
in a monstrous intonation. TheJew words that had been spoken, 
some name,, doubtless, which her husband had whispered in her ear, 
had been enough to .rouse this huge drowsy woman and to change 
her repulsiveneiss to hideousness. 

“Impossible!” she exclaipied, ‘‘when I thjnk that my daughters 
go barefoot and have not a dress to put on ! What I a satin pelisse, a 
velvet hat, buskins* and all! mpre thap two hundred francs wprth] 
one would think she was a lady I np, you are mistaken ! whjr iP thP 
first place she was horrid, this one is not had ! she is really fipt bad) - 
it cannot be she !” 

“I tell you it is shp. Ypu wiP ^ee.” 

At this absolute affirmation, the wptnan raised her pig red 
blond face and looked at the ceiling with a hideous expression. At 
that moment she appeared to I^arius stiU more terrible than hef 
Ixusband, She was a swine with the look of a tigress.

“What!” she resumed, “this horri!)lc beautiful young lady •who 
looked at my girls with an api)carance of pity, can slie be that be^rcrar 1 
Oh, I would like to stamp her heart out 1” 

She sprang off the bed, and remained a moment standing, her hair 
flying, her nostrils distended, her mouth half tipcn, her fists clenched 
and drawn back. Then she fell back upon the pallet. The man still 
walked back and forth, paying no attention to his female. 

After a few moments of silence, he approached her and stopped 
before' her, with folded arms, as before. 

“And do you want I should tell you one thing ?” 

“What?” she asked. 

He answered in a quick and low voice : 

“My fortune is made.” 

The woman stared at him with tliat look which means: Has the 
man who is talking to me gone crazy ? 

He contimted t 

“Thunder! it is a good long time now that I have been a parish- 
ioner of the die-of-hunger-if7you-h:ive-any-lire-and-die-of-cold-if- 

yoii-have-any-bread pari.sh ! I have liad inisery enough ! my yoke 
and the yoke of other people! I jest no longer, I find it comic no 
longer, enough of puus, goo&lt;l Gotl ! No nn &gt;re farces, Father Eternal ! 
I want food for my hunger, I want drink for my thirst ! to .stuff ! to' 
sleep ! to do nothing ! I want to have my turn, I do ! before I burst 1 
I want to be a bit of a millionaire !” 

He took a turn about the garret and atlded : 

"Like other people.” 

“What do you mean ?” asked the wmnan. 

He shook his head, winked and lifted his voice like a street doctor 
about to make a denionstrution : 

“What do I mean? listen !” 

"Hist!” muttered the W'oman, “not .so loud! if it means business 
nobody must hear.” 

^ “Psliaw ! who i.s there tt) hear? our neighhour? I .saw him go out 
just now. Besi&lt;!es, does he hear, the great stupid ? and then I tell vou 
that I saw him go out.” 

Neverthe!c.ss, by a sort of instinct. Jondrette lowered his voice, 
not enough, however, for his words to escape Rltirius. A favourablt 
circumstance, and one which enabled Maritrs to lo.se nothing of this 
conversation, was that the fallen snow deafened the sound of the 
carriages on the boulevard. 

Marius heard this : 

"Listen attentively. He is cauglit, the Crtvam i it is all right. It is 
already done. Everidhing is arranged. I have .seen the men. He will 
come this evening at six o’clock. To bring big sixty francs* the ras-

iome then at six o’clock! our neighbour is gone to dinner then. 
Mother Bougon is washing dishes in the city. There is nobody in the 
house. Our neighbour never comes back before eleven o’clock. The 
girls will stand watch. You shall help us. He will be his own execir 
tor.” 

‘‘And if he should not be his own executor,” asked the wife. 

Jondrette made a sinister gesture and said : 

“We will execute him.” 

And he burst into a laugh. 

It was the first time that Marius had seen him laugh. This laugh 
was cold and feeble, and made him shudder. , 

Jondrette opened a closet near the chimney, took out an old cap 
and put it on his head after brushing it with his sleeve. 

“Now,” said he, “I am going out. I have still some men to see. 
Some good ones. You will see how it is going to work. I shall be 
back as soon as possible, it is a great hand to play, look out for the 
house.” 

And with his two fists in the two pockets of his trousers, he stood 
a moment in thought, then exclaimed : 

“Do you know that it is very lucky indeed that he did not recog- 
nise me ? If he had been the one to recognise me he would not have 
come back. He would escape us ! It is my beard that saved me! xnj 
romantic beafd ! my pretty little romantic beard !” 

And he began to laugh again. 

He 'went to the window. The snow was still falling, and blotted 
out the grey sky. 

“What villainous weather !” said he. 

Then folding his coat : 

“The skin is too large. It is all the same,” added he, “ he did devil- 
ish well to leave it for me, the old scoundrel ! Without this I should 
not have been able to go out and the whole thing would haye been 
spoiled ! But on what do things hang !” 

And pulling his cap over his eyes, he went out. 

Hardly had he had time to take a few steps in the hall, when tl' 
door opened and his tawny and cunning face again appeared. 

“I forgot,” said he. “You will have a charcoal fire.” 

And he threw into his wife’s apron the five-franc piec^ 
“philanthropist” had left him. 

“A charcoal fire ?” asked the woman. 

“Yes.” 

“How many bushels?” 

“Two good ones.” 

“That will be thirty sous'. With the rest,! will buy something for 
dinner.”: 

“The devil, no-”

“Why ?’’ 

“The jiicce of a hundred sous is n(,)( to be spent.'' 

“Why?’' 

“Becatise I shall have .something to buy.” 

“What?” 

“Something.” 

“Ibiw much will you need ?” 

“Where i.s there a tool .store near hen.' ?” 

“Bue MoulTetard.” 

“Oh ! yes, at the corner of some .street : I se&lt;^ the .shop.” 

“But tell me now how much you will need fur what you have 
to buy ?” 

“Fifty .sous or three francs.” 

“There won’t be much left for tlinner.” 

“Don't bother about eating to-day. There is belter business." 
“That is enough, my jewel.” 

At thi.s word from his wifi*, jondnite eltcsed the door, and Marius 
heard his .steijs recefle along the hall an&lt;l go rajudly down the stairs. 
Just then the clock of Saint Mctkird struck om^.

fATlU&lt; KOSTKK 


Marius, all dreamer as he was. w;ts, jis we have said, of a firm and 
energetic nature. His lialdts of solitary niedilation, while developing 
sympathy and commission in him, had jieriiaiis »liminished his lia- 
bility to become irritated, but left inlact tlic faculty of indignation; 
he had the benevolence of a brahmin and the .severity of a judge ; he 
would have pitied a toad, but he would have crusluul a viper. Now, 
it was into a viper’s hole that he had just been looking ; it was a nest 
of monsters that he had be fore his eyes. 

“I mu.st put my foot on these wretches,” .saitl he. 

None of the enigmas which he hoped to see unriddled were yet 
cleared up ; on the contrary, all had jH-rhaiw become still darker ; he 
knew nothing more of the beautiful child of the Luxembourg or of 
the man whom he called M. Lehlanc, excejrt that Jondrette knew 
them. Across the dark words which had !&gt;een uttered, he saw dis- 
tinctly but one thing, that an amiiuscade was preparing, an ambus- 
cade obscure, but terrible ; that they were both running a great risk, 
she probbaly, her father certainly ; that he must foil the hideous com- 
binations of the Jondrettes and binak the web of these spiders. 

He looked for a moment at the female Jondrette. She had pulled 
an old sheet-iron furnace out of a comer and she was fumbling' 
among +he '}ld iron. 



MARIUS 649 

He got down from the bureau as quietly as he could, taking care 
to make no noise. 

In the midst of his dread at what was in preparation, and the hor- 
ror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he felt a sort of 
joy at the idea that it would perhaps be given to him to render so 
great a service to her whom he loved. 

But what was he to do ? warn the persons threatened ? where should 
he find them ? He did not know their address. They had reappeared 
to his eyes for an instant, then they had again plunged into the bound- 
less depths of Paris. Wait at the door for M. Leblanc at six o’clock 
in the evening, the time when he would arrive, and warn him of the 
plot ? But Jondrette and his men would see him watching, the place 
was solitary, they would be stronger than he, they would find means 
to seize him or get him out of the way, and he whom Marius wished 
to save would be lost. One o’clock had just struck, the ambuscade 
was to be carried out at six. Marius had five hours before him. 

There was but one thing to be done. 

He put on his presentable coat, tied a cravat about his neck, took 
his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he had 
been walking barefooted upon moss. 

Besides the Jondrette woman was still fumbling over her old iron. 

Once out of the house, he went to the Rue du Petit Banquier. 

Pie was about midway of that street near a very low wall which 
he could have stepped over in some places and which bordered a 
broad field, he was walking slowly, absorbed in his thoughts as he 
was, and the snow deafened his steps ; all at once he heard voices 
talking very near him. He turned his head, the street was empty&gt; 
there was nobody in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he heard voices 
distinctly. 

It occurred to him to look over this wall. 

There were in fact two men there with their backs to the wall, 
seated in the snow, and talking in a low tone. 

These two forms were unknown to him, one was a bearded man 
in a blouse, and the other a long-haired man in tatters. The bearded - 
man had on a Greek cap, the other was bare-headed, and there was 
snow in his hair. 

By bending his head over above them, Marius could hear. 

The long-haired one jogged the other with his elbow, and said : 

“With Patron-Minnette, it can’t fail.” 

“Do you think so ?” said the bearded one ; -and the long-haired one 
replied : 

“It will be a fafiot of five hundred balles for each of us, and the 
worst that can happen: five years, six years, ten years at most!” 

The other answered hesitatingly, shivering under his Greek cap : 

“Yes, it is a real thing. We can’t go against such things.”

tell yoit that the affair can't fail/' rq,&gt;]ic‘cl the long-haired 
one. '^Father What^s-his-lmme's marunioltc will be harnessed/' 
Then they began to talk about a nielodrania which they had 
seen the evening before at La Gaite. 

Marius went on his way. 

It seemed to him that the obscure words of these men, so 
strangely hidden behind that wall, and croucliing down in the snow, 
were not perhaps without some connection with Jnndrelte’s terrible 
projects. That must he the dffuir. 

He wen t towards the I'auhotirg Saint M arceau. and asked at the 
first shop in his way where he could luid a connnissarv of jixdice. 
Number 14, Rue de Pontoise, was pointed out to him. 

Marius went thither. 

Passing a baker’s shop, he l)otight a Iwo-sou loaf and ate it, 
foreseeing that he would have diniuna * 

On his way he rendered to Providence its due. lie thought that 
if he had not given his five francs to the Jt&gt;ndrettc girl in the

quently known nothing of tin’s, so that tluTc would have been no 
obstacle to the ambuscade of the jondrtdtes, and M. Leblanc would 
have been lost, and doubtless his daughter with iiinn

IN WHICH A POinCE OKKICKR tUVMS A I.AWYKR TWO FISTICUFFS 

On reaching Number 14, Rue de Pontoise, lie wtmi upstairs and 
asked for tlie commissary of police. - 
^‘The commissary of police is not iu/^ said one of the office 
boys; **but there is an inspector who answers for him. Would you 
like to speak to him? is it urgent?’* 
phrs/; said ]\Iarins. 

Tlie office Ijoy introdtUHMl him into the Ciimntissary’s indvate room, 
A man of tall stature was standing there, Indiind a railing, in front 
of a stove, and holding up with bolli hands the flaps of a luige oven 
coat with ^hree capes. He lunl a square fact*, a tliin and firm mouth, 
very fierce, bushy, greyish whiskers, and an eye that would ttirn 
your pockets inside out. You might have said ftf this eye, not that it 
penetrated, hut that it ransacked. 

This nian’s appearance was n«»t nnicli less ft*rocious or formid- 
able than jondrette’s; it is sometimes no less startling to meet the 
dog than the wolf. 

**What do you wish ?** sai&lt;l ho to Maritis, without adding monsieur. 
**The commissary of police?** 

*TIe IS absent. I answer for him/* 
is a verv secret affair/* 



MARIUS 


651 

^'Speak, then.’’ 

‘'And very urgent.” 

“Then speak quickly.” 

This man, calm and abrupt, was at the same time alarming and 
reassuring. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related his 
adventure. — ^That a person whom he only knew by sight was to be 
drawn into an ambuscade that very evening; that occupying the 
room next the place, he, Marius Pontmercy, attorney, had heard 
the whole plot through the partition; that the scoundrel who had 
contrived the plot was named Jondrette; that he had accomplices, 
probably prowlers of the barrieres, among others a certain Pan- 
chaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille ; that Jondrette’s daught- 
ers would stand watch ; that there was no means of warning the 
threatened man, as not even his name was known ; and finally, that 
all this was to be done at six o’clock that evening, at the most desolate 
spot on the Boulevard de I’Hopital, in the house numbered 50-52. 

At that number the inspector raised his head, and said coolly : 

“It is then in the room at the end of the hall ?” 

“Exactly,” said Marius, and he added, “Do you know that house ?” 

The inspector remained silent a moment, then answered, warm- 
ing the heel of his boot at the door of the stove: 

“It seems so.” 

He continued between his teeth, speaking less to Marius than to 
his cravat. 

“There ought to be a dash of .Patron-Minette in this.” 

That word struck Marius. 

“Patron-Minette,” said he. “Indeed, I heard that word pro- 
nounced.” 

And he relate? to the inspector the dialogue between the long- 
haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall on 
the Rue du Petit Banquier. 

The inspector muttered : 

“The long-haired one must be Brujon, and the bearded one must 
be Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards.” 

He had dropped his eyes again, and was considering. 

“As to the Father What’s-his-name, I have a suspicion of who he 
is. There, I have burnt my coat. They always make too much fire 
in these cursed stoves. Number 50-52. Old Gorbeau property.” ' 

Then he looked at Mariqs: 

“You have seen only this bearded man and this long-haired man ?” 

“And Panchaud/’ i 

“You did not see a sort of little devilish rat prowling about there ?” 

“No.” . ; 

“Nor a great, big, clumsy heap, like the ^k^hant in ; the Jnrdin 
, ies Plantes 

,“No.”',.' 



652 LES MISERABLES 

“Nor a villain who has the appearance of an old red cue?'’ 

“No/^ 

“As to the fourth nobody sees him, not even his helpers, clerks 
and agents. It is not very surprising that you did not see him.” ' 

“N 0 , What are all these beings ?" inquired Marius. 

The inspector answered : 

“And then it is not their hour.” 

He relapsed into silence, then resumed : 

, “No. 50-52. I know the shanty. Impossible to hide ourselves 
in the interior without the artists perceiving us, then they would 
leave and break up the play. They are so modest ! the public an- 
noys them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing, 
and make them dance.” ^ 

This monologue finished, he turned towards Marius and asked him 
looking steadily at him : . ' 

“Will you be afraid?” 

“Of what?” said Marius. 

“Of these men?” 

“No more than you!” replied Marius rudely, who began to 
notice that this police spy had not yet called him monsieur. 

The inspector looked at Marius still more steadily and con- 
tinued with a sententious solemnity: 

“You speak now like a brave man and an honest man. Courage 
does not fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.” 

Marius interrupted him : 

“That is well enough ; but what arc you going to do ?” 

The inspector merely answered : 

“The lodgers in that house have latch-keys to get in with at night 
You must have one ? 

“Yes,” said Marius, 

“Have you it with you?” 

“Yes.'; 

“Give it to me,” said the inspector. 

Marius took his key from his waistcoat, handed it to the inspector, 
and added : 

“If you trust me you will come in force;” 

The inspector threw a glance upon I\Iarins such as Voltaire would 
have thrown upon a provincial academician who had proposed a 
rhyme to him ; with a .single movement lie plunged both his hands, 
which were enormous, into the two immense pockets of his over- 
coat, and took out two small steel jiistols, of the kind called fisticuffs. 
He presented them to Marius, saying hastily and al)rnptly, 

“Take these. Go back home. Hide yourself in yotir room ; let them 
think you have gone out. They are loaded. Each with two balls. You 
will watch ; there is a hole in the wall, as you have told me. The men 
will come. Let them go on a little. When you deem the affair at a 



MARIUS 653 

point, ^nd when it is time to stop it, you will fire off a pistol. Not too 
soon. The rest is my affair. A pistol shot in the air, into the ceiling, 
no niatter where. Above all, not too soon. Wait till the consumma- 
tion is commenced ; you are a lawyer, you know what that is.” , 

Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat. 

“They make a bunch that way, they show,” said the inspector. 
“Put them in your fobs rather.” 

Marius hid the pistols in his fobs. 

“Now,” pursued the inspector, “there is not a minute to be lost 
by anybody. What time is it ? Half past two. It is at seven ?” 

“Six o’clock,” said Marius. 

“I have time enough,” continued the inspector, "but I have only 
enough. Forget nothing of what I have told you. Bang. A pistol 
shot.” 

“Be assured,” answered JMarius. ' 

And as Marius placed his hand on the latch of the door to go out, 
the inspector called to him : 

“By the way, if you need me between now and then, come or 
send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert.”

JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASE 

A PEW moments afterwards, towards three o’clock, Courfeyrai’ 
happened to pass along the Rue Mouffetard in company with BoS' 
suet. The snow was falling still faster, and filled the air. Bossuel 
was just saying to Courf eyrac : 

“To see all these snowflakes falling, one would say that thert 
is a swarm of white butterflies in the s!fy.” All at once Bossnet per- 
cejved Marius, who was going .up the street towards the barriers 
with a very peculiar appearance. 

“Hold on, Marius,” said Bossuet. 

“I saw him,” said Courf eyrac. “Don’t speak to him.” 

/my?” 

"He is busy.” 

"At what?” 

“Don’t you see how he looks?” 

“mat look?’’ _ . 

“He has the appearance of a man who is if ollowing somebody.’’ 

“That is true,” said Bossuet. 

“And. see what eyes he is .makh^ !” added tCourfeyEac. 

“Bfit who the devil is he -.following ?” 

“Someideary-sweety-floweiy-bonnet lihe is in love.” 

“But,” observed ’Bossuet, “I do not see any •deaiy, ,nor any 
•sweety, nor any flowery bonnet in-theiStteet. .There is 'no woman.” 



654 LESMISliRABLES 

Courfcyrac looked and exclaimed : 

“Pie is following a man !” 

In fact a man, with a cap on his head, and whose grey beard they 
distinguished although only his liark could he seen, was walking 
some twenty paces in advance ot ISlarius. 

This man was dressed in a new (n’crcnat, which was too large for 
him, and a horrid pair of pantaloons in tatters and black with mud. 

Bossuet hurst out laughing, 

“Who is that man ?” 

“He?” replied Courfeyrac, “Im is a imet. Poets are fond of 
wearing the trousers of a rabbit-skin jiedlar. and the coat of a peer of 
France.” 

“Let us see where Marius is going,” said Bossuet, “let us see 
where this man is going, let tis follow them, eh ?” 

“Bossuet!” exclaimed tlmirfeyrac, “hkigh! of Meaux! you are 
a prodigious fool. Follow a man who is following a man !’’* 

They went on their w.iy. 

Marius had in f.act seen Joixlrettc pa^.sing .aloiig the Rue Mouf- 
fetard and was watching him. 

Jondrette went straight on without susiieetiiig that there was 
nw an tye fixed upon him. 

lie left the Rue MoulTelard, an&lt;i Marius saw him go into one of 
the most wretched plaees on the l\’ue (Iraciense; he stayed there 
about a quarter of an hour, and then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. 
He stopped at a hardware store, which tliere was in those times at 
the corner of the Rue Pierre Lomhard, and, a few minutes after- 
wards, Marius saw him come out of llu&gt; shop, liolding in his hand a 
large cold chisel with a white wooden handle wliicli be concealed 
tinder hi.s coat. At the up|KT end of tlie Rue de Petit Gentilly, he 
turned to the left and walked rapidly to the Rtie du Petit Banquier. 
Night was falling; tlie snow whieh had eeased to fall for a moment 
was beginning again; Marius iiid just at the corner of the Rue du 
Petit Banquier, which was .solitary, as usual, and did not follow 
Jondrette further. It wtis fortunate tiuit lie tlid, for, on reaching 
the low wall where Marius had htiard the long-haired man and the 
bearded man talking, Jondrette turned tiromul, made sure that no- 
body was following him or saw hiin, tlien stepped over tlie wall, 
and disappeared. 

The grounds which this wall hounded coinmunicafed with the 
rear court of an old livery stahle-kceiwr of had repute, who had 
failed, but who had still a few ohi vehicles iintler his sheds. 

Marius thought it be.st to take advantage of jondrette's absence 
to get home ; be.sidc.s k was getting !ate ; every evening, Ma’am Bur- 
gon, on going out to wasli her di.shes in the city, was in the habit 
of closing the home door, whieh was always locked at dusk ; Marius 



MARIUS 655 

had given his key to the inspector of police ; it was important, there- 
fore, that he should make haste. 

Evening had come ; night had almost closed in ; there was now 
but one spot in the horizon or in the whole sky which was lighted 
by the sun ; that was the moon. 

She was rising red behind the low dome of La Salpetriere. 

Marius returned to No. 50-52 with rapid strides. The door was 
still open, when he arrived. He ascended the stairs on tiptoe, and 
glided along the wall of the hall as far as his room. This hall, it will 
be remembered, was lined on both sides by garrets, which were all 
at that time empty and to let. Ma’am Burgon usually left the doors 
open. As he passed by one of these doors , Marius thought he per- 
ceived in the unoccupied cell four motionless heads, which were 
made dimly visible by a remnant of daylight falling through the 
little window. Marius, ndt wishing to be seen, did not endeavour 
to see. He succeeded in getting into his room without, being per- 
ceived and without any noise. It was time. A moment aftei’wards, he 
heard Ma’am Burgon going out and closing the door of the house. 


XVI 

IN' WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE SONG TO AN ENGLISH 
AIR IN FASHION IN 1832 

Marius sat down on his bed. It might have been- half-past five 
o’clock. A half-hour only separated him from what was to come. He 
heard his arteries beat as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark. 
He thought of this double march that was going on that moment 
in the darkness, crime advancing on the one hand, justice coming on 
the other. He was not afraid; but he could not think without a sort 
of shudder of the things which were so soon to take place. To him, 
as to all those whom some surprising adventure has suddenly be- 
fallen, this whole day seemed but a dream ; and, to assure himself 
that he was not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the chill of 
the two steel pistols in his fob-pockets. 

It was not now snowing ; the moon, growing brighter and brighter, 
was getting clear of the haze, and its light, mingled with the white 
reflection from the fallen snow, gave the room a twilight appear- 
ance. • 

There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in 
the partition shine with a.red gleam which appeared to him bloody. 

He was sure that this gleam could hardly be produced by a candle, 
However, there was no movement in their room, nobody was stir^ 
ring there, nobody spoke, not a breath, the stillness was icy and 
deep, and save for that light he could have believed that he was be- 
side a sepulchre.

Marius took his boots off softly, and pushed them under his bed 

_ Some minutes passed. Marius lieard the lower door turn on its 
hinges ;_a heavy and rapid step ascended the stairs and ])assed alotw 

the corridor, the latch of the garret was noisily- lifted ; londrettecamt 
in. - . . lut 

■ Several voices were heard immediately. The whole family was in 
the garret. Only they kept silence in the'abseiice of the master like 
the cubs in the absence of the wolf. ’ 

“It is me,” said he. 

“Good evening, penmuche,” squeaked the daughters. 

“Well !” said the motlier. 

“All goes to a charm,” answered Jondrttte, ‘‘but my feet are 
as cold as a_ dog’s. Good, that is right, 3 'ou are tiressed tip. You must 
be able to inspire confidence.” 

“All ready to go out,” 

“You will forget nothing of wh;it I told von ! von will do the 
whole of it?” 

“Rest assured about that.” 

“Because — ” said jondrette. .-Xml lie did not finish his sentence. 

Marius heard him put something hcavv on the talile. nrobahlv 
the^ chisel which he had bonghl. * / 

“Ah, hal” sai&lt;I Jtindrelte, "havt‘ you been ettiing here?” 

‘ \’cs, said the nuither, “I have bad three lug potatoes and .some 
salt. I took advantage of t!ie fire to cook them,'' 

“Well,” replied^ jondrette, “to-mornnv I will take you to dine 
with me. There will be a duck and tlie aecompaniiiients. You shall 
dine like Qtarles X. ; everything is going well ?” 

Then he added, lowering his voiee; 

“The mouse-trap is ojien. The cats are reaily." 

He lowered his voice still more, fiml s;iid : 

‘‘.Put that into the fire.” 

Marius heanl a sound of ('h;irco;iI, .as if soniehodt’ was striking 
it with pincers or some iron tool, aiul jondrette continued : 

‘TIaveyou greased the hinges of ihe door, so tliat they shall not 
make any noise?" 

“Yes,” answered the mother, 

“What time is it ?" 

“Si,K o’clock, almost, 1’he half has just struck on .Saint Medard." 

“'I’he tlevil 1 " saiil Jondrette, "the girls must go and stand watch. 
Come here, you children, aiul listen to me.” 

There was a whisjiering. 

Jondrelte’s voice rost* again : 

“Has Burgon gone out ?" 

“Yes,” said the mother. 

“Are you sure tlu-re is nolimly at home in our neighliour's room ?” 



MARIUS 657 

has not been back to-day, and you know that it is his dinner 

time/' 

‘‘You are sure?" 

“Sure." 

“It is all the same," replied Jondrette; “there is no harm in going 
to see whether he is at home. Daughter, take the candle and go." 

Marius dropped on his hands and knees, and crept noiselessly 
under the bed. 

Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light 
through the cracks of his door. 

“P'pa," cried a voice, “he has gone out." 

He recognised the voice of the elder girl. , 

“Have you gone in ?" asked the father. 

“No," answered the girl, “but as his key is in the door, he has 
gone out," 

The father cried : 

“Go in just the same." 

The door opened, and Marius saw the tall girl come in with a 
candle. She had the same appearance as in the morning, except that 
she was still more horrible in this light. 

She walked straight towards the bed. Marine, had a moment of 
inexpressible anxiety, but there was a mirror nailed on the wall 
near the bed ; it was to that she war going. She stretched up on tiptoe 
and looked at herself in it. A sound of old iron •! ..ttling was heard 
in the next room. 

She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled at 
the mirror, singing the while in her broken sepulchral voice : 

Nos amours out dur6 tout une semaine, 

Mais que clii bonheur Ics instants soiit courts! 

S*adorcr huit joui-s, ’^tait bien la peine! 

Le temps dcs amours devrait dwrer toxijours ! 

Devrait durer tou jours! devrait durer tou jours! 

Meanwhile Marius was trembling. It seemed impossible to him 
that she should not hear his breathing. 

She went to the window and looked out, speaking aloud in her 
half-crazy way. 

“How “Ugly Paris is when he puts a white shirt on !" said she, ^ 

She returned to the mirror and renewed her grimaces, taking 
alternately front and the three-quarter views of herself. 

“Well," cried her father, “what are you doing now?" 

,“I am looking under the bed and the furniture," answered she, 
continuing to arrange her hair ; “there is nobody here." 

“Booby !" howled the^father, “Here immediately, and let us lose 
no time." 



658 L E S M I S E R A IS I. E S 

“I am coming ! I am coming !” said she. “One has no time for 
anything in their shanty.” 

She hummed ; 

Voiis me qnittez potirallcT a la glnire, 

Mon Iristc ccciir suivra partoiU vis pas. 

She cast a last glance at the mirror, aiul went out, .shuttiii"- tlm 
door after her. _ ® 

A moment afterwards, Marius heard the sound tif the bare feet 
of the two young girls in the passage, and the voice of Jondrette 
cr 5 dng to them. 

“Pay attention, now! one towards the harriere, ilie other at the 
corner of the Rue du Petit Bancjuier. Don’t lose sight of the hrm.se 
door a minute, and if 3 mn sec the le.ast thing, here iinmediatelvl 
tumble along ! You have a key to come in witi.,” ^ 

The elder daughter nnitt('rcd : 

“To stand sentry barefoot in the sin nv !" 

“To-morrow you shall have hoots of lu-eile colour silk !” .said the 
father. 

They went down the stairs, and. a f&lt;'W sironds .afterwards, the 
sound of the lower door shutting .ainioniu ed th.af they had .gone'out 

There were now in the house only .Marius .and the fondretles and 
probably also the mysterious beings of wlmin Mar’ius had ean'"ht 
a glimpse in the twilight behind the &lt;Ioor of the imlenanttal garrctT

Mautits judged that the time lia-1 »'ome to reMsme his place at his 
/ih.scrvatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age he was 
at the hole in the p.artition. 

T'Tc lookeri in. 

i he intei lor of the Jondrelti* Jipartmi-'iit pn-^enteri a sine'tihir ap- 
pearance, and lilarins found the eNjdanaiion of the stra'ng&lt;&gt; light 
which he had noticed. A candle was hnrning in n verdigrised caiufle- 
stick, hut it wa.s not that which re.allv lighted the room. T'lie entire 
flen wa.s, as it were, illuminated by flu; r.dleetioji of a large .sheet 
iron furnace in the fireplace, wliicli \v;is filled with liidited charcoal 
1 he fire which the female Jondrette h.ad made readv'in the il.avtime' 
■The charcoal was htiniingatid the ftirn.aee was red hot. a hhtc flame 
danced over it and helpetl to .show the form of the chisel bought by 
Jondrette in the Kite Pierre l.otnbarrl, which w.as growing ruddy 
among the cords. In a corner near the door, am! arranged as if for 
antu ipated use, were two hcajss which appeared to he, one a heap 



MARIUS 659 

of old iron, the other a Leap of ropes. All this would have made one; 
who had known nothing of what was going forward, waver between 
a very sinister idea and a very simple idea. The room thus lighted 
up seemed rather a smithy than a mouth of hell; but Jondrette, in 
that glare, had rather the appearance of a demon than of a black- 
smith. 

The heat of the glowing coals was such that the candle upon the 
table melted on the side towards the furnace and was burning fastest 
on that side. An old copper dark lantern, worthy of Diogenes turned 
Cartouche, stood upon the mantel. 

The furnace, which was set into the fireplace, beside the almost 
extinguished embers, sent its smoke into the flue of tfie chimney 
and exhaled no odour. 

The moon, shining through the four panes of the window, threw 
its whiteness into the ruddy and flaming garret; and to Marius^ 
poetic mind, a dreamer even in the moment of action, it was like a 
thought of heaven mingled with the shapeless nightmares of earth. 

A breath of air, coming through the broken square, helped to 
dissipate the charcoal odour and to conceal the furnace. 

The Jondrette lair was, if the reader remembers what we have 
said of the Gorbeau house, admirably chosen for the theatre of a 
deed of darkness and violence, and for the concealment of a crime* 
It was the most retired room of the most isolated house of the most 
solitary boulevard in Paris. If ambuscade had not existed, it would 
have been invented there. 

The whole depth of a house and a multitude of untenanted rooms 
separated this hole from the boulevard, and its only window 
opened upon waste fields inclosed with walls and palisade fences.^ 

Jondrette had lighted his pipe, sat down on the dismantled chair, 
and was smoking. His wife was speaking to him in a low tone. 

If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men 
who laugh at every opportunity in life, he would have burst with 
laughter when his eye fell upon this woman. She had on a black hat 
with plumes somewhat similar to the hats of the heralds-at-arms at 
the consecration of Charles X,, an immense tartan shawl over her 
knit skirt, and the man's shoes which her daughter had disdained 
in the morning. It was this toilet which had drawn from Jondrette 
the exclamation : Good! you are dressed up! you have done well! You 
must be able to inspire confidence! 

As to Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, too large for 
him, which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costume continued to 
offer that contrast between the coat and pantaloons which constituted 
in Courf eyrac's eyes the ideal of a poet. 

Suddenly Jondrette raised his voice ; 

^^By the way, now, I think of it. In such weather as this he will 
come in a fiacre. Light the lantern, t^e it, and go down. You will 



■660 LES MlSfiRABLES 

Stay there behind the lower door. The nionieiit ymi hear the carriage 

stop, you will open immediately, he will come up, y&lt;)u will light him 

up the stairs and above the hall, and when he comes in here, you will 

,go down again immediately, pay the driver, and send the fiacre 

away.” 

“And the money ?” ashed the woman. 

Jondrette fumbled in his trousers, and handed her five francs. 

“What is that?” she c.xclaimed. 

Jondrette answered with dignity ; — 

“It is the monarch which our neighliour gave this morning.” 

And he added : — 

“Do you know ? we must have two chair, s hert*." 

“What for?” 

“To sit in.” 

Marius felt a shiver run down his hack on hearing the woman make 
this quiet reply : — 

“Pardicu ! I will get our ncighhcnir’s.” 

And with rapid movement .she opened the door of the den, and 
went out into the hall. 

Marius jiliysically had not the time to gel down from the bureau, 
and go and hitle liim.self inuliT the bed. 

“Take the candle,” cried Jondrette. 

“No,” said .she, “tliat would Ixiiher me ; 1 have two chairs to bring. 
It is moonlight," 

Marius heard the heavy han«! of niotlier Jondrette groping after 
his key in the dark. The door opened. He .stood nailed to hi's place 
by apprehension and stupor. 

The woman came in. 

The gable witulow let in a ray df moonlight, between two great 
sheets of shadow. One of these .sheets of sii.'ulow entirely covered the 
wall against which Marius was leaning, .so as to conceal him. 

The inother Jondrette raised Ikt eves, did not .see Marins, look the 
two chairs, the oiily chairs wiiich Mariu.s had, and wtait out, slam- 
ming the door noisily behind Iter. 

She went hack iJito tlte den. 

“Here are the two chairs.” 

“And here is the lantern,” said the lui.sliaiid. “Ho «Iown quick.” 

She hastily olieyed, and Jondrette was left alone, 

He arranged the two chairs on the two .sides of the lalile, turned 
the chi.se! over in the fire, put an ok! screen in front of the fireplace, 
which concealed the furnace, then went lo the ci »rtier wht&gt;re the heap 
of rope.s w.a.s, and stooped down, as if to examine .something, MarittS 
then perceived tliat what he had taken for a shapeless ht-ap, was a 
rope ladtler, very well made, with wooden rounds, am! two large 
hooks to hang it !)y. 

Thk ladder and a few big tmds, actual inas.sesof iron, which were 



MARIUS 661 

thrown upon the pile of old iron heaped up behind the door, were not 
in the Jondrette den in the morningj and had evidently been brought 
there in the afternoon, during Marius’ absence. 

“Those are smith’s tools,” thought Marius, _ 

Had Marius been a little better informed in this line, he would 
have recognised, in what he took for smith’s tools, certain instru- 
ments capable of picking a lock or forcing a door, and others capable 
of cutting or hacking, — ^the two families of sinister tools, which 
thieves call cadets and fauchants. 

The fireplace and the table, with the two chairs, were exactly op- 
posite Marius. The furnace Was hidden; the room was now lighted 
only by the candle ; the least thing upon the table or the mantel made 
a great shadow. A broken water-pitcher masked the half of one wall. 
There Was in the room a calm which was inexpressibly hideous and 
thteatening. The approach of some appalling thing could be felt. 

Jondrette had let his pipe go out — a sure sign that he was intensely 
absorbed — and had come back and sat down. The candle made the 
savage ends and comers of his face stand out prominently. There 
were contractions of his bfows, and abrupt openings of his right 
hand, as if he were replying to the last counsels of a dark interior 
monologue. In one of these obscure replies which he was making to 
himself, he drew the table drawer out quickly towards him, took out 
a long carving knife which was hidden there, and tried its edge on his 
nail. This done, he put the knife back into the drawer, and shut it. 

Marius, for his part, grasped the pistol which was in his right fob 
pocket, took it out, and cocked il. 

The pistol in cocking gave a little clear, sharp sound. 

Jondrette starte'd, and half rose from his chair. 

“Who is there ?” cried he. 

Marius held his breath ; Jondrette listened a moment, then began 
to laugh, saying : — _ 

“What a fool I am ? It is the partition cracking.’’ 

Marius kept the pistol in his hand. 

XVIII 

MARIUg’ TWO CHAIRS FACE EACH OTHER 
Just then the distant and melancholy, vibration of a bell shook the 

windows. Six o’clock struck on Saint Medard. _ _ 

Jondrette marked each stroke with a nod of his head. At the sixth 
stroke, he snuffed the candle with his fingers. 

Then he began to walk about the room, listened m the hall, vralked, 
listened again : “Provided he comes 1” muttered he ; then he returned 
to his chair. 

He had hardly sat down when the door opened.

She slijrjied away, while her husbaiHl was lavi-Ling bows and of-

The snow which had been falling ever since nunming, was so deep

THE DISTRACTIONS OF DARK CORNERS 

No sooner was Monsieur Leblanc seated than he turned his eyes 
towards the empty pallets. 

‘‘How does the poor little injured girl do?’^ he inquired. 

“Badly/’ answered Jondrette with a doleful yet grateful smile, 
“very badly, my worthy monsieur. Her eldest sister has taken her to 
the Bourbe to have her arm dressed. You will see them, they will be 
back directly.” 

“Madame Fabantou appears to me much better?” resumed Mon- 
sieur Leblanc, casting his eyes upon the grotesque accoutrement of 
sthe female Jondrette, who, standing between him and the door, as 
if she were already guarding the exit, was looking at him in a 
threatening and almost a defiant posture. 

“She is dying,” said Jondrette. “But you see, monsieur ! she has 
so much courage, that woman ! She is not a woman, she is an ox.” 

The woman, touched by the compliment, retorted with the smirk 
of a flattered monster : 

“You are always too kind to me. Monsieur Jondrette.” 

“Jondrette!” said M. Leblanc, “I thought that your name was 
Fabantou?” 

“Fabantou or Jondrette 1” replied the husband hastily. “Sobriquet 
as an artist 1” . ‘ 

And, directing a shrug of the shoulders towards his wife, which 
M, Leblanc did not see, he continued with an emphatic and caressing 
tone of voice : 

“Ah ! how long we have always got along, together, this poor dear 
and 1 1 What would be left to is, if it were not for that ? We are so 
unfortunate, my respected monsieur ! We have arms, no labour ! We 
have courage, no work 1 1 do not know how the government arranges 
it, but, upon my word of honour, I am no Jacobin, monsieur, I am 
no brawler, I wish them no harm, but if I were the ministers, upon 
my most sacred word, it would go dififerently. Now, for example, I 
wanted to have my girls learn the trade of making card boxes. You 
will say: Whatka trade? Yes! a trade! a simple trade! a living! 
What a fall, my benefactor ! What a degradation, when one has been 
what we were ! Alas ! we have nothing left from our days of pros- 
perity! Nothing but one single thing,, a painting, to which I 
cling, but yet which I shall have to part with, for we must live ! item, 
we must live V* 

While Jondrette was talking, with an apparent disorder which de- 
tracted nothing from the crafty and cunning expression of his 
physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the feack of 
the room somebody whom he had not before seen. A man had come 



664 LES MISfeRABLES 

in so noiselessly that nobody had heard the door turn on its hinges. 
This man had a knit woollen waistcoat of violet colour, old, worn-out' 
stained, cut, and showing gaps at all its folds, fidl trousers of cotton 
velvet, socks on his feet, no shirt, his neck bare, his arms bare and 
tattooed, and his face stained black. Me sat down in silence and with 
folded arms on the nearest bed, ajid as he kept behind the woman 
he was distinguished only with difiicult y. ’ 

That kind of magnetic instinct which warns the eye made M. Le- 
blanc turn. almost at the same time with Marius. ] le could not help a 
movement of surprise, which did not escape Jondrette: 

“Ah! I see!” exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with a 
complacent air, “you are looking at voxir overcoat. It’s a tit I my faith 
it’s a fit!” ' 

“Who is that man ?”said M. Leblanc. 

_ “That man ?” said Jondrette, “that is :i iieighixiur. Pay no atten- 
tion to him.” 

The neighhour had a singular a])pearanee. However, factories of 
chemical products abound in h’auhourg Saint J^harceau. Many ma- 
chinists might have their faces blacked. Hie whole person of M. 
Leblanc, moreover, breathed a candid and intrepid confidence. He 
resumed : 

“Pardon .me ; wh.it were you saying to me, Monsieur Fahantou?” 

“1 was telling you, monsieur and dear patron,” rejilieil Jondrette, 
leaning his elbows on the table, and gazing at .M. Leblanc with fixed 
and tender eyes, similar to the eyes ni a boa constrictor, “I was telling 
you that I had a picture to sell.” , ^ 

A slight noise was made at the tloor. ;V second man entered; and 
sat down on the bed behind the female londretle. Me had his arms 
bare, like the first, and a mask of ink or "of soot. 

Although this man had, literally .slipped into tlie room, he could 
not prevent M. Lelilauc from perceiving him. 

“Do not miml them.” said Jondrette. “Tliey are people of the 
house. I was telling you, then, that I have a vahuible painting left. 
Here, monsieur, look.” 

He got up. went to the wall, at the foot of which stood tin; panel 
of which we have .spoken, atid turned it round, still le.iving it resting 
agam.st tte wall. It wa.s something, in fact, that resenililcd a picture, 
and winch the candle scarcely revi-aled, Marius could make nothing 
out of it, Jondrette being between Ttim and the picture ; he merely 
caught a glimpse of a coarse dauli, with a .stirt of principal personage, 
coloured in the crude* and glaring style of strolling ptinoramas and 
paintings upon screens. 

“What is that ?” asked M. Leblanc. 

^fondrette exclaimed : 

‘A painting by a master : a picture of great price, my benefactor ! 
I cling to It as to my two daughters, it calls up mentor fes to me ! hut 



MARIUS 665 

I have told you, and I cannot unsay it, I am so unfortunate that I 
would part with it.” 

Whether by chance, or whether there was some beginning of dis- 
trust, while examining the picture, M. Leblance glanced towards the 
back of the room. There were now four men there, three seated on 
the bed, one standing near the door-casing ; all four bare-armed, mo- 
tionless, and with blackened faces. One of those who were on the bed 
was leaning against the wall, with his eyes closed, and one would, 
have said he was asleep. This one was old ; his white hair over his 
black face was horrible. The two others appeared young ; one was 
bearded, the other had long hair. None of them had shoes on ; those 
who did not have socks were barefooted. 

Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed upon these men. 

''They are friends. They live near by,” said he. "They are dark 
because they work in charcoal. They are chimney doctors. Do not oc- 
cupy your mind with them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Take 
pity on my misery. I shall not sell it to you at a high price. How much 
do you estimate it worth ?” 

"But,” said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the face and like 
a man who puts himself on his guard, "this is some tavern sign, it is 
worth about three francs.” 

Jondrette answered calmly I 

"Have you your pocket-book here ? I will be satisfied with a thou- 
sand crowns.” 

M. Leblanc rose to his feet, placed his back to the wall, and ran 
his eye rapidly over the room. He had Jondrette at his left on the 
side towards the window, and his wife arid the four men at his right 
on the side towards the door. The four men did not stir, and had not 
even the appearance of seeing him ; Jondrette had begun again to talk 
in a plaintive key, with his eyes so wild and his tones so mournful, 
that M. Leblanc might have thought that he had before his eyes noth- 
ing more nor less than a man gone crazy from misery. 

"If .you do not buy my picture, dear benefactor,” said Jondrette, 
"I am without resources, I have only to throw myself into the river. 
When I think that I wanted to have my two girls learn to work on 
cardboard demi-fine, cardboard work for gift-boxes. Well! they 
must have a table with a board at the bottom so that the glasses 
shall not fall on the ground, they must have a furnace made on pur- 
pose, a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of 
strength which the paste must have according to whether it is used 
for wood, for paper, or for cloth, a knife to cut the pasteboard, a 
gauge to adjust it; a hammer for the stamps, pincers, the devil, how 
do I know what else ? and all this to earn four sous a day I and work 
fourteen hours 1 and every box passes through the girl's hands thir- 
teen times ! and wetting the paper ! and to stain nothing ! and to keep

Jonclrctte did uot look at Lebbuc, who was 
watching him. M. Leblanc’s eye was IixchI upon juncltettc, andjon- 
dreue’s eye upon the door, Marius’ breathless attentum went from 
one to tS other. M. Leblanc appeared to ask hunsdf, is this an

his head, directed in turn towards all the heads which surrounded 
him, moved on his. neck with an attentive and astonished slowness, 
but there was nothing in his manner which resembled fear. He had 
made an extemporised intrenchment of the table ; and this man who, 
the moment before, had the appearance only of a good old man, had 
suddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his powerful fist upon 
the back of his chair with a surprising and formidable gesture. 

This old man, so firm and so brave before so great a peril, seemed 
to be one of those natures who are courageous as they are good, 
simply and naturally. The father of a woman that we love is never a 
stranger j:o us. Marius felt proud of this unknown man. 

Three of the men of whom Jondrette had said : they are chimney 
doctors, had taken from the heap of old iron, one a large pair of 
shears, another a steelyard bar, the third a hammer, and placed them- 
selves before the door without saying a word. The old man was still 
on the bed, and had merely opened his eyes. The woman Jondrette 
was sitting beside him. 

Marius thought that in a few seconds more the time would come to 
interfere, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the di- 
rection of the hall, ready to let off his pistol-shot. 

Jondrette, after his colloquy with the man who had the cudgel, " 
turned again towards M. Leblanc and repeated his question, accom- 
panying it with that low, smothered, and terrible laugh of his : 

^‘You do not recognise ine, then ?'* 

M. Leblanc looked him in the face, and answered : 

Then Jondrette came up to the table. He leaned forward over the 
candle, folding his arms, and pushing his angular and ferocious 
jaws up towards the calm face of M. Leblanc, as nearly as he could 
without forcing him to draw back, and in that posture, like a wild 
beast just about to bite, he cried : 

“My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name 
is Thenardier ! I am the innkeeper of Montfenpeil ! do you under- 
stand me ? Thenardier ! now do you know me ?” 

An imperceptible flush passed .over M. Leblanc V forehead, and he 
answered without a tremor or elevation of voice, and with his usual 
placidness : 

“No more than before.’’ 

Marius did not hear this answer. Could anybody have seen him at 
that moment in that darkness, he would have seen that he was hag- 
gard, astounded, and thunderstruck. When Jondrette had said: My 
name is Thenardier, Marius had trembled, in every limb, and sup- 
ported himself against the wall as if he had felt the chill of a sword- 
blade thx-ough his heart. Then his right arm, which was just ready 
to fire the signahshot, dropped slowly down, and at the moment that 
Jondrette had repeated : Do you understand me, Thinardier? Mar-

ills’ nerveless fingers had almost drupjtctl the pistol, Jnndrctte, in 
unveiling who he was, hud not moved M.^l.ehlane, but he 
completely unnerved Marins. That name of Thenardier, which M. 
Leblanc did not seem to know, Marius knew. J&lt;einember what that 
name was to him ! that name he had worn tm his heart, written in his 
father’s will! he carried it in the innermost jdace of his thoughts, in 
the holiest spot of his memory, in that sacretl command: “A man 
named Thenardier .saved my life. If niy .son slionid meet him, he 
will do him all the good he can." Th;jt name, we remember, wa.s one 
of the devotions of his soul; he mingled it with the name of his 
father in his wor.ship. What! here was 'riienanlier, here wa.s that 
Thenardier, here was tliat innkeeper of Montferineil, f((r wliom he 
had so long and so vainly sought 1 lie had found him at last, and how? 
this saviour of his fallier was a hatidil ! tliis man, tu whom he, M.arius, 
burned to devote himself, wins a monster ! this deliverer of Colonel 
Pontmercy was in the actual commissiiui of a criiiie, tiie shape of 
which Maritts did not yet .see very distinctly. Imt which lookeil like 
an nsfiassination ! and upon whom, t ire.at t iod ! wh;it a fatality 1 what 
a bitter nuK'kcry of Fate! llis fatlu;r from the &lt;lejiths of his coffin 
commanded him to do all the gaud he could to Thcnanlier; for four 
years Marius had had no other thought than t&lt;i aciinit this debt of 
his hither, and the moment that lie was about to cause a lirig.and to 
lx; seized by justice, in the midst of u crime, destiny called to him: 
that is Thenardier 1 ins father’s life, saved in a storm of graix: upon 
the heroic field of Waterloo, he was at last about t«» reward this man 
for, and to reward him with the .scalVold! 1 le hail resolved, if ever 
he found this Then.iri!ier, to accost him in no other wise than by 
throwing him,se!f at his feet, and now he found liim indeed, but to 
deliver him to tlie e.\ecutioner ! his f.illier said to Itiiri : Aid Thenar- 
dierj and he was answering that adored and liolv voice bv crush- 
ing Thenardier! presenling as a spectacle to his father in his tomb, 
the man who Iiad snatched liiiij from death .-it the peril of his life, 
executed in the Place St. J,nc(|ues by the act of his son, this Marius 
to whom he had Iwipjeathed tliis man ! ,\ftd wh;it a mockery to have 
worn so long upon his breast the last wi- lies of his fatlier, written 
by his hand, only to act so frigluitilly contiary to them 1 luit on the 
other hand, to see him nrnlmseade and not prevent it ! to condemn the 
victim and .sfiare tlx; assassin, could he 1«&gt; fiound to any gratitude 
towards .such a wretch? all the ideas which .Marins had itad for the 
last four years were, as it were, pierced through ami through hy this 
unexpei'ii'd blow. He shuddered. Kverything dependeil upon him. 
He held in his hand, they ail uneonseions, tiiose beings who were 
moving there before his eyesjfhe fired the pistol, M. Leblanc was 
saved and 'rheiiardier was lost; if he «!id not, M. Leblanc was 
sacrificed, and, perl»ai&gt;s, Tln'manlier esenped. Tu hurl the one, 
or to let the other full ! remorse tin either hand, Whitt was to he done ? 



MARIUS 669 

which should he choose ? be wanting to his most imperious memories, 
to so many deep resolutions, to his most sacred duty, to that most 
venerated paper ! be wanting to his father’s will, or suffer a crime 
to be accomplished ? He seemed on the one hand to hear ‘"his Ur- 
sula” entreating him for her father, and on the other the 
colonel commending Thenardier to him. He felt that he was mad. 
His knees gave way beneath him ; and he had not even time to de- 
liberate, with such fury was the scene which he had before his eyes 
rushing forward. It was like a whirlwind, which he had thought him- 
self master of, and which was carrying him away. He was on the 
point of fainting. 

Meanwhile Thenardier, we will call him by no other name hence- 
forth, was walking to and fro before the table in a sort of bewilder- 
ment and frenzied triumph. 

He clutched.the candle and put it on the mantel with such a shock 
that the flame was almost extinguished and the tallow was spattered 
upon the wall. 

Then he turned towards M. Leblanc, and with a frightful look, 
spit out this : 

^‘Singed ! smoked ! basted ! spitted !” 

And he began to walk again, in full explosion. 

'TIa !” cried he, 'T have found you again at last, monsieur philan- 
thropist ! monsieur threadbare millionaire ! monsieur giver of dolls ! 
old marrow-bones ! ha ! you do not know me ? no, it was not you who 
came to Montf ermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, the night of Christ- 
mas, 1823 ! it was not you who took away Fantine’s child from my 
house ! the Lark ! it was not you who had a yellow coat ! no ! and a 
package of clothes in your hand just as you came here this morning ! 
say now, wife ! it is his mania it appears, to carry packages of woollen 
stockings into houses! old benevolence, get out! Are you a hosier, 
monsieur millionaire? you give the poor your shop sweepings, holy 
man ! what a charlatan ! Ha ! you do not know me ? Well, I knew you ! 
I knew you immediately as soon as you stuck your nose in here. Ah ! 
you are going to find out at last that it is not all roses to go into 
people’s houses like that, under pretext of their being inns, with 
worn-out clothes, with the appearance of a pauper, to whom any- 
body would have given a sou, to deceive persons, to act the generou'S, 
take their help away, and threaten them in the woods, and that you 
do not get quit of it by bringing back afterward, when people are 
ruined, an overcoat that is too large and two paltry hospital coverlids, 
old beggar, child-stealer !” 

He stopped, and appeared to be talking to himself for a moment. 
One would have said that his fury dropped like the Rhone into sortie 
hole ; then, as if he were finishing aloud something that he had been 
saying to himself, he struck his fist on the table and cried : 

’'‘With his honest look r 



670 LESMISERABLES 

And aposlroplusing M. Leblanc ; 

'‘Zounds ! you made a mock of me once ! ’i'ou are the cause of all 
my misfortunes ! For i'l fteen hundred francs yt m f&gt;ot a girl that I had,

to my.self : BInbber-li[&gt;,s ! ( io on, 1 lt,ave got yon. I lick your paws this 
morning! f will gnaw your lie, art to-night !" 

Thenardier .stopped, lie was out of breath. His little narrow chest 
was blowing like a bladwinith’s bellows. His eye w.as full of the 
base delight of a feeble, mttd, and cowardly animal, wliich can finally 
prostrate thsit of which it litis stood in awe. and insult what it Im 
flattered, the joy of a dwarf putting his heel upon the he.ad of Go- 
liath, the joy of a jaek.al heginning tit letir a sick hull, de,ad enough 
not to be able to tiefend hiniM'lf, alive enough yet to siilTer. 

M. Leblanc did not internipt him hut said when he stopped: 

"I do not know wliat you inetm. ari' mistaken. 1 am a very 
p&lt;Wf man and anything inn a ininioiiaire. 1 »lo not know you ; you

“Ha!" .screamed Tlieiwnlier, "good momitt'bank! You stick to

"Pardtin me, monsieur," answm-d M. I.eh!ane. with a tone of

powerful elTeet, “{ see that you are a bandit," 

Who has not Hotic«*i! it, liateful l«iings have llieir tender poitits; 
monsters are easily annoyed. At this wor&lt;! bandit, the Then.ardiess 
sprang off the bed. Thenanlier .seized his chair as if he were going 
to crush it in his h.i,nd.s : "Don't ymi stir," cried he to his wife, and 
turning towards M. Leblanc : 

"Batulit 1 Yes, I know that yon call us so, you rich people! Yes!

k is true I have failed ; I am in concealment, I have no bread ; I have 
Mot a sou, I am a bandit. Here are three days that I have eaten nothing, 
I am a bandit ! Ah ! you warm your feet ; you have Sacoski pumps, 
you have wadded overcoats like archbishops, you live on the first 
floor in houses with a porter, you eat truffles, you eat forty-franc 
bunches of asparagus in the month of January, and green peas, 
you stuff yourselves, and when you want to know if it is cold you 
look in the newspaper to see at what degree the thermometer of the 
inventor, Chevalier, stands. But we are our own thermometers ! We 
have no need to go to the quai at the corner of the Tour de I’Horloge, 
to see how many degrees below zero it is ; we feel the blood stiffen in 
our veins and the ice reach our hearts, and we say 'There is* no God !’ 
And you come into our caverns, yes, into our caverns, and call us 
bandits. But we will eat you ! but we will devour you, poor little 
things 1 Monsieur Millionaire ! know this : — I have been a man es- 
tablished in business, I have been licensed, I have been an elector, I 
am a citizen, I am ! And you, perhaps, are not one ?'* 

Here Thenardier took a step towards the men who were before 
the door, and added with a shudder : 

"When I think that he dares to come and talk to me, as if I were a 
cobbler I” 

Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh burst of frenzy : 

"And know this, too, monsieur philanthropist ! I am no doubtful 
man. I am not a man whose name nobody knows, and who comes into 
houses to carry off children. I am an old French soldier ; I ought to 
be decorated. I was at Waterloo, I was, and in that battle I saved a 
general, named the Comte de Pontmercy. This picture which you 
see, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles, do you know 
who it represents ? It represents me. David desired to immortalise- 
that feat of arms, I have General Pontmercy on my back, and I am 
carrying him through the storm of grape. That is history. He has 
never done anything at all for me, this general ; he is no better than 
other people. But, nevertheless, I saved his life at the risk of my 
own, and I have my pockets full of certificates. I am a soldier at 
Waterloo — name of a thousand names ! And now that I have had the 
goodness to tell you all this, let us make an end of it ; I must hpe 
some money ; I must have a good deal of money, I must have an im- 
mense deal of money, or I will exterminate you, by the thunder of 
Godr 

Marius had regained some control over his distress, and was 
listening, The last possibility of doubt had now vanished. It was in- 
deed the Thenardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach 
of ingratitude flung at his father, and which he was on the point of 
justifying so fatally. His perplexities were redoubled. Moreover, 
•there was in all these words of Thenardier, in his tone, in his ges- 
tures, in his look which flashed out flames at every word, there 



•672 LES MISKRABLES 

was in this explosion of an evil nature cxpusing its entire self, in this 
mixture of br!ij;gadocio and alijectness, of pride and pettiness, of 
rage and folly in this chaos of real grievam-es aiul false sentiments, 
HI this shamelessness of a wicked man tasting the sweetness of 
violence, in this brazen nakedness of a deformed soul, in this con- 
flagration of every stiff erin,g combined willi every hatred, something 
which was as hideous as evil and as sharp and bitter as the truth. 

The picture by a master, the painting by I )avid, the purchase of 
which he had proposed tt| Jil. Leltlanc. was. the reader has guessed, 
nothing more than the sign of his chop-house, painted, as will be 
remembered, by himself, the only relic which he had saved from his 
shipwreck at htonfermcil. 

As he had etused to intercept Marins' line of vision, Marius could 
now look at the thing, and in this d;mh he really made out a battle, 
aliackground of smoke, and one man I'arrying nlj another. It was 
the group of 'riienardier and l‘ontinercy_; the saviour sergeant, the 
colonel saved. Marius was as it wr-re intoxicated ; tliis jiictnre in .some 
sort restored his father to life; it was not now the sign of the Mont- 
fernieil inn, it was a resurrection : in it a tomh half opened, from it 
a phantom arose. Marius lieaial his heart ring in his temples, he had 
the cannon of Waterloo soiimling in his ears; his hlt;eding bather 
dimly painted upon this dusky panel startled him. and it seemed to 
him that that slia|»eless sliad*&gt;w was gazing stisidily upon him. 

When Tiiemirdier had taken hreatli he lixiMl his liloodshot eyes 
upon Monsietir Leblanc, and said in .a hnv aiul alirupt tune : 

“What have you to .say before we begiii to dance with yon?" 

Momsieur Lwilanc saiil notljing. In tiu* midst of this silence a 
hoarse voice threw in this gliastly .sarc.asm from the hall: 

“if there is any wood to split, I am on haml !" 

It was the man* with the pole-:ixe wlio was milking merry. 

At the .same time a huge face, brisily and tUrly, appeansl in the 
doorway, with a hideous laugh, whu li sliowtsl not teelli, hut f,angs. 

It was the face of llie mati with the pole axe. 

“Wliat have you taken oil your niiek fur?" cried 'riienardier, 
furiously. 

“To laugh," rcpiietl the man. 

For .some moments, .\h’iii,ji'ur l eblaneh.td seemed to follow and 
to watch ail the movements of 'i luhiardier, who, blinded and be- 
wildered by his own rtige, was walking to and fro in tlie fieri with 
the conlidtince ins}nre»l Ity the feeling thiil the fhtor was guarded, 
having armed jiossessioit of a flisannet! man, and being nine to one, 
even if the 'I'hcnardiess shonld count but I'ftr *irie inipi. In his ajios- 
tnmhe to the niiin with the iiok-axe, he turnefl his Itaek to Monsieur 
Leblanc. 

Monsieur Leblanc seize«l this opijortunily, pushetl the chair away 
with his foot, llie table with his hand, ami at one bound, with a

marvellous agility, before Thenardier had had time to turn around 
he was at the window. To open it, get up and step through it, was the 
work of a second. He was half outside when six strong hands seized 
him, and drew him forcibly back into the room. The three '^chimney 
doctors'' had thrown themselves upon him. At the same time the 
'Ihenardiess had clutched him by the hair. 

At the disturbance which this made, the other bandits ran in from 
e.he hall. The old man, who was on the bed, and who seemed over- 
whelmed with wine, got off the pallet, and came tottering along with 

road-mender's hammer in his hand. 

One of the ‘'chimney doctors,^’ whose blackened face was lighted 
■;.ip by the candle, and in whom Marius, in spite of this colouring,, 
recognised Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, raised a 
sort of loaded club made of a bar of iron with a knob of lead at each 
end, over Monsieur Leblanc’s head. 

Marius could not endure this sight. “Father,” thought he, “par- 
don me !” And his finger sought the trigger of the pistol. The shot 
was just about to be fired, when Thenardier’s voice cried : 

“Do him no harm !” 

This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating 
Thenardier, had calmed him. There were two men in him, the 
ferocious m.an and the crafty man. Up to this moment, in the first 
flush of triumph, before his prey stricken down and motionless, the 
ferocious man had been predominant; when the victim resisted, and 
seemed to desire a struggle, the crafty man reappeared and resumed 
control. 

“Do him no harm !” he repeated, and without suspecting it, the 
first result of this was to stop the pistol which was just ready to go 
off, and paralyse Marius, to whom the urgency seemed to disappear, 
and who, in view of this new phase of aiTairs, saw no impropriety 
in waiting longer. Who knows but some chance may arise which will 
save him from the fearful alternative of letting the father of Ursula 
perish, or destroying the saviour of the colonel ! 

A herculean struggle had commenced. With one blow full in the 
chest M. Leblanc had sent the old man sprawling into the middle of 
the room, then with two back strokes had knocked down two other 
assailants, whom he held one under each knee; the wretches 
screamed under the pressure as if they had been under a granite 
mill-stone; but the four others had seized the formidable old man 
by the arms and the back, and held him down over the two prostrate 
“chimney doctors.” Thus, master of the latter and mastered by the 
former, crushing those below him and suffocating under those above 
him, vainly endeavouring to shake off all the violence and blows 
which we4*e heaped upon him, M. Leblanc disappeared under the 
horrible group of the bandits, like a wild boar under a howling pack 
of hounds and mastiffs.

They succeeded in throwing Jiiin over upuii ilie ]H?d nearest to 
tlie window and held him there in awe. The Thenardiess had not let 
go of his hair. 

“Here,” said 'riienarclier, “let it alone, ^'ou will tear your shawl.” 

The Thenardicss obeyed, a.s tlie she-wnlf obeys her niale, with 'a 
growl. 

“Now, the rest of you,” continue&lt;l 'riienardicr, “search him.” 

M. Leblanc seemed to have given up all resistance. 'I'hey searched 
him. There was nothin,g_uisin him hut a leather purse which con- 
tained si.x francs, and his iitindkerehief, 

Thcnarclier put the handkerchief in his jtoeket. 

“What ! no pocket-honk ?" he .asked. 

“Nor any watch,” answ’ered one of the “chimney doctors.” 

“It is all the same,” nmllered, with the voice of a vi n'i iluijuist, the 
masked man who luid the hi.g key, “he is an old nnt;;h.'' 

Thenardier waait to the corner hy tlie door and ittok a hundle of 
topes which he threw to them. 

“Tie him to the foot of the bed," .said he, and perceiving the old 
fellow who Itiy motionless, when he w;is stretched across tlie room 
by the blow of M. Lebl:uic’.s fist : 

“Is Boiilatnielle dead ?" asked he. 

“No,” answeia-d Bigrciuiille, “he is drunk.” 

“Sweep him into a corner," said 'I'ln'ii.-irilier. 

Two of the “diimuey doctors” pushed llte dnmkani up to the 
heap of old iron with their fet-t. 

“Ballet, what did you bring so manv for?" said 'riieaardier in a 
low tone to the man 'with the cudgel, “it was iieetiless." 

“Wh.at would you iiave?" rcjilied the m.in with the cudgel, “they 
all wanted to be in. The settsoti is btul. There is nothing doing," 

The |&gt;allet upon which M. I.ehlane had lieeii thrown was a .sort 
of hospital bed supported hy four big roughly squareil wooden posts, 
M, Leblanc made no resi.statice. The brij;aiids hound him firmly, 
standing, with his feet to the floor, hy the lte*l-post furthest froln 
the window and neare.st to the clunme'y. 

When the la.st knot was lieil, 'l‘lu*nart!icr took a eluiir ;ind c.-ime 
and sat down nearly in front of M, Lehl.utc, Thenardier looked no 
longer like himself,’ in a few seconds the e.s.i»reNsion of his f.ace luad 
passed from tinhriflled violence to tr:iiii|nil and crafty miklness. 
Marius h.artlly recognised in f}i.at polite, clerkly smile,* tlui .almost 
bea.stly mouth which was foaming .a inoinent k-fore : he looked with 
astoni.shment upon this fant.astic and .alarming metamorphosis, and

itself into an attorney,

And with a gesture dismissing the brigands who still h.ad their 
hands upon M. Leblanc; '

‘^Move off a little,, and let me talk with monsieur/' 

They all retired towards the door. He resumed ; 

"'Monsieur, you were wrong in trying to jump out the window. 
Yon might have broken your leg. Now, if you please, we will talk 
quietly. In the first place I must inform you of a circumstance I 
have noticed, which is that you have not yet made the least outcry/' 

Thehardier was right ; this incident was true, although it had es- 
caped Marius in his anxiety. M. Leblanc had only uttered a few 
words without raising his voice, and, even in his struggle by the 
window with the six bandits, he had preserved the most profound 
and the most remarkable silence. Thenardier continued : 

“Indeed ! youmight have cried thief a little, for I should not have 
found it inconvenient. Murder ! that is said upon occasion, and, as 
far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is 
very natural that one should make a little noise when he finds him- 
self with persons who do not inspire him with as much confidence 
as they might ; you might have done it, and we should not have dis- 
turbed you. We would not even have gagged you. And I will telj 
you why. It is because this room is very deaf. That is all I can say 
for it, but I can say that. It is a cave. We could fire a bomb here, 
and at the nearest guardhouse it would sound like a drunkard's 
snore. Here a cannon would go boom, and thunder would go puff. 
It is a convenient apartment. But, in short, you did not cry out, that 
was'^better, I make you my compliments for it, and I will tell you 
what I conclude from it : my dear monsieur, when a man cries out, 
who is it that comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. 
Well ! you did not cry out ; because you were no more anxious than 
we to see justice and the police come. It is because, — I suspected 
as much long ago, — ^you have some interest in concealing something. 
For our part we have the same interest. Now we can come to an un- 
derstanding." 

While speaking thus, it seemed as though Thenardier, with his 
gaz^ fixed upon Monsieur Leblanc, was endeavouring to thrust 
the daggers which he looked, into the very conscience of his prisoner. 
His language, moreover, marked by a sort of subdued and sullen 
insolence, was reserved and almost select, and in this wretch who/ 
was just before nothing but a brigand, one could now perceive the 
man who studied to be a priest. 

The silence wliich the prisoner had preserved, this precaution 
which he had carried even to the extent of endangering his life, this 
resistance to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter a ciy, all 
this, it must be said, since it^had been remarked^ was annoying to 
Marius, and painfully astonished him.. 

The observation of Thenardier, well founded as it was, added in 
Marius' eyes still more to the obscurity of the mysterious cloud 
that enveloped this strange’ and serious face to which Courfeyrac 



676 LESMIS^RABLES 

had given the nickname of Monsieur Leblanc. But whatever he 
might be, bound with ropes, surrounded by assassins, half buried, 
so to speak, in a grave which was deepening beneath him every 
moment, before the fury as well as before the mildness of Thenar- 
dier, this man remained impassable ; and Marius could not repress 
at such a moment his admiration for that superbly melancholy face. 

Here was evidently a soul inaccessil)le to fear, and ignorant of 
dismay. Here was one of those men who are superior to astonish- 
ment in desperate situations. However extreme the crisis, however 
inevitable the catastrophe, there was nothing there of the agony of 
the drowning man, staring with horrified eyes as he sinks to the 
bottom. 

Thenardier quietly got tip, went to the fireplace, took away the 
screen which he leaned against the nearest |)alk‘t, and thus revealed 
the furnace full of glowing coals in which the prisoner could plainly 
see the chisel at a white heat, spotted here and there with little 
scarlet stars. 

Then Thenardier came hack and sat down hy IMonsieur Leblanc. - 

‘T continue,'’ wSaid he. ‘‘Now we can come to an understanding. 
Let us arrange this amicably. I was wrong to fly into a passion just 
now. I do not know where my wits were, 1 went much too far, I 
talked extravagantly. For instance, because you arc a millionaire, 

I told you that I wanted money, a good deal of moiuy, an immense 
deal of money. That would not be reasonable. My God, rich as' you 
may be, you have your expenses ; who &lt;loes nut have them ? I do not 
want to ruin you. I am not a catch-poll, after all. I am not one of 
those people who, because they have the advantage iti position, use 
it to be ridiculous. Here, I am willing to go lialf way and make some 
sacrifice on ray part. I need only two hundred thousand francs." 

Monsieur Leblanc did not breathe a word. Ilienardier went on : 

“You see that I water my wine pretty wt‘ll, I do not know the state 
of your fortune, but 1 know that you do nt&gt;t care much for money, 
and a benevolent man like you \'an certainly give two hundred 
thousand francs to a father of a family who is unfortunate. Cer- 
tainly you are reasonable also, you do not imagine that I would 
take the trouble I have^ to-day, and tliat I would organise the af- 
fair of this evening, which is a very fine i&gt;iece of work, in the opin- 
ion of these gentlemen, to end o/T by asking you for enough to go and 
drink fifteen sou red wine and cat veal at Desnoyersl Two hundred 
thousand francs, it is worth it* That trifle once out of your pocket, 

I assure you that all is said, and that you need not fear a snap 
of the finger. You will say: but I have not two hundred thousand 
francs with me. Oh ! I am not exacting. I do not require that. I only 
ask, one thing. Have the goodness to write what I shall dictate." 

Here Thenardier paused, then he added, emphasising each word 
and casting a smile towards the furnace : 



MARIUS 677 

‘1 give you notice that I shall not admit that you cannot write/' 

A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile. 

Thenardier pushed the table close up to Monsieur Leblanc, and 
took the inkstand, a pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer, 
which he left partly open, and from which gleamed the long blade 
of the knife. 

He laid the sheet of paper before Monsieur Leblanc. 

. ‘Write," said he. 

The prisoner spoke at last : 

“How do you expect me to write ? I am tied." 

“That is true, pardon me !" said Thenardier, “you are quite right” 

And turning towards Bigrenaille : 

“Untie monsieur’s right arm.” 

Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thenar- 
dier ’s order. When the prisoner’s right hand was free, Thenardier 
dipped the pen into the ink, and presented it to him. 

“Remember, monsieur, that you are in our power, at our discre- 
tion, that no human power can take you away from here, and that 
we should be really grieved to be obliged to proceed to unpleasant 
extremities. I know neither your name nor your address, but I give 
you notice that you will remain tied until the person whose duty 
it will be to carry the letter which you are about to write, has re^* 
turned. Have the kindness now to write.” 

“What ?” asked the prisoner. 

“I will dictate.” 

M. Leblanc took the pen. 

Thenardier began to dictate : 

“My daughter — ” 

The prisoner shuddered and lifted his eyes to Thenardier. 

“Put ‘my dear daughter,’ ” said Thenardier. M. Leblanc obeyed. 
Thaiardier continued : 

“Come immediately — ” 

He stopped. 

“You call her daughter, do you not ?” 

“Who ?” asked M. Leblanc. 

“Zounds !” said Thenardier, “the little girl, the Lark.” 

M. Leblanc answered without the least apparent emotion: 

“I do not know what you mean.” 

“Well, go on,” said Th&amp;iardier, and he began to dictate again. 

“Come immediately, I have imperative need of you. The person 
who will give you this note is directed to bring you to me. I am wait- 
ing for you. Come with confidence.” 

M. Leblanc had written the whole. Thenardier added : 

“Ah ! strike out come with confidence, that might lead her to sup* 
pose that the thing is not quite clear and that distrust is possible.” 

M. Leblanc erased the three words. 



678 L E S M I S 6 S A B L E S 

“Now,” continued Theiiardicr, “si,t{n it. What is your name?’' 

The prisoner laid down the pen anti asked : 

“For whom is this letter?” 

“You know very well,” answcrwl 'fhenardier, “for the little ghi 
I have j list told you.” 

It was evident that Thenardicr avi tided naming the young gid 
in question. He said “the Lark," he saal "die little .e,'! !,”’liut he did 
not pronounce the name. The precaution of a shrewii man preserv- 
ing his own secret before his accomplices. Tti speak the name wouki 
have been to give up the whole “aifair" to them, ant] to tell them more 
than they needed to know. 

He resumed : 

“Sign it. Wliat is your name?" 

“Urbain Falire,” .said the pri.sfiner. 

Thenardier, with the movemenl of a cal. ihrnsi his bant! into his 
pocket and pulled out the hamlkerchiel taken fsHnu .M. l.eblanc. He 
looked for the mark upon it and hidtl it up to the eand’e. 

. “U. 1-. Jhtit is it. Urbtiin Ihihre. Well, si..,, H. j.'.” 

The prisoner .si,gned. 

“.Vs it takes two liands to fold tlie It. iter, give it to me, I will fold 
it.’’ 

This done, Thenardier re.'anned : 

“J'nt on the adflre.ss, .l/..'«/c»;e,T /.V' .at vniir Imuse, I know 

that 3'ou live not verv far from luaf. in the luv.dii'omlioml tif .Saint

As you have not lied ahont your narne, y.m will not ’lie nl.toiit yrmr

The prisoner remained thoughtful for a moment, tlien he. took 
the i&gt;cn and wrote: 

“Mademoiselle Isaltre, at Momdenr ribain I-', dire's, Ptte Saint 
Dominique d'Fufer, No. 17.” 

Thenardier seized the letter witlt a sort of fv,'verisli convulsive 
movement. 

"Wife!'; crk-tl he. 

Tire Thenardiess .sjiraiig forward. 

. “Hm* is tlte letter. Ytm know what yon have to do. There is a 
fiacre below. Co right away, aiul eonie leu k diiio.” 

And addressing tlte mail with the pole ase: 

“Here, .since you have taken off y our Itiilc yom -nose, go with the 
woman. S’ou will get up Wiind the fiacre. Yoii know where you left 
tlie maniifjotti',*' 

“Yes,” .said the man. 

And. laying down l«s pole-axe in a eorner, he followed tlte 
Thenanliess. 



MARIUS 679 

As they were going away, Thenardier put his head through the 
half -open door and screamed into the hall : 

‘'Above all things do not lose the letter ! remember that you have 
two hundred thousand francs with you.” 

The harsh voice of the Thenardiess answered : 

“Rest assured, I have put it in my bosom.” 

A minute had not passed when the snapping of a whip was heard, ' 
which grew fainter and rapidly died away. 

“Good !” muttered Thenardier. “They are going good speed. At 
that speed the bourgeoise will be back in three quarters of an hour.” 

He drew a chair near the fireplace and sat down, folding his arms 
.and holding his muddy boots up to the furnace. 

“My feet are cold,” said he. 

There were now but five bandits left in the den with Th&amp;iardier 
and the prisoner. These men, through the masks or the black varnish 
which covered their faces and made of them, as fear might suggest, 
charcoal men, negroes, or demons, had a heavy and dismal appear- 
ance, and one felt that they would execute a crime as they would p/^y 
drudgery, quietly, without anger and without mercy, w;ith a sort of 
irksomeness. They were heaped together in a corner like brutes^ 
and were silent. Thenardier was warming his feet. The prisoner had 
relapsed into his taciturnity. A gloomy stillness had succeeded the 
savage tumult which filled the garret a few moments before. 

The candle, in which a large thief had formed, hardly lighted up 
the enormous den, the fire had grown dull, and all their monstrous 
heads made huge shadows on the walls and on the ceiling. 

No sound could be heard save the quiet breathing of the drunken 
old man, who was asleep. 

Marius was waiting in an anxiety which everything increased. The 
riddle was more impenetrable than ever. Who was this “little girl,” 
whom Thenardier had also called the Lark? was it his “Ursula'^? 
The prisoner had not seemed to be moved by this word, the Lark, 
and answered in the most natural way in the world: I do not know 
what you mean. On the other hand, the two letters U. F. were ex- 
plained; it was Urbain Fabre, and Ursula's name was no longer 
Ursula. This Marius saw most clearly. A sort of hideous fascination 
held him spellbound to the place from which he observed and com- 
manded the whole scene. There he was, almost incapable of reflection 
and motion, as if annihilated by such horrible things in so close 
proximity. He was waiting, hoping for some movement, nO matter 
what, unable to collect his ideas and not knowing what course to take. 

“At all events," said be, “if the Lark is she, I shall certainly see 
her, for the Thenardiess is going to bring her here. Then all will 
be plain. I will give my blood and my life if need be, but I will de-- 
liver her. Nothing shall stop me.” 

Nearly half an hour passed thus, Thenardier appeared absorbed

in a dark meditation, the prisoner (!id lu ,siir. Xevertludess Marius

T hese few words seeined promise a cleariue up, Marius listened

MARIUS 681 

seeking some hope and finding more. The tumult of his thoughts 
strangely contrasted with the deathly silence of the den. 

In the midst of this silence they heard the sound of the door of 
the stairway which opened, then closed. 

The prisoner made a movement in his bonds. 

"‘Here is the bourgeoise/’ said Thenardier. 

He had hardly said this, when in fact the Thenardiess burst m&lt;*o 
the room, red, breathless, panting, with glaring eyes, and cried, strik-, 
ing her hands upon her hips both at the sarne time : 

“False address 

The bandit whom she had taken with her, came in behind her and 
picked up his pole-axe again : 

“False address ?” repeated Thenardier. 

She continued : 

“Nobody ! Rue Saint Dominique, number seventeen, no Monsieur 
Urbain Fabre ! They do not know who he is !*’ 

She stopped for lack of breath, then continued : 

“Monsieur Thenardier ! this old fellow has cheated you ! you are 
too good, do you see ! I would have cut up the Mm^goulette for you 
in quarters, to begin with ! and if he had been ugly, I would have 
cooked him alive ! Then he would have had to talk, and had to tell 
where the girl is, and had to tell where the rhino is ! That is how I 
would have fixed it ! No wonder that they say men are stupider than 
women! Nobody! number seventeen! It is a large porte-cochere! 
No Monsieur Fabre ! Rue Saint Dominique, full gallop, and drink- 
money to the driver, and all ! I spoke to the porter and the portress, 
who is a fine stout woman, they did not know the fellow.’^ 

Marius breathed. She, Ursula or the Lark, she whom he no longer 
knew what to call, was safe. 

While his exasperated wife was vociferating, Thenardier had 
seated himself on the table; he sat a few seconds without saying 
a word, swinging his right leg, which waS hanging down, and gazing 
upon the furnace with a look of S|vage reverie. 

At last he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious 
inflexion: 

“A false address ! what did you hope for by that?'’ 

“To gain time !" cried the prisoner with a ringing voice. 

And at the same moment he shook off his bonds ; they were cut. . 
The prisoner was no longer fastened to the bed save by one leg. 

Before the seven men had had time to recover themselves and 
spring upon him, he had bent over to the fireplace^ reached hi'STiand 
towards the furnace, then rose up, and now Thenardier, the The- 
nardiess, and the bandits, thrown by the shock into the back part of 
the room, beheld him with stupefaction, holding above his head the 
glowing chisel, from which fell an.ominous light, almost free and 
in a f ormidable attitude. 



682 LES MISiRABLES 

At the judicial inquest, to which the amlniscade in the Gorbeau 
tenement gave rise in the sequel, it appeared that a big sou, cut and 
worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the 
police made a descent upon it ; this big sou was one of those marvels 
of labour which the patience of the galleys ])roduces in the darkness 
and for the darkness, marvels which are nothing else but instruments 
of escape. These hideous and delicate products of a wonderful art 
are to jewellery what themetapliors of argot are to poetry. There are 
Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, even as there are Villons in lan- 
guage. The unhappy man who aspires t() deliverance, finds the means, 
sometimes without tools, with a folding ktiife, with an old case 
knife, to split a sou into two thin jilates, to hollow out these two 
plates without touching the stamp of the mint, and to cut a screw- 
thread upon the edge of the sou, so ils to make the plates adhere 
anew. This screws and unscrew.s at will ; it is a bo.v. In this box, they 
conceal a watch-spring, and this watch-sju-ing, well handled, cuts 
off I’ings of some size and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is 
supposed to possess only a sou ; no, he possessc's liberty. A big sou 
of this kind, on subsequent examination by the police, was found 
open and in two pjcces in the room under the pallet near the window. 
There was also discovered a little .saw of hlne steel which could be 
concealed in the big sou. It is i)rohahle that when the bandits were 
seai-ching the prisoner’s pockets, he htid this Ing sou upon him and 
succeeded in hiding it in his hand ; and that afterwards, having his 
right hand free, he unscrewed it and used the saw to cut the ropes 
by which he was fastened, which would explain the slight noise and 
the imperceptible movements w’liich Marius hud noticed. 

Being unable to stoop down for fear of betraying himself, he had 
not cut the cords on hi.s left leg. 

The bandits had recovered their first .suri&gt;rise. 

“Be easy,” said Bigrenaille to Thenardier. “He hokLs yet by one 
leg, and he will not go olf, I answer for that. I tied that shank for 
him.'” 

The prisoner now raised his voice : 

“You are pitiable, but my life is not worth the trouble of .so long 
a defence. As to your imagining that you could tnake me .speak, that 
you could make me write what I tlo not wish to write, that you could 
make me say what I do not wish to .say ” 

He pulled up the sleeve of hi.s left arm, and added: 

“Here.” 

At the .same time he extentlcd his arm. and Isiid upon the naked 
flesh the glowing chisel, which he held in his right hand, by the 
wooden handle. 

They heard the hissing of the burning flesh ; the odour peculiar 
to chambers of torture spread through the den. Marius staggered, 
lost m horror j the brigands them.selves felt a shudder; the face of 



MARIUS 683 

the wonderful old man hardly contracted, and while the red iron 
was sinking into the smoking, impassable, and almost august wound, 
he turned upon Thenardier his fine face, in which there was no 
hatred, and in which suffering was swallowed up in a serene maj- 
esty. 

With great and lofty natures the revolt of the flesh and the senses 
against the assaults of physical pain, brings ouf the soul, and makes 
it appear on the countenance, in the same way as mutinies of the 
soldiery force the captain to show himself. 

''Wretches,'' said he, "have no more fear for me than I have of 
you.'^ 

And drawing the chisel out of the wound, he threw it through 
the window, which was still open ; the horrible glowing tool disap- 
peared, whirling into the night, and fell in the distance, and was 
quenched in the snow. 

The prisoner resumed : 

"Do with me what you will." 

He was disarmed. 

"Lay hold of him," said Thenardier. 

Two of the brigands laid their hands upon his shoulders, and the 
masked man with the ventriloquist's voice placed himself in front of 
him, ready to knock out his brains with a blow of- the key, at the 
least motion. 

At the same time Marius heard beneath him, at the foot of the 
partition, but so near that he could not see those who were talking, 
this colloquy, exchanged in a low voice : 

"There is only one thing more to do." 

"To kill him!" 

"That is it." 

It was the husband and wife who were holding counsel. 

Thenardier walked with slow steps towards the table, opened the 
drawer, and took out the knife. 

Marius was tormenting the trigger of his pistol. Unparalleled per- 
plexity 1 For an hour there had been two voices in his conscience, one 
telling him to respect the will of his father, the other crying to him 
to succour the prisoner. These two voices, without interruption, 
continued their struggle, which threw him into agony. He had 
vaguely hoped up to that moment to find some means of reconGiling 
these two duties, but no possible way had arisen. The peril was noW' 
urgent, the last limit of hope was passed ; at a few steps from the 
prisoner, Thenardier was reflecting, with the knife in his hand. 

Marius cast his eyes wildly about him ; the last mechanical resource 
of despair. 

Suddenly he started. 

At his feet, on the table, a clear ray of the full moon illuminated, 
and seemed to point out to him a sheet of 'paper. Upon that sheet 



684 L E S M I S K R A H I. E S 

lie read this line, written in large letters that very nmniin'' he th* 
eWer of the Thenardier girls : ‘ 

“The Cocxks aki: itERi;." 

An idea, a Hash crussetl Muritts' tuiml ; that was the means which 
he sought ; the solution of this dreadl'ii! lii'ohh'iii whit h was tortur- 
ing him, tti spare the assassin anil to save tin- vietini. He knelt down 
upon his bureau, reached out his ariii, caught up tlie sheet of paper 
quietly detached a hit of jilaster fnun the pariiiion, wrapped it in 
the paper, and threw the whole through the creviee into the middle 
of the den. 

It was time. Thenaialier Inul eoitiitierei! his last tears, or his last 
scruples, and was moving towiinis the pri -oner. 

“.Soinetliing fell!" cried the Thenardiess.

And he ni.sheil townrtls the window 



MARIUS 685 

But as he was stepping out, Bigrenaille seized him roughly by the 
collar. 

“No; say now, old joker! after us/’ 

“After us 1” howled the bandits. 

“You are children,” said Thenardier. “We are losing .time. The 
railles are at our heels.” 

“Well/’ said one of the bandits, “let us draw.lots who shall go out 
first.”^ 

Thenardier exclaimed : 

“Are you fools ? are you cracked ? You are a mess of jobards! Los- 
ing time, isn’t it?. drawing lots, isn’t it? with a wet finger! for the 
short straw ! write our names ! put them in a cap I ” 

“Would you like my hat?” cried a voice from the. door. 

They all turned round. It was Javert. 

He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out smiling. 


XXI 

THE VICTIMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ARRESTED FIRST 

Javert, at nightfall, had posted his men and hid himself behind the 
trees on the Rue de la Barriere des Gobelins, which fronts the Gor- 
beau tenement on the other side of the boulevard. He commenced 
by opening “his pocket,” to put into it the two young girls, who were 
charged with watching the approaches to the den. But he only “bag- 
ged” Azelma. As for Eponine, she was not at her post ; she had dis- 
appeared, and he could not take her. Then Javert put himself in 
rest, and listened for the signal agreed upon. The going and coming 
of the fiacre fretted him greatly. At last, he became impatient, and, 
sure that there wair a nest there, sure of being “in good luck/^ having

to go up without waiting for the pistol shot 

It will be remembered that he had Marius’ pass-key, , 

He had come at the right time. 

The frightened bandits rushed for the arms which they had 
thrown down anywhere when they had attempted to escape. In less 
than a second, these seven men, terrible to look upon, were grouped 
in a posture of defence ; one with his pole-axe, another with his key, 
a third with his club, the others with the shears, the pincers, and the 
hammers, Thenardier grasping his knife. The Thenardiess seized 
a huge paving-stone which was in the corner of the window, and 
which served her daughters for a cricket 

Javert put on his hat again, and stepped into the room, his arms 
folded, his cane under his arm, his sword in its sheath. 

“Halt there,” said he. “You will not pass out through the win- 
dow, you will pass out through the door. It is less unwholesome* :

Javert smiled, and advanced into the open space which the The- 
nardiess was watching with all her eyes. 

“Don't come near ! get out,” cried she, “or I will crush you !” 

“What a grenadier !” said Javert ; “mother, you have a beard like 
a man, but I have claws like a woman.” 

And he continued to advance. 

The Thenardiess, her hair flying wildly and terrible, braced her 
legs, bent backwards, and threw the paving stone wildly at Javert's 
head. Javert stooped, the stone passed over him, hit the wall behind, 
from which it knocked down a large piece of the plastering, and 
returned, bounding from corner to corner across the room, luckily 
almost empty, finally stopping at Javert’s heels. 

At that moment Javert reached the Thenardier couple. One of his 
huge hands fell upon the shoulder of the woman, and the other upon 
her husband's head. 

“The handcuffs !” cried he. 

The police officers returned in a body, and in a few seconds Ja- 
vert’s order was executed. 

The Thenardiess, completely crushed, looked at her manacled 
hands and those of her husband, dropped to the floor and exclaimed, 
with tears in her eyes : 

“My daughters !” 

“They are provided for,” said Javert. 

Meanwhile the officers had found the drunken fellow who was 
asleep behind the door, and shook him. He awoke stammering. 

“Is it over, Jondrette?” 

“Yes,” answered Javert. 

The six manacled bandits were standing ; however, they still re- 
tained their spectral appearance, three blackened, three masked. 

“Keep on your masks,” said Javert. 

And, passing them in review with the eye of a Frederic II. at 
parade at Potsdam, he said to the three “chimney doctors 

“Good day, Bigrenaille. Good day, Brujon. Good day, Deux Mil- 
liards.” 

Then, turning towards the three masks, he said to the man of the 
pole-axe: 

“Good day, Gueulemer.” 

And to the man of the cudgel: 

“Good day, Babet,'' 

And to the ventriloquist : 

“Your health, Claquesous,” 

Just then he perceived the prisoner of the bandits, who, since the 
entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had held his heac 
down. 

“Untie monsieur I” said Javert^ “and let nobody go ont.” 

This said, he sat down with authority before the table, on whicl

the candle and the writinj^ materials still were, drew a staniju'd sheet 
from his pockety and cnnnuenced his j&gt;rt»ct‘s verlnal. 

When he had written tlie lirst lines, a part nf the ftvrnmiu, which 
is always the same, he raise&lt;l his eves : 

“Bring fnrwarc! the ,i(t*ntlenmn wlmm these gent Itanen luid huund/* 

Tlie officers looked about them. 

“Well/' asked Javert, “where is he now?“ 

The prisoner of the bandits, M. Leldani*, M. rrhain Isabre, the 
father of Ursula, or tlw. lark, had flisapp^ared. 

The door was guarded, hut the windi^w was nut As soon as he 
{Sawthat he was tinhontahantl while Javaai wu:^ writing, he had taken

head could be seen. One would have said it was the mask o£ Decrep- 
itude shrivelled by a flash in the night. The child looked at her. 

“Madame/’ said he, “has not the style of beauty that suits me.” 

He went on his way and began to sing again : 

Le roi Coup desabot 
S’en allait a la chasse, 

A la chasse aux corbeaux — 

At the end of these three lines he stopped. He had reached No. 
50 - 52 , and finding the door locked, had begun to batter it with kicks, 
heroic and re-eclioing kicks, that revealed rather the men’s shoes 
which he wore, than the child’s feet which he had. 

Meantime, this same old woman, whom he had met with at the 
corner of the Rue dii Petit Banquier, was running after him with 
much clamour and many crazy gestures. What’s the matter ? what’s 
the matter ? Good God ! They are staving the door down ! They area 
breaking into the house ! '' 

The kicks continued. 

The old woman exhausted her lungs. 

“Is that the way they use houses nowadays ?” 

Suddenly she stopped. She had recognised the gamin, 

“What ! it is that Satan !” 

“Hullo, it is the old woman,” said the child. “Good day, Burgon- 
muche. I have come to see my ancestors.” 

The old woman responded, with a composite grimace, an admir- 
able extemporisation of hatred making the most of decay and ugli- 
ness, which was unfortunately lost in the obscurity : 

“There is nobody there, nosey.” 

“Pshaw !” said the child, “where is my father, theni” 

“At La Force.” 

“Heigho ! and my mother ?” 

“At Saint Lazarc.” 

“Well ! and my sisters ?” 

“At Les Madelonnettcs.” 

The child scratched the back of his ear, looked at Ma’am Burgon 
and said : 

“Ah!” 

Then he turned on his heel, and a moment afterwards, the old 
woman, who stopped on the doorstep, heard him sing with his clear, 
fresh voice, as he disappeared under the black elms shivering in the 
wintry winds :

BOOK FIRST— A FEW PAGES OF HISTORY 

I 

WELL CUT 

The years 1831 and 1832, the two years immediately connected 
with the Revolution of July, are one of the most peculiar and most 
striking periods in history. These two years, among those which 
precede and those which follow them, are like two mountains. They 
have the revolutionary grandeur. In them we discern precipices. 
In them the social masses, the very strata of civilisation, the con- 
solidated group of superimposed and cohering interests, the vener- 
able profile of the old French formation, appear and disappear at 
every instant through the stormy clouds of systems, passions, and 
theories. These appearances and disappearances have been named 
resistance and movement. At intervals we see truth gleaming forth, 
that daylight of the human soul. * 

This remarkable period is short enough, and is beginning to be 
far enough from us, so that it is henceforth possible to catch its 
principal outlines. 

We will make the endeavour. 

The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, diffi- 
cult of definition, in which there are fatigue, buzzings, murmurs, 
slumber, tumult, and which are nothing more nor less than the ar- 
rival of a great nation at a halting-place. These periods are peculiar, 
and deceive the politicians who would take advantage of them. At 
first, the nation asks only for repose; men have but one thirst, for 
peace ; they have but one ambition, to be little. That is a translation 
of being quiet. Great events, great fortunes, great ventures, great 
men, thank God, they have seen enough of them ; they have been 
overhead in them. They would exchange Csesar for Prusias, and 
Napoleon for the king of Yvetot. "'What a good little king he was 
They have walked since daybreak, it is the evening of a long and 
rough day; they made the first relay with Mirabeau, the second 
with Robespierre, the third with Bonaparte, they are thqrpughljr 
exhausted. Every one of them asks for a bed. ^ ^ . 

Devotions wearied out, heroisms grown old, ambitions/full-f ed, 
fortunes made, all seek, demand, implore, solicit, what? A*pkee td 
lie down? They have it. They take possession of peace^ ftne^ 
and leisure ; they are content. At the s^ame time, however, Certain 
facts arise&gt; compel recognition, and knock at the door on their side*

also. These facts have sprunj^ from revolutions anti wars ; they exist 
they live, they have a rii;iit lo instai thmisflvt's in society, and they 
do instai themselves ;and the nu&gt;st ttf the time the facts are pioneers 
and (quartermasters that merely [freitare the ij;r&lt;nmd ftn* i&gt;rinciples. 

Then, that is wliat apinsars t»&gt; the |&gt;olitieaI t)lhlosti|»lier. 

At tlie same time that weary men clejuand rej)iise, accomplished 
facts demand guarantees* Guarantees tt* fads are the same thing as 
repose to’ lycn. 

This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after tlie Protec- 
tor ; this is what h'rance demanded i»f t!u* Ihmrhons after the empire. 

Tliese guarantees are a lUTessity of tlu* limes. Tiny must be ac- 
corded* The princes **grant*' theni, but in r(‘aliiy it is the force of 
circumstances which gives tluam A |irofound truth, and a piece of 
useful knowledge, u{ which tiu‘ Stuarts had no suspicion in 1662 
and of which tlie iiottrbons h‘id even a rdinipse iti ISM. * 

The predestitied family which rettirnctl Ui b'ranar vv!u‘n Napoleon 
fell, had the fatal simjdicity to heli(*V(’ dial it was it that gave, and 
that what it had given it could take back ; that the house (g* bourbon 
possessed Divine Eight, that b* ranee possessed lunhitig ; and that the 
jxditical rights concedeil in the i hartia’ of I ouis X\1 1 1. were only 
a Immcli of the divine right, detached !»y the Ibnise. of I&gt;ourbot\ 
and graciottsly given to (Ih» people until sutii day as it should please 
the king to take it hack again. Siill* by tlie regret which tlie gift cost 
them, the Ikntrhons should have feh that it did mn c^nne from them. 

They were surly with the nineteentli eentury. They matle a sour 
face at every development of the nation. ’To mlopt a trivial word, 
that is to say, a papular and a true oih*, they bn iked glum. Hie people 
saw it. 

They believed that they were strong, Invause tlie tanpire had been 
swept away before tluan like a scime ai a llicatre, 1liey did not per- 
ceive that lluy themselves had been lirought in m t!u‘ same way. 
They did not see that they also were in iliat hand whicli hml taken oif 
Napoleon. 

^ They belkyed that tltey were moled because they were the past. 
They were mistaken ; they were a portion of the past, Inu the whole 
past was France. 'Hie routs of hVeneli sradeiy were not in Bourlions 
but in the nation, Hiese obscure and untlying roots did not consti- 
tute the right of a family, hut the history of n people, dliey were 
everywhere except under the tliroMe, 

Tile house of Bourbon was to !*&gt;:ince the illustrious and blood- 
stained knot of lier history, but it was umI the prineipai element of 
her destiny, or the essential basis of her pilitics. Site could do with- 
out the Bourbons ; site had done wilhout them for twenty-two years ; 
there had been a solution of continuity ; they did not susjwt it, And 
how should they sus}iect it, they who imaijirifc! tliat Louis XVII.

on the day of Marengo. Never, since the beginning of history, have, 
princes been so blind in the presence of facts, and of the portwn of 
divine authority which facts contain and promulgate. Never had 
that earthly pretension which is called the right of kings, denied 
the divine right to such an extent. 

A capital error which led that family to lay its hand upon the 
guarantees '‘granted’’ in 1814, upon the concessions, as it called 
them. Sad thing ! what they called their concessions were our con- 
quests ; what they called our encroachments were our rights. 

When its hour seemed come, the Restoration, supposing itself vic- 
torious over Bonaparte, and rooted in the country, that is to say, 
thinking itself strong and thinking itself deep, took its resolution 
abruptly and risked its throw. One morning it rose in the face of 
France, and, lifting up its voice, it denied the collective title and the 
individual title, sovereignty to the nation, liberty to the citizen. In 
, other words, it denied to the nation what made it a nation, and to the 
citizen what made him a citizen. 

This is the essence of those famous acts which are called the 
ordinances of July. 

The Restoration fell. 

It fell justly. We must say, however, that it had not been abso- 
lutely hostile to all forms of progress. Some grand things were done 
in its presence. 

Under the Restoration the nation became accustomed to discussion 
with calmness, which was wanting in the republic ; and to grandeur 
in peace, which was wanting in the empire. France, free and strong, 
had been an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of Europe. 
The Revolution had had its say under Robespierre ; the cannon had 
had its say under Bonaparte ; under Louis XVIIL and Charles X. 
intelligence in its turn found speech. The wind ceasbd, the torch 
was relighted. The pure light of mind was seen trembling upon the 
serene summits. A magnificent spectacle, full of use and charm. For 
-fifteen years there were seen at work, in complete peace, and openly 
in public places, these great principles, so old to the thinker, so new 
to the statesman : equality before the law, freedom of conscience, 
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the accessibility of every 
function to every aptitude. This went on thus until 1830. The Bour- 
bons were an instrument of civilisation, which broke in the hands 
of Providence. 

The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their part, 
but on the part of the nation. They left the throne with gravity, but 
without authority ; their descent into the night was not one of those 
solemn disappearances which leave a dark emotion to history; it 
was neither the spectral calmness of Charles I., nor the eagle cry of 
Napoleon. They went away, that is all. They laid off the crown, and 
did not keep the halo. They were worthy, but they were not august.

S A I N T D E N I S 697 

The right is the just and the true. 

The peculiarity of the right is that it is always beautiful and pure. 
The fact, even that which is most necessary in appearance, even that 
most accepted by its contemporaries, if it exist only as fact, and if it 
contain too little of the right, or none at all, is destined infallibly to 
become, in the lapse of time, deformed, unclean, perhaps even mon- 
strous. If you would ascertain at once what degree of ugliness the 
fact may reach, seen in the distance of the centuries, look at Mach- 
iavel. Machiavel is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a cowardly 
and miserable writer ; he is nothing but the fact. And he is not merely 
the Italian fact, he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth 
century. He seems hideous, and he is so, in presence of the moral 
idea of the nineteenth.' 

This conflict of the right and the fact endures from the origin of 
society. To bring the duel to an end, to amalgamate the pure ideal 
with the human reality, to make the right peacefully interpenetrate 
the fact, and the fact the right, this is the work of the wise. 


II 

BADLY SEWED 

But the work of the wise is one thing, the work of the able another. 

The Revolution of 1830 soon grounded. 

As soon as the revolution krikes the shore, the able carve up the 
wreck. 

The able, in our age, have decreed to themselves the title of states- 
men, so that this word, statesman, has come to be, in some sort, a 
word of argot. Indeed, let no one forget, wherever there is ability 
only, there is necessarily pettiness. To say "'the able,'' amounts to 
saying, “mediocrity." 

Just as saying, “statesmen," is sometimes equivalent to saying 
“traitors," 

According to the able, therefore, revolutions such as the Revolu- 
tion of July, are arteries cut ; a prompt ligature is needed. The right, 
too grandly proclaimed, is disquieting. So, the right once affirmed, 
the state must be reaffirmed. Liberty being assured, we must take 
thought for power. • 

Thns far the wise do not separate from the able, but they begin 
to distrust. Power, very well. But, first, what is power ? Secondly, 
whence comes it 

The able seem not to hear the murmurs of objection, and ♦they 
continue their work. . ' 

According to these politicians, ingenious in putting a rhask of 
necessity upon profitable fictions, the first need of a people after 
a revolution, if this people forms part of a monarchical continent.

ress, quasi right. Now logic ignores the Almost, just as the sun ig- 
nores the candle. 

Who stops revolutions half-way ? The bourgeoisie. 

Why? 

Because the bourgeoisie is the interest which has attained to 
satisfaction. Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is fulness, to-mor- 
row it will be satiety. 

The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon, was reproduced in 
1830 after Charles X. 

There has been an attempt, an erroneous one, to make a special 
class of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented 
portion of the people. The bourgeois is the man who has now time to 
sit down. A chair is not a caste. 

But, by wishing to sit down, we may stop the progress even of 
the human race.^ That has often been the fault of the bourgeois. 

The commission^ of a fault does not constitute a class. Egotism 
is not one of the divisions of the social order. 

Moreover, we must be just even towards egotism. The state to 
which, after the shock of 1830, that part of the nation which is called 
bourgeoisie aspired, was not inertia, which is a complication of in- 
difference and idleness, and which contains something of shame; 
it was not slumber, which supposes a momentary forgetfulness ac- 
cessible to dreams ; it was a halt. 

Halt is a word formed with a singular and almost contradictory 
double meaning : a troop on the march, that is to say, movement ; a 
stopping, that is to say, repose. 

Halt is the regaining of strength, it is armed and watchful re- 
pose ; it is the accomplished fact which plants sentinels and keeps it- 
self upon its guard. Halt supposes battle yesterday and battle to- 
morrow. 

This is the interval between 1830 and 1848. 

What we here call battle may also be called progress. 

The bourgeoisie, then, as well as the statesmen, felt the need of a 
man who should express this word : Halt ! An Although Because, A 
composite individuality, signifying revolution and signifying sta- 
bility ; in other words, assuring the present through the evident 
compatibility of the past with the future. 

This man was “found at hand.”^ His name was Louis Philippe 
d'Oi'leans. 

The 221 made Louis Philippe king. Lafayette undertook the 
coronation. He called it the best of republics. The^Hotel de Ville of 
Paris replaced the Cathedral of Rheims. : 

This substitution of a demi-throne for the complete throne was 
“the work of 1830.^' 

When the able had finished their work, the inlmense viciousness 
of their solution became apparent. All this 'Vvas done without refer-

terious unanimities which mutter almost inaudibly beneath thrones ; 
expansive, sometimes imprudent in his expansion, but with marvel- 
lous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, in faces, in 
masks; making France afraid of Europe and Europe of France; 
loving his country incontestably, but preferring his family; prizing 
domination more than authority, and authority more than dignity ; 
a disposition which is to this extent fatal, that, turning everything 
towards success, it admits of ruse, and does not absolutely repudiate 
baseness ; but which is profitable to this extent, that it preserves 
politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and society 
from catastrophies ; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious, 
indefatigable ; contradicting himself sometimes, and giving himself 
the lie ; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England 
in Spain, bombarding Antwerp and paying Pritchard ; singing the 
Marseillaise with conviction ; inaccessible to depression, to weari- 
ness, to taste for the beautiful and the ideal, tq foolhardy generos- 
ity, to Utopia, to chimeras, to anger, to vanity, to fear ; having every 
form of personal bravery; general at Valmy, soldier at Jemappes, 
his life attempted eight times by regicides, yet always smiling ; brave 
as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker ; anxious merely before the 
chances of a Eui'opean disturbance, and unfit for great political ad- 
ventures; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising 
his pleasure in the form of influence that he might be obeyed rather 
as an intelligence than as a king; endowed with observation and not 
with divination, paying little attention to minds, but able to read the 
character of men, that is to say, needing to see in order to judge; 
prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, ready speech, 
prodigious memory; digging incessantly into that memory, his only 
point of resemblance with Csesar, Alexander, and Napoleon ; know- 
ing facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies, pas- 
sions, the diverse genii of the multitude, interior aspirations, the 
hidden and obscure uprisings of souls, in one word, all that might 
be called the invisible currents of conscience ; accepted by the sur- 
face, but little in accord with the under-France ; making his way by 
ci'aft ; governing too much and not reigning enough ; his own prime 
minister ; excelling in making of the pettiness of realities an obstacle 
to the immensity of ideas ; adding to a true creative faculty for civili- 
sation, order, and organisation, an indescribable spirit of routine 
and chicanery, founder and attorney of a dynasty ; possessing some- 
thing of Charlemagne and something of a lawyer; to sum up, a 
lofty and original figure, a prince who knew how to gain powers in 
spite of the restlessness of France, and power in spite of the jealousy 
of Europe. Louis Philippe will be classed among the eminent men 
of his century, and would be ranked among the most illustrious rul- 
ers of history if he had had a little love of glory, and had appreciated 
what is great to the same extent that he appreciated w;hgt isuU^^

Louis Philipjje lud been hatidsome, and, when old, was still fine 
looking; not always agrcealile to the naiinn, lie always was to the 
multitude ; he pleased, l ie had this gift, a eharni. Majesty he lacked; 
he neither wore the crown, thinigh king, nor while liair, though an 
old maji. His manners were of llte oUl regime, and his li.abits of the 
new, a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which was befitting 
to 1^0; Louis Philippe was regnant transition: he had preserved 
the ancient pronunciation and ihe anciiait orthography which he 
put into the .service of modern opinions ; he lovwl I’oland and Hun- 
gary, Init he wrote lex pohmmx, :ind prrtnounced lux Itoitfiraix. He 
wore the dress of the Nalional Guard like Gliarles X., and the cordon 
of the Legion of Honunr like Napoleon. 

.He went randy to ehaiiel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera. 
Incorruptilile by priests, dug keejn-rs. and lianseirses ; this entered 
into his popularity with the honrgi'oisie. He hail no eonrt. He went 
out with his umlirella niuler his arm. and this uinhrella for a long 
time was a portion of his glory. 1 !e was something of a mason, some- 
thing of a gardener, aiul soniethiiig t&lt;f a iloelor ; lie hied a ]H)stillion 
who fell from his lior.se; Louis I’liilippe iio more wmit without his 
lancet lh:m .Henry III. without ids |ioiiiard. The roy.di.sts laughed 
at this ridicnlons king, tlie tirst wlio had spilled blood to save. ' 

In the complaints of history agidnst Li'iiis I'liiiippe, there i.s a 
dednetion to be made, there is \%'hal is to he diargeii to the royalty, 
wluit: is to be cliarged to the reign, and what i*. to lie eiuirged to the 
king ; lltree colnnins, eaclt of which gi%es a .iiffereiu total, 'flie right 
of democracy confiscated, progre.s.s made the secoml interest, the 
prote.sts of tfte street violeitlly repressed, the military execution of 
insurrections, cnicutes passed over in- arms, the kiie 'fninsnon.am, 
the councils of war, the absorption of the real country liy the legal 
country, the theory of the govnnmenl but half c.in'ied' out, with 
three hundred thousand priviiegeti per*.on,, arc the act.s of the roy- 
alty : Bcigitnn refused, Algeria tooliarslilv conijtiereri, and, like India 
by the ICfiglish, with more of baiharism tlian civilis;iiion, the breach 
of faith with Ahd&gt;cMviuler, lUaye, Hentz imrcliased, Prilchtird 
paid, are the acts of tlie reign ; the policv, which looked raflter to the 
family than to the iiatimi, is the ;ict of tin- king. 

As we see, when the dcductioti is made, i lie cii.irge against the king 
is diminished. 

His great fatili was this: He w.is modes) in the mime of France, 

W'ltcnee comes this fault ? 

We must tell. 

Louis l‘hilippe wa.s a too fatherly king; tltis incubation of a 
family which is to lie hatched htn a dynasty is afraid of everything, 
and c,annot bc.nr distnrlianrc ; hence excessive timidity, annoying to 
a people who have the Mth of [uly in their, civil traditioi'ra, and 
Austerlit* in their military tradilbm. 



SAINT DENIS 703 

Moreover, if we throw aside public duties, which first demand 
to be fulfilled, this deep tenderness of Louis Philippe for his family, 
the family deserved. This domestic group was wonderful. Their 
virtues emulated their talents. One of Louis Philippe's daughters, 
Maria d'Orleans, put the name of her race among artists as Charles 
d'Orleans had put it among poets. Out of her soul she made a statue 
which she called Jeanne d'Arc. Two of Louis Philippe's sons drew 
from Metternich this eulogy of a demagogue: They are young men 
such as zve rarely see, and princes such as zve never see. 

This is, without keeping anything back, but also without aggra- 
vating anything, the truth about Louis Philippe. 

To be Prince Equality, to bear within himself the contradiction 
of the Restoration and the Revolution, to have this threatening as- 
pect of the revolutionist which becomes reassuring in the ruler, such 
was the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more 
complete adaptation of a man to an event ; the one entered into the 
other, and there was an incarnation. Louis Philippe is 1830 made 
man. Moreover, he had in his favour that grand designation for the 
throne, exile. Pie had been proscribed, a .wanderer, poor. He had 
lived by his labour. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely 
domains in France had sold an old horse, to procure food. At Reiche- 
nau he had given lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide 
did sewing and embroidery. These memories associated with a king, 
rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic. Pie had with his own hands 
demolished the last iron cage of Mont Saint Michel, built by Louis 
XI. and used by Louis XV. Pie was the companion of Dumotiriez, 
he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged to the Jacobin 
Club ; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder ; Danton had said 
to him, ‘‘Young man !" At twenty-four years of age, in '93, being 
M. de Chartres, from the back of an obscure bench in the convention, 
he had been present at the trial of Louis XVL, so well named that 
poor tyrant. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, crushing 
royalty in the king, and the king with the royalty, almost without no- 
ticing the man in the savage overthrow of the idea, the vast storm of 
the tribunal-assembly, the public wrath questioning, Capet not know- 
ing what to answer, the fearful stupefied vacillation of this royal 
head under that terrible blow, the relative innocence of all in that 
catastrophe, of those who condemned as well as of him who was 
condemned ; he had seen these things, he had looked upon this mad 
whirl ; he had seen the centuries appear at the bar of the Convention ; 
he had seen behind Louis XVL, that hapless, responsible by-passer, 
rising up in the darkness, the fear-inspiring criminal, the monarchy ; 
and there was still in his soul a respectful fear before this limitless 
justice of the people, almost as impersonal as the justice of God. 

The efifect which the Revolution produced upon him was tre- 
mendous. Plis memory was like a living impression of those grand

Barriere Saint Jacques ; ‘^practical men” felt the need of a quasi- 
legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories of Casimir 
Perier, who represented the more conservative portions of the bour- 
geoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented its more liberal por- 
tions, Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After 
the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: What a pity that I was not 
zvoiindcd! I cotild have pardoned him. At another time, alluding to 
the resistance of his ministers, he wrote concerning a political con- 
vict, who is one of the noblest figures of our times : His pardon 
is granted, it only remains for me to obtain it. Louis Philippe was as 
gentle as Louis IX., and as good as Henry IV. 

Now, to us, in history where goodness is the pearl of great price, 
he who has been good stands almost above him who has been great. 

Louis Philippe having been estimated with severity by some, 
harshly, perhaps, by others, it is very natural that a man, now him- 
self a phantom, who knew this king, should come forward to testify 
for him before history ; this testimony, whatever it may be, is evi- 
dently and above all disinterested; an epitaph written by a dead 
man is sincere ; one shade may console another shade ; the sharing 
of the same darkness gives the right to praise ; and there is little fear 
that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile : This one flattered the 
other. 


IV 

CREVICES UNDER THE FOUNDATION 

At the moment the drama which we are relating is about to pene- 
trate into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which cover the first 
years of the reign of Louis Philippe, we could not be ambiguous, 
and it was necessary that this book should be explicit in regard to 
this king. 

Louis Philippe entered into the royal authority without violence, 
without direct action on his part, by the action of a revolutionary 
transfer, evidently very distinct from the real aim of the revolution, 
but in which he, the Duke d’Orleans, had no personal initiative. Pie 
was a born prince, and believed himself elected king. He had not 
given himself this command ; he had not taken it ; it had been of- 
fered to him and he had accepted it ; convinced, wrongly in our opin- 
ion, but convinced, that the offer was consistent with right, and that 
the acceptance was consistent with duty. Hence a possession in good 
faith. Now, we say it in all conscience, Louis Philippe being in good 
faith in his possession, and the democracy being in good faith in their 
attack, the terror which arises from social struggles is chargeable 
neither to the king nor to the democracy. A shock of principles re- 
sembles a shock of the elements. The ocean defends the water, the 
hurricane defends the air; the king defends royalty, the democracy

SAINT' DENIS 707 

The old legitimist parties none the less assailed the Revolution of 
1830 with all the violence which springs from false reasoning. Er- 
rors are excellent projectiles. They struck it skilfully just where it 
was vulnerable, at the defect in its cuirass, its want of logic ; they at- 
tacked this revolution in its royalty. They cried to it : Revolution, 
why this king ? Factions are blind men who aim straight. 

This cry was uttered also by the republicans. But, coming from 
them, this cry was logical. What was blindness with the legitimists 
was clear-sightedness with the democrats. The year 1830 had become 
bankrupt with the people. The democracy indignantly reproached 
it with its failure. 

Between the attack of the past and the attack of the future, the 
establishment of July was struggling. It represented the moment, in 
conflict on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the other 
hand with the eternal right. 

Moreover, externally, being no longer the revolution, and becom- 
ing the monarchy, 1830 was obliged to keep step with Europe. To 
preserve peace, an increase of complication. A harmony required in 
the wrong way is often more onerous than a war. From this sullen 
conflict, always muzzled but always muttering, is born armed peace, 
that ruinous expedient of civilisation suspected by herself. The 
royalty of July reared, in spite of the lash, in the harness of the 
European cabinets. Metternich would have been glad to put it in 
kicking-straps. Pushed upon in France by progress, it pushed upon 
the monarchies in Europe, those tardigrades. Towed, it towed. 

Meanwhile, within the country, pauperism, proletariat, wages, 
education, punishment, prostitution, the lot of woman, riches, mis- 
ery, production, consumption, distribution, exchange, money, credit, 
rights of capital, rights of labour, all these questions multiplied over 
society ; a terrible steep. 

Outside of the political parties properly speaking:, another move- 
ment manifested itself. To the democratic fermentation, the philo- 
sophic fermentation responded. The 61ite felt disturbed as well as the 
multitude; otherwise, but as much. ' 

Thinkers were meditating, while the soil, that is to say, the people, 
traversed by the revolutionary currents, trembled beneath them with 
mysterious epileptic shocks. These thinkers, some isolated, others 
gathered into families and almost into communion, were fuming 
over social questions, peacefully, but profoundly ; impassible miners, 
who were quietly pushing their galleries into the depths of a vol- 
cano, scarcely disturbed by the sullen commotions and the half-seen 
glow of lava. 

This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of that agi- 
tated period. - 

These men left to political parties the qu^tion of rights, they 
busied themselves with the question of hai^in^- 



70S MISKRAnLKS 

'.riie well-being of man was what they wislunl to extract from so- 
ciety. 

'rht?y raised the material questanis, queslioiis of Jiyriculture, of 
indnslrv, ef commerce, alnaist to the digTiit V id a religion. In civil- 
isation such as it is const itnletl to small t*xii*nt l)y ( lod, to great by 
man, interests are coml)ine(h aggr&lt;‘gaieil, and ainalgamattsl in such 
a manner as to form actual hard rock, aect)nling jo a ilynaniic law 
patiently studied by the economists, thi»st‘ geologists of ])olitics. 

These men who grouped themselves under dillerent ajipellations, 
but wlio may all be designated by tlie gem^ric title of socialists, en- 
deavoured to inerce this rock and to make the living waters of hu- 
man felicity gusli forth from it. 

iMairn the &lt;juestion of the scatlt&gt;ld to the tpiestiou of war, their 
labours embraced everything. 'I'o the rights td’ man, ])roclaimed by 
the French Revolution, they a&lt;ltl(‘d the rights of woman and the 
rights of childhood. 

No one. will he astoni.dietl that, fnr various reasons, we do not 
here treat fimdamentally. from the tlieoretic ])oint td view, tlie ques- 
tions raised by socialisnn W’e limit onrst*lv&lt;‘s to iiulicating them. 

All the pnjfdems which the sncialist.s pn»pouuded, aside from the 
cosmogonic visions, dreams, aiul mj'sticism, may he reduced to two 
principal prolileins. 

First ])rohlein : 

To produce wealth. 

Second prolilem : 

To dtstrihute it. 

The first problem contains the (jUi*stiim t»f labnur. 

The second contains tlu,* ({ucslion id* waj’es. 

In the first problem the question is of tiu* em|)h»yment of force. 

In the second of the distnhutii»u of enjt wmeut. 

From the good em|)loyinenl &lt;d force n*-suhs jiuhlic ]iowia'. 

From the good distrihutii»n of enj(»yment results individual hap- 
piness. 

By good &lt;Iistrihulion, Wi* must nuderstaud not e&lt;|nal ilislrihiition, 
but equilahle distrilmiion. 11u* bight, st et|na!iiy is eqmty,^ 

From these two things etunliined, inildic power withoni, individual 
bapiniiess within, results sticial pnisperiiv. 

Social prosperity means, man hapi\v. i!u‘ citir,en free, the nation 
great. 

ICngland siilves tlu* first of these two prolihms, Slu* creates wealth 
wonderfully; slie disirihuies it badly. This solntitm, which is com* 
plete only on one sale* leads lier iiu‘vttah!y ii» these two extremes; 
monstrous opulence, monstrous misery. All the enpiyment tt) a few, 
all the privatiiin to the rest, that is to say, \o the people; privilege, 
exception, monopoly, feudality, S|)ringing from labour itself; a 
false and dangerous situation which founds |iiiblic power upon prF 



SAINT DENIS 709 

vate misery, which plants the grandeur of the state in the sufJering 
of the individual. A grandeur ill constituted, in which all the material 
elements are combined, and into which no moral element enters. 

Communism and agarian law think they have solved the second 
problem. They are mistaken. Their distribution kills production. 
Equal partition abolishes emulation. And consequently labour. It ia 
a distribution made by the butcher, who kills what he divides. It ia 
therefore impossible to stop at these professed solutions. To kill 
wealth is not to distribute it. 

The two problems must be solved together to be well solved. The 
two solutions must be combined and form but one. 

Solve the first only of the two problems, you will be Venice, you 
will be England. You will have like Venice an artificial power, or 
like England a material power ; you will be the evil rich man, you will 
perish by violence, as Venice died, or by bankruptcy, as England will 
fall, and the world will let you die and fall, because the world lets 
everything fall and die which is nothing but selfishness, everything 
which does not represent a virtue or an idea for the human race. 

It is of course understood that by these words, Venice, England, 
we designate not the people, but the social constructions ; the oli- 
garchies . iperimposed upon the nations, and not the nations them- 
selves. Th . nations always have our respect and our sympalhy. 
Venice, the people, will be reborn ; England, the aristocracy, will 
fall, but England, the nation, is immortal. This said, we proceed. 

Solve the two problems, encourage the rich, and protect die poor, 
suppress misery, put an end to the unjust speculation upon the weak 
by the strong, put a bridle upon the iniquitous j ealousy of him who is 
on the read, against him who has reached his end, adjust mathemati- 
cally and fraternally wages to labour, join gratuitous and obligatory 
instruction to the growth of childhood, and make science the basis 
of manhood, develop the intelligence while you occupy the arm, be 
at once a powerful people and a family of happy men, democratise 
property, not by abolishing it, but by universalising it, in such a way 
that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor, an easier 
thing than it is believed to be ; in two words, learn to produce wealth 
and learn to distribute it, and you shall have material grandeur and 
moral gra ndeur combined ; and you shall be worthy to call yourselves 
France. 

This, above and beyond a few sects which ran ^wild, is^ what 
socialism said; that is what it sought to realise; this is what it out- 
lined in men’s minds. 

Admirable efforts ! sacred attempts ! 

These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen 
necessity for the statesman to consult with the philosopher, confused 
evidences half seen, a new politics to create, accordant with the old 
world, and yet not too discoixlant with the ideal of the revolution ; a

FACTS FROM WHICH HISTORY SPRINGS, AND WHICH 
HISTORY IGNORES 

Towards the end of April everything was worse. The fermentation 
became a boiling. Since 1830 there had been here and there some 
little partial emeutes, quickly repressed, but again breaking out, 
signs of a vast underlying conflagration. Something terrible was 
brooding. Glimpses were caught of the lineaments, still indistinct 
and scarcely visible, of a possible revolution. France looked to Paris ; 
Paris looked to the Fauboui-g Saint Antoine. “ 

The Faubourg Saint Antoine sullenly warmed up, was beginning 
to boil. 

The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne, although the junction 
of the two epithets seems singular, applied to wine-shops, were 
serious and stormy. 

In them the simple existence of the government was brought in 
question. The men there publicty discussed whether it were the 
thing to fight or to remain quiet. There were back shops where an 
oath was administered to working-men, that they would be in the 
streets at the first cry of alarm, and '"that they would fight without 
counting the number of the enemy. The engagement once taken, 
a man seated in a corner of the wine-shop ''made a sonorous voice/' 
and said : "Fow understand it ! you have szvorn itT Sometimes they 
went upstairs into a closed room, and there scenes occurred which 
were almost masonic. Oaths were administered to the initiated to 
render service to them as they would to their own f athers. That was 
the formula. * 

In the lower rooms they read "subversive" i^mpblets. They pelted 
the government, says a secret report of the times. 

Such words as these were heard, — 'T don^t know the names of the 
chiefs. As for us, we shall only know the day two hours beforehand/^ 
A working-man said ; ^'There are three hundred of us, let us put in 
ten sous each, that will make a hundred and fifty francs to manu-&gt; 
facture powder and ball/* Another said: "J don^i ask six months, ! 
don/t ask two.. In less than a fortnight we shall meet the government 
face to face. With twenty'- five thousand men we esm make a stand.** 
Anodaer said : "/ don*t gojo bed, because I am making cartridges all 
night/* From time to time^, men "like bourgeois,, and: in fin^ coats" 
came, "causing eraharravSsmemt/' and having the air "of command/' 
gave agrip of the hand totheimst and went away. They' 



712 LES MIsflRABLES 

never stayed more than ten minutes. Signilicant words were ex- 
changed in a low voice: “The plot is ripe, the thing is complete." 
“This was buzzed by all who were there,” to bon-ow the vety ex- 
pression of one of the participants. The exaltation was such, that 
one day, in a public wine-shop, a working-man exclaimed : We’ have 
no arms! One of his comrades answered; The soldiers have! thus 
parodying, without suspecting it, Bonaparte’s proclamation to the 
army of Italy. “When they_havc_ anything more secret,” adds a re- 
port, “they do not communicate it in those places.” One can hardly 
comprehend what they could conccal after saying what they did. 

The meetings were sometimes periodical. At some, there were 
never more than eight or ten, and always the same persons. In 
others, anybody who chose entered, and the room was so full tliat 
they were forced to stand. Some were there from enthusiasm and 
passion ; others because it was on their way to their work. As in the 
time of the revolution, there were in these wine-shops some female 
patriots, who embraced the new-comers. 

Other expressive facts came to light. 

A man entered a shop, drank, and went out, saying: “Wine- 
merchant, what is due, the revolution will pay." 

At a wine-shop ojjjiosite the l^ue de Cliaronna revolutionary of- 
ficers were elected, 'riic ballots were gathered in ca])s. 

Some working-men met at a fencing-master’s, who gave lessons 
in the Rue de Cotte. There was a trophy of anus there, formed of 
wooden sword.s, canes, clubs, and foils. ( )ne (lay they took the but- 
tons off the foils. A working-man .said: “IVe 'are twenty-five; but 
they don’t count on me, became they look upon me as a machine.” 
This machine was afterwards Quenisset. 

All the little thing.s which were prciucditatcd, gradually acquired 
some strange notoriety. A wom.an sweeping her door-step said to 
another woman ; For a long time they have been hard at work mak- 
ing cartridges. Proclam.ations were read in the oiien street, addressed 
to the National Cluards of the Dcptirtments. One of these proclama- 
tions was signed : Biirtot, wine-merchant. 

One day at a liquor-dealer’s door in the Twnoir market, a man with 
a heavy beard and an Italian accent mounted on a lilock and read 
aloud a singular writing which seemed to emanate from a secret 
power. Groups formed alwut him and api»lauded. The passages 
which stirred the crowd most were eatiglit and noted down. . . Our 
doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations are torn down our 
posters are watched and thrown into prison. . . . The recent fall 
in cottons lias converted many niodenttes. . . " “The future of the 
peoples i.s being worked out in our obscure ranks.” . . Behold the 
statement of the matter: action or reaction, revolution or counter- 
revolution. Ii'tw, in our times, there is no belief longer in inertia 
or m immobility. For the people or against the people, that is the 



SAINTDENIS 713" 

question. There is no other.’' . The day that we no longer suit 
you, crush us, but until then help us to go forward.” All this in broad 
day. 

Other acts, bolder still, w-ere suspected by the people on account of 
their very boldness. On the 4th of April, 1832, a passer-by mounted 
the block at the corner of the Rue Sainte Marguerite, and cried : I 
am a Babouvist! But under Babeuf the people scented Gisquet. 

Among other things, this man said : 

‘‘Down with property ! The opposition of the left are cowards and 
traitors. When they want to be right, they preach revolution. They 
are democrats that they may not be beaten, and ro^’-alists that they 
may not fight. The republicans are feathered beasts. Distrust the re^ 
publicans, citizen labourers.” 

“Silence, citizen spy !” cried a working-man. 

This put an end to the discourse. 

Mysterious incidents occurred. 

At nightfall, a working-man met “a well-dressed man” near fhe 
canal, who said to him : “Where are you going, citizen ?” “Mon- 
sieur,” said the working-man, “I have not the honour of knowing 
you.” “I know you very well.” And the man added : “Don’t be afraid. 
I am the officer of the Committee. They are suspicious that you are 
not very sure. You know that if you reveal anything, we have an eye 
upon you.” Then he gave the working-man a grip of the hand and 
went away, saying : “We shall meet again soon.” 

The police, on the scout, overheard, not merely in the wine-shops, 
but in the street, singular dialogues : “Get yourself admitted very 
quick,” said a weaver to a cabinet-maker. 

“Why?” 

“There is going to be some shooting.” 

Two passers in rags exchanged these remarkable phrases, big 
with apparent Jacquerie. 

“Who governs us?” 

“Monsieur Philippe.” 

“No, it’s the bourgeoisie.” 

You would be mistaken if you supposed that we used the word 
Jacquerie in bad part. The Jacques were the poor. 

Another time, two men were heard passing by, one of whom said 
to the other : “We have a good plan of attack.” 

Of a private conversation between four men crouching in a ditch 
at the fork of the road by the Barriere du Trone, there was caught 
only this : 

‘Air that is possible will be done that he may promenade in Paris 
no more.” 

Who was hef Threatening obscurity. 

“The principal chiefs,” as they said in the Faubourg, kept out of 
sight. They were believed to meet to concert together, in a wine-

The honest bourgeois who finally came into possession of this 
list knew its signification. It appeared that this list gave the com- 
plete nomenclature of the sections of the Fourth Arrondissement 
of the Society of the Rights of Man, with the names and residences 
of the chiefs of sections. At this day, when all these facts then un- 
known arc matter of history only, they can be published. It should 
be added that the foundation of the society of the Rights of Man 
seems to have been posterior to the time when this paper was found. 
Perhaps it was merely a draft. _ ... 

Meaitwhile, after rumours and speeches, after written indications, 
material facts began to leak out. 

In the Rue Popincourt, at an old curiosity shop, there were seized 
in a bureau drawer seven sheets of grey paper all evenly folded in 
quarto ; these sheets inclosed twenty-six squares of the same grey 
paper folded in the form of cartridges, and a card upon which was 
written : ' 

Saltpetre, 12 ounces. 

Sulphur, 2 ounces. 

Cliarcoal, 2 ounces and a half. 

Water, 2 ounces. 

The official report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled 
a strong odour of powder. _ 

A mason going home, after his day’s work, forgot a little package 
ori a bench near the Bridge of Austerlitz. This package was carried 
to the guard-house. It was opened and disclosed two printed dia- 
logues, signed LahauHtre, a song entitled ; Working-men, associate, 
and a tin box full of cartridges. ^ 

A working-man, drinking with a comrade, made him put his hand 
on him to see how warm he was ; the other felt a pistol under his

a card-table befon^ his door. ( )n(‘ ttn&gt;k a pi&gt;tol f n»m under bis blouse

perceived that the perspiration frum his breast liad communicated 
fiome moisture U\ the powder, Ih* |»rimed the pisttd, and adtled some 
powder to that which was already in the pan. Tluni the two men 
went away. 

A man nanu‘d (lallais. afnu'warils killed in the hue lUmibourg

and twenty-four gnndlints at Imme. 

The government received wurd one day that arms had just been 
distributed in the Faubourg and two Imndtaal thousand cartridges. 
The week afterwards thirty thcaisand cainidgt's were distributed. 
A remarkable thing, tlw ptdice ron!&lt;! not sei/e mie. An intercejited

where. Like those membranes which are born of certain inflamma- 
tions and formed in the human body, the network of the secret so- 
cities began to spread over the country. From the association of the 
Friends of the People, public and secret at the same time, sprang 
the society of the Rights of Man, which dated one of its orders of 
the day thus : Pluvidse, year 40 of the Republican Era, which wa? 
to survive even the decrees of the Court of Assizes pronouncing it£. 
dissolution, and which had no hesitation in giving its -sections such 
significant names as these : 

The Pikes.

21st January, 

The Beggars 

The Society of the Rights of Man produced the Society of Ac- 
tion. These were the more impatient who left it and ran forward. 
Other associations sought to recruit from the large mother societies. 
The sectionaries complained of being pestered by this. Thus arose 
The Gallic Society and the Organising Committee of the Munici- 
palities. Thus the associations for the Freedom of the Press, for In- 
dividual Freedom, for the Instruction of the People, against Direct 
Taxes. Then the society of the Equalitist Working-men which di- 
vided into three fractions, the Equalitists, the Communists and the 
Reformers. Then the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort with 
a military organisation, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by 
a sergeant, twenty by a second lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; 
there were never more than five hundred men who knew each other. 
A creation in which precaution was combined with boldness, and 
which seems marked with the genius of Venice. The central com- 
mittee, which was the head, had two arms, the Society of Action and 
the Army of the Bastilles. A legitimist association, the Chevaliers 
of Fidelity, moved among these republican affiliations. But it was 
denounced and repudiated. 

The Parisian societies ramified into the principal cities. Lyons, 
Nantes, Lisle, and Marseilles had their Society of the Rights of 
Man, the Carbonari, the Free Men. Aix had a revolutionary society 
which was called the Cougourde. We have already pronounced this 
word. 

At Paris the Faubourg Saint Marceau was hardly less noisy than 
the Faubourg Saint Antoine, and the schools not less excited than 
the Faubourgs. A cafe in the Rue St. Hyacinthe, and the drinking 
and smoking room of the Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurin St. 
Jacques, served as rallying places for the students. The Society of

the Friends of the ABC, affiliated with the Mutualists of Ano-ers 
and with the Cougourde of Aix, met, as we have seen, at the Cafe 
Musain. These same young people also gathered, as we have said 
in a restaurant wine-shop near the Rue Mondctour which was called 
Corinthe. These meetings were secret, others were as public as pos- 
sible, and we may judge of their boldness by this fragment at an in- 
terrogatory during one of the subsequent trials : ‘‘Where was this 
meeting held ?” “Rue de la Paix.” “In wliose house ?’’ “In the street.” 
“What sections were there ?” “But one.” “Which one ?” “The Man- 
uel section." “Who was the chief ?” “J.” “You are too young to have 
formed alone the grave resolution of attacking the government 
Whence came your instructions ?” “ Im-oiii the central committee.” ' 

The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was 
proved afterwards by the movements of Ik'ford, Lunevi'lle. and 
Epinal. They counted on the llfty-second regiment, the fifth, the 
eighth, the thirty-seventh, :ind the twentieth light. In Burgundy 
and in the cities of the South the tree of Liberty plantedri'hat 
is to say, a pole surmounted by a red cap. 

Such was the situation. 

This situation was, as we .sakl in the beginning, rendered tangible 
and emphatic by the Faubourg Saint .\ntoim; mt ire than by any other 
portion of the population. 'I'licre was tlu; stitch in the side,' 

This old Faubourg, populous as an ant-hill, indusfriou.s, coura- 
geous, and choleric as a hive, was thrilling with the expectation and 
the desire for a commotion, liviTything was in agitation, and yet 
labour was not interrupted on that account. Nothing can give an 
idea of that vivid yet dark phase of affairs, Tliere are in that Fau- 
bourg bitter distresses hidden under garret roofs ; there are there 
iilso_ ardent and rare intelligencies. And it is &lt;‘siH‘cia!ly in reference 
&lt;0 distre^ss and intelligence that it is «!:uigermi.s for extremes to meet. 

Phe hiinbouig Satnt Anfotne had .still other caus(*s of excitement 
for it felt the rebound of the commercial crises, of the failures the 
strikes, and .stoppages, inherent in great political disturbances In 
time of revolution misery i.s at once cause ami effect. The blow 
which it strikes returns upon itself. 'I'his {lopulaiion, full of proud 
Virtue, filled with latent culonc to tlu* point, always rcEdy 

for an armed conte.st, prompt to explocl&lt;., irritated, deep, mined 
seetned only waiting for the fall of a .spark. Whenever eertain sparks' 
are floating over the horiaon, driven by the wind of events, we cannot 
but think of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and the terrible chance 
which Im placed that powder-mill of stilTerings and idea.s at the 
gates of Pans. 

The wine-shops of the Fattbourff Anfom^, more than once res 
ferredto in the preceding sketch, have a notoriety which is historic, 
in times of trouble their words are more intoxicating than their 
wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an odour of the future circu- 



SAINT DENIS 719 

lates in them, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. The winershops 
of the Faubourg Antoine resemble those taverns of Mount Aven- 
tine, over the Sybil’s cave, and communicating with the deep and 
sacred afflatus ; taverns whose tables were almost tripods, and where 
men drank what Ennius calls the sibylline wine. 

The Fauborg Saint Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolution- 
ary agitation makes fissures in it through which flows popular sover- 
eignty. This sovereignty may do harm ; it makes mistakes like every- 
thing else; but, even when led astray, it is still grand. We inay say 
of it as of the blind Cyclops, Ingens. 

In ’93, according as the idea which was afloat was good or bad, 
according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there 
came from the Faubourg Saint Antoine sometimes savage legions, 
sometimes heroic bands. 

Savage. We must explain this word. What was the aim of those 
bristling men who in the demiurgic days of revolutionary chaos, 
ragged, howling, wild, with tomahawk raised, and pike aloft, rushed 
over old overturned Paris ? They desired the end of oppressions, the 
end of tyrannies, the end of the sword, labour for man, instruction 
for children, social gentleness for woman, liberty, equality, fra- 
ternity, bread for all, ideas for all. The Edenisation of the world, 
Progress ; and this holy, good, and gentle thing, progress, pushed to 
the wall and beside themselves, they demanded, terrible, half naked, 
a club in their grasp, and a roar in their mouth. They were savages, 
yes ; but the savages of civilisation. 

They proclaime4 the right furiously ; they desired, were it through 
fear and trembling, to force the human race into paradise. They 
seemed barbarians, and they were saviours. With the mask of night 
they demanded the light. 

In contrast with these men, wild, we admit, and terrible, |)ut wild 
and terrible for the good, there are other men, smiling, embroidered, 
gilded, beribboned, bestarred, in silk stockings, in white feathers,, in 
yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, leaning upon a velvet table 
by the corner of a marble mantel, softly insist upon the maintenance 
and the preservation of the past, the middle ages, divine right, 
fanaticism, ignorance, slavery, the death penalty, and war, glorify- 
ing politely and in mild tones the sabre, the stake, and the scaffold. 

' As for us, if we were compelled to choose between the barbarians of^ 
civilisation, and the civilisees of barbarism, we would choose th« 
barbarians. 

But, thanks to heaven, other choice is possible. No abrupt fall is 
necessary, forward more than backward. Neither despotism, nor 
terrorism. We desire progress with gentle slope. 

God provides for this. The smoothing of acclivities is the whola 
policy of God.

ENJOLRAS AND HIS I-IEUTENANTS 

Not far from this period, EnjorLis, in view of possible events tool? 
a sort of mysterious account of stock. 

All were in conventicle at the Cafe iMusain. 

Enjorlas said, mingling willi his words a few semi-enigmatic but 
signilicant metaphors. 

“It is well to know where we are and on whom we can rely. It we 
desire fighting men, we must make them. 1 lave the wherewith to 
strike. That can do no harm. Travellers have a better chance of catch- 
ing a thrust of a horn when there are hulls in the road than when 
there are none. I,et us then take a little account of the herd. How 
many are there of us ? We cannot pul this work oil till to-morTow. 
Revolutionists ought always to he nvuly ; progress has no time to 
lose. Let us not trust to the moment. l..et’ns nut Ite taken unprepared.

and feel the pulse of the .Medical .School. Bos.sitel will make a little 
tour in the Palace of Justice and chat with the yoimg lawyers. I will 
take charge of tlie Cougourdcs.^ 

“Then it is all arranged," .said Oairfcvrac. 

“No.” 

“What niore is there then r" 

“A very' important thing.” 

“What is it ?” imiuired Comliefcrrc. 

‘Mhe Barriere tlu IMaiiie,” answertul Eiijolras, 

^ Knjolra.s remained a moment, as it were, ahsttrlKHl in his reflec- 
tions, then resumed : 

‘At the_ Barriere tlu Maine there are marble eutters, painters, 
as.sistants m sculptors’ .slutlios. It is an enthusiastic f.nmily, hut sub- 
ject to chills. I do not know wliat has ailetl them for some lime. They 
are thmkmg of other things. They are fading out. They spend their 
time in flaying dominoes. SomebtHiy nmst go and talk to them a lit-

whole he is good, but he does not come any more. I must have some- 
body for the Barriere tlu Maine. 1 teve nolxwly left,” 



SAINT DENIS 72 J' 

“I,” said Grantaire, “I am here.” 

“You?” 

J J3 

* ‘‘You to indoctrinate republicans ! you, to warm up, in the name 
of principles, hearts that have grown cold!'’ ^ 

“Why not ?" 

“Is it possible that you can be good for anything ?" 

“Yes, I have a vague ambition for it,” said Grantaire. 

“You don't believe in anything.” 

“I believe in you.” 

“Grantaire, do you want to do me a service ?” 

“Anything. Polish your boots.” 

“Well, don't meddle with our affairs. Sleep off your bitters.” 

“You are an ingrate, Enjorlas.” 

“You would be a fine man to go to the Barriere du Maine 1 you 
would be capable of it 1” 

“I am capable of going down the Rue des Gres, of crossing the 
Place Saint Michel, of striking off through the Rue Monsieur le 
Prince, of taking the Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmes, 
of turning into the Rue d'Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche 
Midi, of leaving behind me the Conseil de Guerre, of hurrying 
through the Rue des Vieilles Tuileries, of striding through the 
Boulevard, of following the Chaussee du Maine, of crossing over 
the Barriere, and of entering Richefeu's. I am capable of that. My 
shoes are capable of it.” 

“Do you know anything about these comrades at Richefeu's ?” 

“Not much. We are on good terms, though.” 

“What will you say to them ?” 

“I will talk to them about Robespierre, faith. About Dantoii, about 
principles.” 

“You!” 

“I.. But you don't do me justice. When I am about it, I am terrible, 
I have read Prudhomme, I know the Contrat Social, I know my 
Constitution of the year Two by heart. ‘The Liberty of the citizen 
ends where the Liberty of another citizen begins.' Do you take me 
for a brute? I have an old assignat in my drawer. The Rights of 
Man, the sovereignty of the people, zounds ! I am even a little of a 
Hebertist. I can repeat, for six hours at a time, watch in hand, superb 
things.?' 

“Be seriotls,” said Enjolras. 

“I am savage,” answered Grantaire. 

Enjolras thought for a few seconds, and made the gesture of a 
man who forms his resolution. 

“Grantaire,” said he gravely, “I consent to try you. You shall go 
to the Barriere du Maine.” ^ 

Grantaire lived in a furnished room quite near the Cafe Musian. 



722 .1. E S M I S E R A B L S 

He went out, and came back in live miiuites. He had been home to 
put on a Robespierre waistcoat. 

'*Red,” said he as he came in, looking straight at Enjolras. 

Then, with the flat of his huge hand, lie smoothed the two scarlet 
points of his waistcoat over his breast. 

And, approaching Enjolras, he whispered in his ear: 

“Set your mind at ease.'* 

He jammed down his hat, resolutely, and went out. 

A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Cafe Musain 
was deserted. All the Friends of the A i&gt; C liad gone, each his own 
way, to their business. Enjolras, who had reserved the Cougourde 
for himself, went out last. 

Those of the Courgonrde of A\x who were at I'^aris met at that 
time on the Plain of Jssy, in one of the abandoned quarries so nu- 
merous on that side of Paris. 

Enjolras, on his way towards this jilace of rendezvous, passed the 
situation in review. The gravity of events was plainly visible. When 
events, premonitory of some latent social malady, are moving 
heavily along, the least complication stoi&gt;s tliem ancf shackles them. 
A phenomenon whence come overthrows and new births. Enjolras 
caught glimpses of a luminous uprising under the dark* skirts of 
the future. Who knows ? the moment was perhaps approaching. The 
people seizing their rights again, what a beaut if til spectacle! the 
Revolution majestically resuming possession of I'Vance, and saying 
to the world : to be contlniKHl to-morrow ! ]£njf&gt;lras was content The 
furnace was heating. He had, at that very instant, a powder-train 
of friends extended over Paris. He was composing in his thoughts, 
with the philosophic and penetrating eloquence of Combeferre, the 
•cosmopolitan enthusiasm of Feuilly, G:ntrfeyrac*s animation, 'Sa- 
hoiels IiUighter, Jean Proiivaires melancholy, July's science, and 
Bos.suet*s sarcasms, a sort of^eltniric sjark takiiig lire in all directions 
at once. All in the work. Snrelv, the result woubf answer to the 
effort. This was well. 11iis led him to think of Grantaire. “Stop,” 
said he tojvimself, “the Barricre du Maine hardly takes me out of 
my way. Suppose I go as far as kiclu*f&lt;m’s ? Let us get a glimpse of 
what Grantaire is doing, and how he is getting along.” 

^ One o'clock sounded from the In,*! fry of Vaugirard when En- 
jolras reached the kichef(?u smoking-room. He inish(*d open the 
door, went in, folded his arms, letting the door swing to sn'that it 
hit Ins shoulders, and looked into tlie room full of tables, men, and 
smoke. 

A voice was ringing out in the mist, sharply answered by another 
voice. It was Grantaire talking witlt an ariversary whom he had 
found. 

Grantaire was seated, opposite another figure, at a table of vSaint 
Anne marble strewed with bran, and dotted with dominoes : he was

“Six.”

THE liTELW OK THE [,AUK 

Marius had seen tlie uncxpcolcil (Ii'miiienient of the ambuscade 
upon the track of which he liad put Javcrt ; hut hardly had Javert 
left the old ruin, carryiiiff away liis ]&gt;ris( mers in three coaches, when 
Marius also slipijcd out of the house. It wa.s only nine o’clock' in the 
evening'. Marius w(‘nt to Courfeyrac’s. fourfeyrac was no longer 
the imperturbable inhahilant of the Latin Ouarter; he liad gone*’ to 
live in the Rue de la V(;rrerie “for political reasons this quarter 
was one of those in which the insurrection was fond of installing it- 
self in those days. Marius said to Courfeynic : “1 have, conic to sleep 
with you.” Courfeyrac drew a inattress'from his bed, where there 
were two, laid it on the iloor, .and said: “There you arc.’' 

'J'hc ne.xt (hqv, by seviai o’clock in the inorning.’.Marius went back 
to the tenement, paid his rent, and wli.at was due to Ma’am Bougon, 
had his liooks, lied, table, Intre.'iu, and his two chairs loaded upon a 
hand-tait, and went oiT without leaving his arUlress, so that when 
Javert came, hack in the forenoon to (|uest ion Marins about the events, 
of the evening, he fotind otily Ma’am Bougon, who answered him, 
moved !” 

Ma’am Bougon was convinnMl that Marius w;is somehow an ac- 
complice of the robbers .sei/eil the iiiglil before. “Who would have 
thought .so?” she i‘xclaimed among the porfressics of the quarter, “a 
young man wlio had .so nnu-li the apiiearanee of a girl !" 

Marius had two reasons for his prompt removVil. 'I'he first was, 
that he now had a horror of thtil house, where he hail .seen, so near 
at hand, and in all its most nquilsive and most teroeious develop- 
ment, a .social deformity perhaps still more hideous than the evil 
nch nitUi : the evil p(jnr, 1 he stoumI Wds, ihat he clitl not wish to 
ugxm\ in the trial which wonlt! pnihahlv ftilhiw, and lie hvomht 
forward to te.stify against 'riumardier. 

Javert thought that the young man, whose* name he htid not re- 
tained, hail lieeii frightened and had escaped, or, perhaiis, had not 
even returned home at the lime of the amhu.scade: still he made 
some effort to find Iiini, hut he did not .succeed.

ante-rooms of the court, that Thenardier was in solitary confine- 
ment. Every Monday Marius sent to the clerk of La Force five 
francs for Thaiardier. 

Marius, having now no money, borrowed the five francs of Cour- 
feyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had borrowed money. 
This periodical five francs was a double enigma, to Courfeyrac who 
furnished them, and to Thenardier who received them. ^‘To whom 
can it go?'’ thought Courfeyrac. ‘Where can it come from?” The- 
nardier asked himself. 

Marius, moreover, was in sore affliction. Everything had relapsed 
into darkness. He no longer saw anything before him ; his life was 
’ again plunged into that mystery in which he had been blindly grop- 
ing. Fie had for a moment seen close at hand in that obscurity, the 
young girl whom he loved, the old man who seemed her father, these 
unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in 
this world ; and at the moment he had thought to hold them fast, 
a breath had swept all those shadows away. Not a spark of certainty 
or truth had escaped even from that most fearful shock. No conjec- 
ture was possible. He knew not even the name which he had thought 
he knew. Certainly it was no longer Ursula. And the Lark was a 
nickname. And what should he think of the old man ? Was he really 
hiding f I'om the police ? The white-haired working-man who Marius 
had met in the neighbourhood of the Invalides recurred to his mind. 
It now became probable that that working-man and M. Leblanc were 
the same man. He disguised himself then ? This man had heroic sides, 
and equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help ? why had he 
escaped? was he, yes or no, the father of the young girl? Finally, 
was he really the man whom Thenardier thought he recognised ? 
Could Thenardier have been mistaken ? So many problems without 
issue. All this, it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms 
of the young girl of the Luxembourg. Bitter wretchedness ; Marius 
had a passion in his heart, and night over his eyes. He was pushed, 
he was drawn, and he could not stir. All had vanished, except love. 
Even of love, he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. 
Ordinarily, this flame which consumes us, illumines us also a little, 
and sheds some useful light without. Those vague promptings of 
passion, Marius no longer even heard. Never did he say to himself : 
Suppose I go there? Suppose I try this? She whom he could no 
longer call Ursula was evidently somewhere ; nothing indicated to 
Marius the direction in which he must seek for her. His whole life 
was now resumed in two words : an absolute uncertainty in an im- 
penetrable mist. To see her again. Her; he aspired to this contin- 
ually ; he hoped for it no longer. 

To crown all, want returned. He felt close upon him, behind him^, 
that icy breath. During all these torments, and now for a long time, 
he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than

Uisconliniicil laliour ; it is haiut lost. A luihit easy to abandon, difficult 
to resume. 

A certain amcmnt of reverie is guod, like a narcotic in discreet 
doses. It .sootlies the fever, .sometimes hip,!!, of the lirain at work 
and itroduees in the mind a .sot i and f re_sh vap( mr whieli corrects the 
too angular contours of pure tliouglit, tills up the gaiis .and intervals 
here and there, hiinls them together, and hhmt.s the .sharp corners of 
ideas. But too innch reverie suhinerges .and drowns. Woe to the 
brain-worker who allows himself to f.all laitirely frutn thought into 
reverie! lie tliinks that he .shall rise again ea.sijy, .and he says that, 
after all, it is the same thing. An error ! _ ’ 

Thought is the lahour of the iiilelleet, reverie is its pleasure. To 
replace tliought hy reverie is to coiifound jinison with jumrishment. 

M.arius, we rememher, had liegun in this wav. !’.as,sion super- 
vened, and had at last precijiit.ated him into hotlnmless and aimkss 
chimeras. One no longer goes out of the hon.se e.scept to w;ilk and 
dream. Sluggish hirtli. A ttimiilliinu.s ;nui .stagnant gulf. And, as 
work liiminishes, ncia’ssities iiiereasc. This is llie law. jVlan, in the 
dreamy state, is naturally inawiigal and hiMiriotis ; the relaxed mind 
cannot lead a .severe life. Then; is, in this w.ay of living, .some good 
mingled with the. evil, for if the sufieiiiiig he fatal, the generosity 
i.s witole.some .aiitl good. But the poor- man who is generous and

well a.H the weakest and the most vicious, and which k'jteis to one of 
the.se two pits, .suicide or crime. 

By continually going out fur reverie, there conie.s a day when you 
go tt&gt; tlirow ytturself into the water. 

The t!xci;.ss of reverie pnn!uee.s men like Ivscousse and Lebras. 

Marius w;is descending this .slope witli slow .steps, his eyc.s fixed 
upon her whom lie saw no more. What we have hert* written seems 
strange, and still it is true. The lueniory of an altsrnt being grows 
bright in the tiarkness of the heart ; the more it has disapiieared the 
more nidiant it is ; the «!esp.niriiig ami gloomy smtl .sees that light in 
its horizon ; star of the interior night. She, this was all t he thought of 
Marius, hie dreamed of nothhig else ; he ielt eoiif usedly thttt his old 
otat w.as becoming .an inipossiide cotit .and tliat liis new coat was be- 
ettming ,au old coat, tlmt hi.s .sliiris were wi;aritig tmt, that his hat 
was wearing out, that his boots were weiiriiig out, that is to say, that 
his life wms wearing out, and he said to himself, “if I could only see 
her again h'hrc J die,” 

A single sweet idc.a remained to him, that she had loved him, that 
her eyes had tohl liim so. that .she did not know his name bttt that 
^ she knew liis soul, and that, perhaps, where she w.is, whatever that 
mysterious place might tie, she loved him still. Who knows but she

was dreaming of him as he was dreaming of her? Sometimes in the 
inexplicable hours, such as every heart has which loves, having rea- 
sons for sorrow only, yet feeling nevertheless a vague thrill of joy, 
he said to himself : It is her thoughts which come to me ! Then he 
added, my thoughts reach her also, perhaps ! 

This illusion, at which he shook his head the moment afterwards, 
succeeded notwithstanding in casting some ray into his soul, which 
occasionally resembled hope. From time to time, especially at that 
evening hour which saddens dreamers most of all, he dropped upon 
a quire of paper, which he devoted to that purpose, the purest, the 
most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries with which love filled 
his brain. He called that "'writing to her/^ 

We must not suppose that his reason was disordered. Quite the 
contrary. He had lost the capability of work, and of moving firmly 
towards a definite end, but he was more clear-sighted and correct 
than ever. Marius saw, in a calm and real light, although a singular 
one, what was going on under his eyes, even the most indifferent 
facts of men ; he said the right word about everything with a sort 
of honest languor and candid disinterestedness. His judgment, al- 
most detached from hope, soared and floated aloft. 

In this situation of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived 
him, and he saw at every moment the bottom of life, humanity, and 
destiny. Happy, even in anguish, is he to whom God has given a soul 
worthy of love and of grief ! He who has not seen the things of this 
world, and the hearts of men by this double light, has seen nothing, 
and knows nothing of the truth. 

The soul which loves and which suffers is in the sublime state. 

The days passed, however, one after another, and there was noth- 
ing new. It seemed to him, merely, that the dreary space which re- 
mained for him to run through was contracting with every instant. 
He thought that he already saw distinctly the brink of the bottomless 
precipice. 

"What !"' he repeated to himself, "shall I never see her again be-

If you go up the Rue Saint Jacques, leave the barriere at your 
side, and follow the old interior boulevard to the left for some dis- 
tance, you come to the Rue de la Sante, then La Glapiere, and, a lit- 
tle before reaching the small stream of the Gobelins, you find a sort 
of field, which is, in the long and monotonous circuit of the boule- 
vards of Paris, the only spot where Ruysdael would be tempted to 
sit down. 

That indescribable something from which grace springs is there, 
a green meadow crossed by tight drawn ropes, on which rags are 
drying in the wind, an old market-garden farmhouse built in the 
time of Louis XIII., with its laf^ge roof grotesquely pierced with 
dormer windows, broken palisade fences, a small pond between the

he had changed into vapour, he had glided out of the handcuffs, he 
had slipped through the cracks of the carriage, the fiacre was lealcy, 
and had fled ; nothing could be said, save that on reaching the prison 
there was no Claquesous. There were either fairies or police in the 
matter. Had Claquesous melted away into the darkness like a snow- 
flake in the water ? Was there some secret connivance of the officers ? 
Did this man belong to the double enigma of disorder and of order ? 
Was he concentric with infraction and with repression ? Had this 
sphinx forepaws in crime and hind-paws in authority? Javert in no 
wise accepted these combinations, and his hair rose on end in view 
of such an exposure ; but his squad contained other inspectors be- 
sides himself, more deeply initiated, perliaps, than himself, although 
his subordinates, in the secrets of the prefecture, and Claquesous 
was so great a scoundrel that he might be a very good officer. To be 
on such intimate juggling relations with darkness is excellent for 
brigandage and admirable for the police. There are such two-edged 
rascals. However it might be, Claquesous was lost, and was not 
found again. Javert appeared more irritated than astonished at it. 

As to Marius, “that dolt of a lawyer,” who was “probably fright- 
ened,” and whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert cared little 
for him. Besides he was a lawyer, they are always found again. But 
was he a lawyer merely ? 

The trial commenced. 

The police judge thought it desirable not to put one of the men of 
the Patron-Minette band into solitary confinement, hoping for some 
blabbing. This was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue du Petit 
Banquier. He was left in the Charlemagne court, and the watchmen 
kept their eyes upon him. 

This name, Brujon, is one of the traditions of La Force. In the 
hideous court called the Batiment Neuf, which the administration 
named Court Saint Bernard, and which the I'obbers named La Fosse 
aux Lions, upon that wall covered with filth and with mould, which 
rises on the left to the height of the roofs, near an old rusty iron 
door which leads into the former chapel of the ducal hotel of La 
Force, now become a dormitory for brigands, a dozen years ago 
there could still be seen a sort of bastille coarsely cut in the stone 
with a nail, and below it this signature : 

BRUJON, 1811. 

The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832. 

This last, of whom only a glimpse was caught in the Gorbeau am- 
buscade, was a sprightly young fellow, very cunning and very adroit, 
with a flurried and plaintive appearance. It was on account of this 
flurried air that the judge had selected him, thinking that h'” would 
be of more use in the Charlemagne court than in « aolitarv cell.

Brujon seemed stupefied by the prison. 1U‘ was sometimes s^en 
whole hours in the Chari ema,t;'ne court, stan&lt;Iin|L!;' near the sutler’s 
window, and starinj^ like an idiot at that dirty list of prices of sup- 
plies which began with : garlic, 02 and taided wiili : cigars, 

cinq centimes. Or instead, he would ]»ass his time in trembling and 
making his teeth chatter, saying that ht‘ had a fin'cr, and int|uiring 
if one of the twenty-eight beds in the fevtn* waial was ntJl vacant. 

Suddenly, al»ont the secoml fortnight in l*Vhruary, 1832, it was 
discovi^red tliat Brujon, tliat sleepy ft‘lliAV, had sent ont, through 
the agents of the house, not in ]us tuvn nanie, hut in the name of 
three, of his comrades, tliree difTerent commissions, which had cost 
him in all fifty sous, a tremendous extnmse wliicli attracted the at- 
tention of the prison brigadier. 

He iiKiuiretl into it, niul by consulting tlie i&gt;rice list of commis- 
sions hung np in the convicts* waiting-room, he ftmnd that tlie fifty 
sous were macle up thus: three commissions; one to tlie Pantheon, 
ten sotis ; one to the Val de ( Jraee, iiftei'U sous ; and one to the Bar- 
riere de Crenelle, twenty-dive sons. 'This Wv'is the dearest of the 
whole list. Now tlie Paui!u‘on. tht‘ \*a! de (irace, and the Rarriere 
de Cfi'enelle hnp[H‘ned io lie the resi&lt;!ences of three of tlie most

fixed the ey&lt;‘.s of the jnilice. They ilantglit tliey divined that these

three prowlers, and thmiglit they had foiled Ihmjon^s machination 
whatever it was. 

Al)out a wet*k after these fneasnn*s were taken, one night, a watch-

SAINT DENIS 73f 

It is certain, however, that the next day postillion’’ was thrown 
from the Charlemagne cSurt into the Fosse aux Lions, over the five- 
story building which separates the two courts. 

Prisoners call a ball of bread artistically kneaded, which is sent 
into Ireland, that is to say, over the roof of a prison, from one court 
to the other, a postillion. Etymology: over England; from one 
county to the other ; into Ireland. This ball falls in the court. He who 
picks it up opens it, and finds a letter in it addressed to some prisoner 
iii the court. If it be a convict who finds it, he hands the letter to its 
destination ; if it be a warden, or one of those secretly bribed prison- 
ers who are called sheep in the prisons and foxes in the galleys, the 
letter is carried to the office and delivered to the police. 

This time the postillion reached its address, although he for whom 
the message was destined was then in solitary. Its recipient was none 
other than Babet, one of the four heads of Patron Minette. 

The postillion contained a paper rolled up, on which there were 
only these two lines : 

“Babet, there is an affair on hand in the Rue Plumet. A grating 
in a garden.” 

This was the thing that Brujon had written in the night. 

In spite of spies, both male and female, Babet found means to send 
the letter from La Force to La Salpetriere to ''a friend” of his who 
was shut up there. This gii‘1 in her tui*n transmitted the letter to 
another whom she knew, named Magnon, who was closely watched 
by the police, but not yet arrested. This Magnotv, whose name the 
reader has already seen, had some relations with the Thenardiers 
which will be related hereafter, and could, by going to see Eponine, 
serve as a briclge between La Salpetriere and Les Madelonnettes- 

It happened just at that very moment, the proofs in the prosecu- 
tion of Thenardier failing in regard to his daughters, that Eponine 
and Axelma were released. 

When Eponine came out, Magnon, who was watching for her at 
the door of I-es Ma&lt;Ielonnettes, handed her Brujon’s note to Babet, 
charging her to find out about the affair. 

Eponine went to the Rue Plumet, reconnoitred the grating and 
the garden, looked at the house, spied, watched, and, a few days 
after, carried to Magnon, who lived in the Rue Clocheperce, a bis- 
cuit, which Magnon transmitted to Babet’s mLstress at La ^ Sal- 
petriere* A biscuit, in the dark symbolism of the prisons, signifies.: 
nothing to da. 

So that in less than a week after that, Babet and Brujon, meeting 
on the way from La Force, as one was going *‘to exarnination,’ and 
the other was returning from it ; ^*Well,” asked Brujon, “the Rue 
P,?” “Biscuit,” answered Babet. 

This was the end of that feetus of crime, engendered by Brujon 
in La Force.

found on the kitchen table, and had sat down on a block of stone, 
which took the place of a seat in his garden. 

Near this seat there rose, in the fashion of the old orchard-gar- 
dens, a sort of hut, in a ruinous condition, of joists and boards, a 
warren on the ground floor, a fruit-house above. There were no 
rabbits in the warren, but there were a few apples in the fruit-house. 
A remnant of the winter’s store. 

M. Mabeuf had begun to look through, reading by the way, with 
the help of his spectacles, two books which enchanted him, and in 
which he was even absorbed, a more serious thing at his age. His 
natural timidity fitted him, to a certain extent, to accept supersti- 
tions. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President 
Delancre, On the inconstancy of Demons, the other was the quarto 
of Mutor de la Rubaudiere, On the devils of Vauvert and the gob- 
lins of La Bicve, This last book interested him the more, since his 
garden was one of the spots formerly haunted by goblins. Twilight 
was beginning to whiten all above and to blacken all below. As he 
read, Father Mabeuf was looking over the book which he held in 
his hand, at his plants, and among others at a magnificent rhodo- 
dendron which was one of his consolations; there had been four 
days of drought, wind, and sun, without a drop of rain ; the stalks 
bent over, the buds hung down, the leaves were falling, they all 
needed to be watered ; the rhododendron especially was a sad sight. 
Father Mabeuf was one of those to whom plants have souls. The 
old man had worked all day on his indigo bed, he was exhausted 
with fatigue, he got up nevertheless, put his books upon the bench, 
and walked, bent over and with tottering steps, to the well, but when 
he had grasped the chain, he could not even draw it far enough to 
unhook it. Then he turned and looked with a look of anguish towards 
the sky which was filling with stars. 

The evening had that serenity which buries the sorrows of man. 
under a strangely dreary yet eternal joy. The night promised to be 
as dry as the clay had been. 

^'Stars everywhere!” thought the old man; “not the smallest 
cloud ! not a drop of water.” 

And his head, which had been raised for a moment, fell back upon 
his breast. 

Fie raised it again and looked at the sky, murmuring : 

“A drop of dew ! a little pity !” 

He encieavoured once more to unhook the well-chain, but he 
could not 

At this moment he heard a voice which said : 

“Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden ?” 

At.the same time he heard a sound like that of a passing deer in 
the hedge, and he saw springing out of the shrubbery a sort of tall, 
slender girl, who came and stood before him, looking boldly at him. 



734 LES MISfeRABI. ES 

She had less the appearance of a Imman being than of a form which 

had just been born of the twilight. 

Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily startled, and who was, as 
we have said, subject to fear, cnuld answer a word, this l)cing, whose 
motions seemed grotesquely abrupt in the obscurity, had unhooked 
the chain, plunged in and drawn out the bucket, and tilled the water- 
ing-pot, and the goodman saw this apparition with bare feet and a 
ragged skirt running along the beds, &lt;listrii)nting liie about her. 
The sound of the water upon the leaves tilled h'ather Mabeuf’s soul 
with transport. It seemed to him tliat now the rhodc^dendron was 
happy. 

When the first bucket was emptied, the girl drew a second, then 
a third. She watered the whole gardtni.^ 

Moving thus along the walks, her outline appearing entirely black, 
shaking her torn shawl over lu;r long angular arms, she seemed 
something like a hat. 

When .she had ended, bather Mabeuf approached her with tears 
in his eyes, and laid his htuul upon her furehe;id. 

“God will bless you,” said he, “yon are an angel, .since you care 
for flowers.” 

“No,” she answered, “I am the devil, but that is all the same to 
tnc. 

The old man cxclatined, without waiting fur and without hearing 
her answer : 

“What a pity thtit I am .so unfortnnatt* and so poor, and that I 
cannot do anything for ;&gt;'on 1" 

“You can do .something,” said .she, 

“What?” 

“Tell me where M. Marius lives.” 

The old man did not tmderstaiitl 

“What Monsieur Marius?" 

He raised his glassy eye and appeared to he looking for something 
that had v'anished. 

“A young man who used to come here." 

Meanwhile M. Mabeuf had fuinliled in his nieniory. 

“Ah! yes, — ” he exclaimed, “t know what you mean. Listen, 
now! Monsieur M.nritts-^'the Tkiron Marius 1 Mitttiiercy, yes! he 
lives— Hir rather he does not live there now - ah ! well. I don’t know.” 

While he spoke, he Inu] tumt over to lie up a hnincli of the rhodo- 
dendron, and he contintied : 

“Ah! f renuanber now. Me passes up the boulevard very often, 
and goes toward I.ii (jlaeien*, Rue t rrmlebarhe. ’I'he Field of the 
Lark. G) that way. Me istt't hard to find.” 

When M. Mabeuf rose up, there was nobody there; tlie girl had 
disappeared. 

He was decidedly a little frightened. 



SAINT DENIS 735 

^"Really/’ thought he, '"if my garden was not watered, I shotild 
think it was a spirit.” 

An hour later when he had gone to bed, this returned to him, and, 
as he was falling asleep, at that troubled moment when thought, 
like that fabulous bird which changes itself into fish to pass through 
the sea, gradually takes the form of dream to pass through sleep, 
he said to himself confusedly : 

"Indeed, this much resembles what Rubaudiere relates of the 
goblins. Could it be a goblin ?” 


IV 

AN APPARITION TO MARIUS 

A FEW days after this visit of a ""spirit” to Father Mabeuf, one 
morning — it was Monday, the day on which Marius borrowed the 
hundred-sous piece of Courfeyrac for Thenardier — Marius had 
put this hundred-sous piece into his pocket, and before carrying it 
to the prison office, he had gone ""to take a little walk,” hoping that 
it would enable him to work on his return. It was eternally so. As 
soon as he rose in the morning, he sat down before a book and a sheet 
of paper to work upon some translation ; the work he had on hand 
at that time was the translation into French of a celebrated quarrel 
between two Germans, the controversy between Cans and Savigny ; 
he took Savigny, he took Cans, read four lines, tried to write one of 
them, could not, saw a star between his paper, and his eyes, and 
rose from his chair, saying : ""I will go out. That will put me in trim.” 

And he would go to the Field of the Lark. 

There tie saw the star more than ever, and Savigny and Cans 
less than ever. 

He returned, tried to resume his work, and did not succeed; he 
found no means of tying a single one of the broken threads in his 
brain ; then he would say : ""I will not go out tomorrow. It prevents 
my working.” Yet he went out every day. 

He lived in the Field of the Lark rather than in Courfeyrac's 
room. This was his real address : Boulevard de la Sante, seventh 
tree from the Rue Croulebarbe. 

That morning, he had left this seventh tree, and sat down on the 
bank of the brook of the Gobelins. The bright sun was gleaming 
through the new and glossy leaves. 

He was thinking of ""Her !” And his dreaminess, becoming re- 
proachful, fell back upon himself; he thought sorrowfully of 
the idleness, the paralysis of the soul, which was growing up within 
him, and of that night which was thickening before him hour by 
hour so rapidly that he had already ceased to see the sun. 

Meanwhile, through this painful evolution of indistinct ideas 



736 LE S M I s i: R A B L E s 

which were not even a soliloquy, so much had action become en- 
feebled within him, and he no longer had even strength to develop 
his erief— through this melancholy distraction, the sensations of the 
world without reached him. He heard behind and below him, on both 
banks of the stream, the washerwomen of the Gobelins beating 
their linen; and over his head, the birds chattering and singing in 
the elms On the one hand the sound of liberty, of happy unconcern, 
of winged leisure ; on the other, the sound of labour. A thing which 
made him muse profoundly, and almost reflect, these two joyous 

*°Xli at once, in the midst of his ecstasy of exhaustion, he, heard 
a voice which was known to him, say : 

“Ah 1 there he is !” . , t + i,-i i u t, 4 

He raised his eyes and recognised the unfortunate child who had 

come to his room one morning, the elder of the Thenardier girls, 
Eponinc * li6 now knew lier n3.niG, Sing^tilnr f 3 .ct, she li3.d become 
more wretched and more beautiful, two steps which seemed impos- 
sible She had accomplished a double progress towards the light, and 
towards distress. She was barefooted and in rags, as on the day 
when she had so resolutely entered his room, only her rags were 
two months older ; the holes were larger, the tatters dirtier. It was 
the same rough voice, the same forehead tanned and wrinkled by ex- 
posure; the same free, wild, and wandering gaze. She had, in ad- 
dition to her former expression, that mixture of fear and sorrow 

which the experience of a prison adds to misery. 

She had spears of straw and grass in her hair, not like Ophelia 
from having gone mad through the contagion of Hamlet’s madness, 
but because she had slept in some stable loft. 

And with all this, she was beautiful. What a star thou art, 0 

youth 1 ' . 

Meantime, she had stopped before Manus, with an expression of 
pleasure upon her livid face, and something which resembled a 
smile. 

She stood for a few seconds, as if she could not speak. 

“I have found you, then?” said she at last. “Father Mabeuf was 
right ; it was on this boulevard. How I have looked for you ? if you 
only knew? Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight I 
They have let me out! seeing that there was nothing against me. 
and then I was not of the age of discernment. It lacked two months. 
Oh I how I have looked for you! it is six weeks now. You don’t live 
down there any longer ?” 

“No,” said Marius. 

“Oh! I understand. On account of the affair. Such scares are dis- 
agreeable. You have moved. What ! why do you wear such an old 
hat as that ? a young man like you ought to have.fine clothes. Do you 
know. Monsieur Marius? Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, 



SAINT DENIS 737 

I forget what more. It’s not true that you are a baron ? barons are 
old fellows, they go to the Luxembourg in front of the chateau where 
there is the most sun. they read the Quotidienne for a sou. I went 
once for a letter to a baron’s like that. He was more than a hundred 
years old. But tell me, where do you live now?” 

Marius did not answer. 

“Ah !” she continued, “you have a hole in your shirt. I must mend 
it for you.” 

She resumed with an expression which gradually grew darker : 

“Y ou don’t seem to be glad to see me ?” 

Marius said nothing ; she herself was silent for a moment, then 
exclaimed : 

“But if I would, I could easily make you glad !” 

“How?” inquired Marius. “What does that mean?” 

“Ah ! you used to speak more kindly to me!” replied she. 

“Well, what is it that you mean?” 

She bit her lip ; she seemed to hesitate, as if passing through a 
kind of interior struggle. At last, she appeard to decide upon her 
course. 

“So much the worse, it makes no difference. You look sad, I want 
you to be glad. But promise me that you will laugh, I want to see 
you laugh and hear you say : Ah, well ! that is good. Poor Monsieur 
Marius 1 you know, you promised me that you would give me what- 
ever I should ask — ’ 

“Yes! but tell me!” 

She looked into Marius’ eyes and said : 

“I have the address.” 

Marius turned pale. All his blood flowed back to his heart. 

“What address ?” 

“The address you asked me for.” 

She added as if she were making an effort ; 

“The address — ^you know well enough 1” 

“Yes !” stammered Marius. 

“Of the young lady !” 

Having pronounced this word, she sighed deeply. 

Marius sprang up from the bank on which he was sitting, and took 
her wildly by the hand. 

“Oh ! come ! show me the yray, teU me ! ask me for whatever you 
will! Where is it?” 

“Come with me,” she answered. “I am not sure of the street and 
the number ; it is away on the other side from here, but I know the 
house vep^ well. I will show you.” 

_ She withdrew her hand and added' in a tone which would have 
pierced the heart of an observer, but which did not even touch the 
intoxicated and transported Marius: 

“Oh ! how gla&lt;l you are !" 



738 L E S M I S ft R A Tt I. E S 

A cloud passed over Marius’ brow, lie .seized Eponine by the 
arm : 

“Swear to me one thing!” 

“Swear?” said she, “what does that mean? Alil you want me to 
swear?” 

And she laughed. 

_ “Your father 1 promise me, Eponine I swear to me that you will not 
give this addre.s.s to your father !” 

She turned towards him witii an astoundeti appearance. 

“Eponine ! How do you know that my name is Eponine ?” 

“Promi.se what I ask you !” 

But she clid not .seem to nnderstan&lt;l. _ 

“That is nice! you called me Eponine!" 

Marius caught licr Ity botli arm.s at once. 

“But answer me now, in heaven's name ! j&gt;ay attention to what I 
am saying, swear to me that you will not give the address you know 
to your father !’’ 

“Aly father ?” .said she, ‘‘Oh ! yes, my failier ! Do not he concerned 
on his account. He is in .solitary. l’ii"'ides, do i Imsy myself ahoutmy

“But you don’t pruuiise me !’’ e.vcl,aimeti .Marius, 

“Let me go then!” .sail! _sh«‘, bursting into a langh, “how you

“Nor to anybody ?’’ said Marius. 

“Nor to anylKHly," 

“Now,” added Marius, “show me the w.ay." 

“Right aw.ay?’’ 

“Right away.” 

'‘t’ome. Dh ! how glad he is !" said .she. 

After a few .ste|&gt;.s, .slie .siopjietl. 

“^'uu follow too near me. .Monsieur Marius, I.et me go forward, 
and follow me like tlmt, witlioiii seeming to. It won't do for a fine 
young man, like von, to l&lt;e .seeti with a woman like me.” 

No tongue could tell all that there w.as in that word, woman, thus 
uttered 5»y this child. 

She wettt on a few steps, atul stopjwd again ; .Marius rcjoitied 
her, .She spoke to him aside and without turning:

.THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET 
I 

THE SECRET HOUSE 

# 

Towards the middle of the last century, a velvet-capped president 
of the Parlement of Paris having a mistress and concealing it, for 
in those days the great lords exhibited their mistresses and the bour- 
geois concealed theirs, had ^^une petite maisCn'^ built in the Faubourg 
Saint Germain, in the deserted Rue de Blomet, now called the Rue 
Plumet, not far from the spot which then went by the name of the 
Combat des Animaux. 

This was a summer-house of but two stories; two rooms on the 
ground floor, two chambers in the second story, a kitchen below, a 
boudoir above, a garret next the roof, the whole fronted by a garden 
with a large iron grated gate opening on the street. This garden con- 
tained about an acre. This was all that the passers-by could see ; but 
in the rear of the house there was a small yard, at the further end of 
which there was a low building, two rooms only and a cellar, a con- 
venience intended to conceal a child and nurse in case of need. This 
building communicated, from the rear, by a masked door opening 
secretly, with a long narrow passage, paved, winding, open to the 
sky, bordered by two high walls, and which, concealed with won- 
derful art, and as it were lost between the inclosures of the gardens 
and fields, all the corners and turnings of which it followed, came 
to an end at another door, also concealed, which opened a third of a 
mile away, almost in another quartier, upon the unbuilt end of the 
Rue de Babylone. 

The president came in this way, so that those even who might 
have watched and followed him, and those who might have ob- 
served that the president went somewhere mysteriously every day, 
could not have suspected that going to the Rue de Babylone wa^ 
going to the Rue Blomet. By skilful purchases of land, the in- 
genious magistrate was enabled to have this secret route to his 
house made upon his own ground, and consequently without super- 
vision. He had afterwards sold off the lots of ground bordering on 
the passage in little parcels for flower and vegetable gardens, and 
the proprietors of these lots of ground supposed on both sides thai

what they saw was a partition wall, and did not even suspect the 
existence of that long ribbon of paveineiit winding between two 
wails among their beds and fruit trees. 'I'he birds alone saw this 
curiosity. It is probable that the larks and tlu? sparrows of the last 
century had a good deal of chattering about the president. 

The house, built of stone in the Mansard style, wainscoted, and 
furnished in the Watteau style, rock-work witiiin, pendve without, 
walled about with a triple hcilge of llowers, had a discreet, coquet- 
tish, and solemn appearance about it, suitalile to a caprice of love 
and of magistracy. 

This house and this passage, which have since disapiienrcd, were 
still in existence fifteen years ago. In '93, a coppersmith bought the 
house to pull it down, but not being aide to jiaj'the price for it, the 
nation sent him into bankruptcy. .So that it was the house that 
pulled down the cojiperstnith. Tlierenfter the house remained empty, 
and fell .slowly into ruin, like all &lt;lwellings to which the presence 
’of man no longer communicates life. It remained, furni.shed with its 
old furniture, and always for sale or to let, and th(! ten or twelve 
persons who passed through the Kue I’luinet in the course of a 
year were uotified of this by a yellow and illegible piece of paper 
which had hung upon the railing of the garden since 1810. 

Towards the end of the Restoration, these .same passer.s might 
have noticed that the pajicr hail disappeared, and tliat, also, the 
shutters of the tqiper story were open. 'I’he house was indeed oc- 
cupied. 'rite windows had “little curtains,’’ a sign that there was a 
woman there. 

In the month of October, 1820, a man of a certain age had ap- 
peared and hired the house as it .stood, including, of course, the 
building in the rear, and the passage which ran ont to the Rue de 
Babylone. He had the secret openings of the two doors of tliis pas- 
sage repaired. The house, as we have just said, was still nearly fur- 
nished with the jircsiilent’s ok! funiilure. The new tenant had 
ordered a few repair.s, added here and there what was lacking, put 
in a few flag.s in the yard, a few bricks in the basement, a few steps 
in the staircase, a few tiles in the floors, a, fi'w panes in the windows, 
and finally came and installed himself with a young girl and an aged 
servant, without any noise, rather like sonielKuly stealing in than 
like a man who entens hi.s own house, 'rhe neighlaiurs did not gossip 
about it, for the reason that there were no neighbour.s. 

This tenant, to partial extent, Wtis Jean Valjean ; the young girl 
was Cosette. The .servant was a spinster named 'fonssaint, whom 
Jean Valjean had saved from the hospital and misery, and v.'ho 
was old, stuttering, and a native of a province, three finaHtie.s which 
had determined Jean Valjean to lake her with him. He hired the 
house under the name of Monsieur l«''auche!evetJt, gentleman. In 



SAINT DENIS 741 

what has been related hitherto, the reader doubtless recognised 
Jean Valjean even before Thenardier did. 

Why had Jean Valjean left the convent of the Petit Picpus? 
What had happened ? 

Nothing had happened. 

As we remember, Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so 
happy that his conscience at last began to be troubled. He saw 
Cosette every day, he felt paternity springing up and developing 
within him more and more, he brooded this child with his soul, he 
said to himself that she was his, that nothing could take her from him, 
that this would be so indefinitely, that certainly she would become 
a nun, being every day gently led on towards it, that thus the con- 
vent was henceforth the universe to her as well as to him, that he 
would grow old there and she would grow up there, that she would 
grow old there and he would die there ; that finally, ravishing hope, 
no separation was possible. In reflecting upon this, he at last began 
to find difficulties. He questioned himself. He asked himself if all 
this happiness were really his own, if it were not made up of the 
happiness of another, of the happiness of this child whom he was 
appropriating and plundering, he, an old man; if this was not a 
robbery? He said to himself that this child had a right to know 
what life was before renouncing it; that to cut her off, in advance, 
and, in some sort, without consulting her, from all pleasure, under 
pretence of saving her from all trial, to take advantage of her igno- 
rance and isolation to give her an artificial vocation, was to outrage 
a human creature and to lie to God. And who knows but, thinking 
over all this some day, and being a nun with regret, Cosette might 
come to hate him ? a final thought, which was almost selfish and less 
heroic than the others, but which was insupportable to him. He re- 
solved to leave the convent. 

He resolved it, he recognised with despair that it must be done. 
As to objections, there were none. Five years of sojourn between 
those four walls, and of absence from among men, had necessarily 
destroyed or dispersed the elements of , alarm. He might return 
tranquilly among men. He had grown old, and all had changed. Who 
would recognize him now ? And then, to look at the worst, there was 
no danger save for himself, and he had no right to condemn Cosette 
to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the gal- 
leys. What, moreover, is danger in presence of duty? Finally, noth- 
ing prevented him from being prudent, and taking proper precau- 
tions. 

As to Cosette’s education, it was almost finished and complete. 

His determination once formed, he awaited an opportunity. It 
was not slow to present itself. Old Fauchelevent died. 

Jean Valjean asked an audience of the reverend prioress, and told 
her that having received a small inheritance on the death of his 



742 I. E S M I S E K A B I- E S 

brother, which enabled him to live henceforth without labour, he 
would leave the service of the convent, and take awjiy his dausjhter' 
but that, as it was not just that Cosette, not taking her vows should 
have been educated gratuitously, lie humbly hegg.;d the reverend 
prioress to allow him to offer the community, as indemnitv for the 
five years which Cosette had passed there, the sum of live thousand 
francs. 

Thus Jean Valjcan left the convent _of the I'erjietual Adoration. 

On leaving the_ convent, he took in his own hainis. and would not 
entrust to any assi.stant, the lit tic box, thekev of which lie always had 
about him. This ho.x puzzled^ Cosette, on account oi the odour of 
embalming which c:une from it. 

Let us say at once, that henceforth this box never left him more. 
He always had it in his room. It was ■.lie first, and sometimes the 
only thing that he carried awav in his changes of abode. Cosette 
laughed aliout it, and called tltis box the iuHvpurahh'j saying :‘Tam 
jealous of it. 

Jean Valjcan nevertheless tlid not ajipear again in the open city 
without deep anxiety. 

He discovered the house in the Rue I’lnmet, anil buried himself in 
it. He was henceforth in possession of the name of Ullimus I'auch- 
elevent. 

At the same time hi; liireii two other Imlgings in i ’aris, in order to 
attract less attention than it he always remained in the .same &lt;|narticr 
to he able to cliange his aliode lui oecasion, at the slightest anxiety 
which he might feel, and finally, that he migln not again find him- 
self in .such a .strait as on the "night when lie had so mir;iciiIou.sly 
escaped from Jnvert. These two lodgings were twn very humble 
dwellings, and of a jXKjr appwtrance, in two &lt;iiutrtters widely distant 
from each other, one in the Rue de rOuest, the other in tlie Rue de 
rHomme Anne, 

He went from time* to time, now to tlie Rue de rflomme Arme, 
and now to the Rue ile TOuest, to spend a moiitli or six weeks, with 
Cosette, wit hunt taking Toussaint, He was waited tifioii hy tlie port- 
ers, and gave himself out for a man of some means of tlie suburbs, 
having a foothold in the city. 'I’his lofty virttte litid three domiciles 
in Paris in order to escape from the police.

JEAN VALJEAN A NATIONAL GUARD 

Still, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had 
ordei'cd his life there in the following manner : 

Cosctte with the servant occupied the house; she had the large 
bedroom with painted piers, the boudoir with gilded mouldings, 
the president’s parlour furnished with tapestry and huge ai'm-chairs ; 
she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a bed put into Cosette’a 
chamlier with a canopy of antique damask in three colours, and an 
old and beautiful Persian carpet, bought at Mother Gaucher’s in 
the Rue du Figuier Saint Paul, and, to soften the severity of these 
nuignificent relics, he had ad&lt;led to this curiosity shop all the little 
lively and graceful pieces of furniture used by young girls, an 
clagere, a bookcase and gilt books, a writing-case, a blotting-case 
a work-table inlaid with pearl, a silver-gilt dressing-case, a dressing 
tabic in Japan porcekiin. Long damask curtains ol three colours, 
on a red ground, matching those of the bed, bung at the second 
story windows. On the first floor, tapestry curtains. All winter 
Cosette’s Petite liaison was warmed from top to bottom. For his 
part, he lived in the sort of porter's lodge in the back-yard, with a 
mattress on a cot bedstead, a white wood table, two straw chairs, 
an earthen water-pitcher, a few books upon a board, his dear box. 
in a corner, never any lire. lie dined with Cosette, and there was a 
black loaf on the table for him. lie said to Toussaint, when she en- 
tered their service : “Ma(lemoi.sc!le is the mistress of the house.” 
“And you, m-monsieur?” replied' Toussaint, astounded. “Me I 
am much better than the master, I am the father,” 

Cosette h.'ul been trained* to housekeeping in the convent, and 
.she regulated the expenses, which were very moderate. Every day 
Jean Valjean took Cosette’s arm, and went to walk with her. They 
went to the U;ast frequented walk of the Luxemlxiurg, and every 
Sunday to jnas.s, always at Saint Jacques du Haut Pas, because it 
was quite distant. As that is a very poor quartier, he gave much 
alms there, atid the unfortunate surrounded him in the church, which 
had given him the title of the superscription of thg epistle of the 
Thenardiers ; T&amp; the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint 
Jacques du Haut Pas. He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the 
needy and the sick. No stranger came into the house in the Rue 
Plumet. Toussaint brought the provisions, and Jean Valjean him- 
self went after the water to a watering trough which was near by on 
the boulevard. They kept the wood and the wine in a kind of semi- 
subterranean vault covered with roclf-work, which was near the dooi' 
on the Rue de Babylone, and which had formerly served the presi- 



744 lesmis^rables 

dent as a grotto ; for, in the time of the Folios and the Petites Mai- 

sons, there was no love without a grotto. 

There was on the Rue de Baby lone door a box for letters and 
papers • but the three occupants of the summer-house on the Rue 
Plumet receiving neither papers nor letters, the ejrtire use of the 
box formerly the agent of amours and the confidant of a legal 
spark was now limited to the notices of the receiver of taxes and 
the Guard warnings. For M. Fauchdevent belonged to the National 
Guard - he had not been able to escape the close meshes of the en- 
rollment of 1831. The municipal investigation made at that time had 
extended even to the convent of the Petit Piepus, a sort of im- 
penetrable and holy cloud'from which Jean Valjean had come forth 
Werable in the eyes of his magistracy, and, in consequence, worthy 
of mounting guard. 

Three or four times a year, Jean Valjcan donned his uniform, 
and performed his duties; very willingly moreover; it was a good 
disguise for him, which associated him with everybody else while 
leaving him solitary. Jean Valjean had cnmiileted his sixtieth year, 
the age of legal exemption ; but he did not ai&gt;pear more than fifty; 
moreover, he had no desire to ascape from his sergeant-major and 
to cavil with the Count de Lobaii ; he ha&lt;l no civil standing ; he was 
concealing his name, he was concealing his identity, he was conceal- 
ing his age, he was concealing everything ; aiul, we have just said, 
he was very willingly ; National Guard. 'I'o resemble the crowd who 
pay their taxes, this was his whole ambition. 'I'liis man had for his 
ideal within, the angel— without, the bourgeois. 

We must note one incident, however. When Jean Valjean went 
out with Cosettc, he dre led as we have seen, and had much the air 
of an old officer. When he went out alone, and this was most usually 
in the evening, he was always chd in the waisteottt and trousers of a 
working-man, and wore a cap which hid his face. Was this precau- 
tion, or humility? Both at once. Cosette was actntstomed to the 
enigmatic aspect of her destiny, and hardly noticed her father’s 
singnlaritie.s. As for Toussnint, .she venenitetl Jean Valjean, and 
thought everything good that he did. One day, her butcher, who had 
caught sight of Jean Valjean, said to her: “Tliat is a funny body.” 
She an.swered; ^Tle is a s-.saint !" 

Neither Jean Valjean, nor Cosette, nor Toussaint, ever came in or 
went out except by the gate on the Rue tie Itabyltine. Unless one had 
seen tliem through the gnitetl gate of the gartlen, it wtuild liave been 
difficult to guess that thev lived in the Rue I’lumet, This gate always 
remained closed. Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated, 
that it might not attract attenlitm. 

In this, he deceived himself, perhaps.

FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS 

This garden, thus abandoned to itself for more than half a century, 
had become very strange and very pleasant. The passers-by of forty 
years ago stopped in the street to look at it, without suspecting the 
secrets which it concealed behind its fresh green thickets. More than 
one dreamer of that day has many a time allowed his eyes arid his 
thoughts indiscreetly to penetrate through the bars of the ancient 
gate which was padlocked, twisted, tottering ; secured by two green 
and mossy pillars, and grotesquely crowned with a pediment of in- 
decipherable arabesque. 

There was a stone seat in a corner, one or two mouldy statues, 
some trellises loosened by time and rotting upon the wall ; no walks, ' 
moreover, nor turf; dog-grass everywhere. Horticulture had de- 

? arted, and nature had returned. Weeds were abundant, a wonder- 
ul hap for a poor bit of earth. The heyday of the gilliflowers was 
splendid. Nothing in this garden opposed the sacred effort of things 
towards life ; venerable growth was at home there. The trees bent 
over towards the briers, the briers mounted towards the trees, the 
shrub had climbed, the branch had bowed, that which runs upon the 
ground had attempted to find that which blooms in the air, that which 
floats in the wind had stooped towards that which trails in the moss ; 
trunks, branches, leaves, twigs, tufts, tendrils, shoots, thorns, were 
mingled, crossed, married, confounded ; vegetation, in a close and 
strong embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there under the 
satisfied eye of the Creator, in this inclosure of three hundred feet 
square, the sacred niystery of its fraternity, symbol of human fra- 
ternity. This garden was no longer a garden ; it was a colossal bush, 
that is to say, something which is as impenetrable as a forest, popu- 
lous as a city, tremulous as a nest, dark as a cathedral, odorous as 
a bouquet, solitary as a tomb, full of life as a multitude. 

In Floreal, this enormous shrub, free behind its grating and within 
its four walls, warmed into the deep labour of universal germina- 
tion, thrilled at the rising sun almost like a stag which inhales the 
air of universal love and feels the April sap mounting and boiling 
in his veins, and shaking its immense green antlers in the wind, scat- 
tered over the moist ground, over the broken statues, over the sink- 
ing staircase of the summer-house, and even over the pavement of 
the deserted street, flowers in stars, dew in pearls, fecundity, beauty, 
life, joy, perfume. At noon, a- thousand white butterflies took refuge 
in it, and it was a heavenly sight to see this living snow of summer 
whirling about in flakes in the shade. There, in this gay darkness of 
vrerdure, a multitude of innocent voices spoke softly to the soul, and 
W’hat the warbling had forgotten to say, the humming completed. At 



746 L E S MIS k K A n I, k s 

night, a dreamy vapour arose from the gai'dcn and wrapped it 
around; a shroud of mist, a ralm ami celestial sadness, covered it- 
the intoxicating odour of honeysuckles and himlweed’ rose on all 
sides like an exquisite and subtle poison ; you heard the last appeals 
of the woodpecker, and the wagtails flrowsing under the branches- 
you felt the sacred intiniai-y of liirtl and tree; liy tlay the wings re-^ 
joiced the leaves ; by night the leaves iimteeted the wings. 

In winter, the bush was bkick, wel, bristling, shivering, and let 
the house be seen in part, ^'on pereeived, instead of the flowers in 
the branches and the dew in the tlmvers, the lung .silver riidjons of 
the snails upon the thick and cold carin-t of yellow leaves; but in 
every way, under every aspect, in every season, sjjring, ’winter 
Bitmmer, autumn, this little inclosure exhaled melaneholy,’ contem- 
plation, .snlitndc, lilx-rty, (he ahsenec of inan, the ])reseiH-e of God 
and the old rusty gral ing appeareil to s;ty ; "■riiis g,-irden is mine !” ’ 

In vain was the pavenieiil of i’aris .-ill ;ihnnt it, the classic and

stands the reciprocal flux and reflux of the infiniely great and the 
infinitely small, the echoing of causes in the abysses of being, and the 
avalanches of creation? A flesh-worm is of account; the small is 
great, the great is small ; all is in equilibrium in necessity ; fearful 
vision for the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings 
and things ; in this inexhaustible whole, from sun to grub, there is 
no scorn ; all need each other. Light does not carry terrestrial per- 
fumes into the azure depths without knowing what it does with them ; 
night distributes the stellar essence to the sleeping plants. Every 
bird which flies has the thread of the infinite in its claw. Germination 
includes the hatching of a meteor and the tap of a swallow’s bill 
breaking the egg, and it leads forward the birth of an earth-worm 
and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the micro- 
scope begins. Which of the two has the grander view ? Choose. A 
bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers ; a nebula is an anthill of stars. The 
same promiscuity, and still more wonderful, between the things of the 
intellect and the things of matter. Elements and principles are 
mingled, combined, espoused, multiplied one by another, to such a 
degree as to bring the material world and the moral world into the 
same light. Phenomena ai-e perpetually folded back upon themselves. 
In the vast cosmical changes, the universal life comes and goes in 
unknown quantities, rolling all in the invisible mystery of the ema- 
nations, losing no dream from no single sleep, sowing an animalcule 
here, crumbling a star there, oscillating and winding, making a 
force of light and an element of thought, disseminated and indivisi- 
ble, dissolving all, save that geometrical point, the me; reducing 
everything to the soul-atom ; making everything blossom into God ; 
entangling, from the highest to the lowest, all activities in the ob- 
scurity of a dizzying mechanism, hanging the flight of an insect 
upon the movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows ? were 
it only by the identity^ of the law, the evolutions of the comet in the 
firmament to the circling of the infusoria in the drop of water. A ma- 
chine made of mind. Enormous gearing, whose first motor is the 
gnat, and whose last wheel is the zodiac.

CHANGE OF GRATING 

It seemed as if this garden, first made to conceal licentious mys- 
teries, had been transformed and rendered fit for the shelter of 
chaste mysteries. There were no longer in it either bowers, or lawns, 
or arbours, or grottoes; there was a magnificent dishevelled ob- 
scurity falling like a veil upon all sides; Paphos had become 
Eden again. Some secret repentance had purified this retreat. This 
flower-girl now offered its flowers to the soul. This coquettish gar-

den, once so very free, had returned to virginity and modesty. A 
president assisted by a gardener, a guodman who thought he was 
a second Lamoignon, and another goodman who thought he was a 
second Lenotre, had distorted it, pruned it, crumpled it, bedizened it. 
fashioned it for gallantry ; nature had taken it again, liad filled it 
with shade, and had arrangcfl it for love. 

There was also in this .solitude a lu'art winch was all ready. Love 
had only to show himself : there was a temidc there composed of 
verdure, of grass, of moss, of the sighs of birds, of soft shade, of 
agitated branches, and a soul made up of gentleness, of faith, of 
candour, of hope, of aspiration, and of illusion. 

Cosette had left the convent, .still almost a child ; .she was a little 
more than fourteen years old, tind she was “at the ungrateful age;” 
as we have .said, apart from her eyes, she seemed rather homely 
than pretty; .she had, however, no uiigruceful features, but she was 
awkward, thin, timid, and bold at the ,s.aiiie time, a big child in .short. 

Her education was finisheil ; that is to say, she liatl been taught 
religion, and also, and .above all, ^ievigion: then “history," that is, 
the thing which they call thus in the convemt. geography, grammar, 
the ixirticiplcs, the kings of France, a litih? music, to draw profiles, 
etc., but further than this .she was igiior.ml of everything, which is 
a charm and a peril. The soul of a young girl ttught not to he left in 
obscurity: in after life there spring up too svulden and too vivid 
mirages,’ as in ;i camera obsenrtv. She shtnild he gently ami di.screetly 
enlightened, rather Iw the reflection &lt;tf realities than Iiy their direct 
and'stern light, A useful an&lt;l graciously severe halflight which dissi- 
pates puerile fear and prevents a fa!l._ N'othiug Init the maternal in- 
stinct, a wonderful intuition into wliich enter the memories of the 
maiden and the experience of tlie ■woman, knows lunv this half-light 
should hf; applied, and of what it should he fi trim-d. Xothing supplies 
this imstinct. 'I'o form tht; mind of a young girl, all the mm,s in the 
world are not equal to one mother. 

Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in 
the plural. 

As to Jean Valjean, there was indeetl within him all manner of 
tenderness and all manner i»f .solicitude ; Imt lie was only tin old man 
who knew nothing at all. 

Now, iti this work of ednetition, in this serious matter of the pre-’ 
paration of a woman for life, liow mneh knowledge is needed to 
struggle against that ignoranee whieh we call innoeenee. 

Nothing prepares a young gir! for pttssions like the convent. The 
convent turns the thoughts in the ilireetion of the unknown. The 
heart, thrown Ittiek njion itself, makes for itself a channel, being 
unable to overflow, and deeiH-ns, fieing uiiahle to expand. From 
thence visions, sitpjxisit ions, con jecttires, nanances .sketched out, 
longings for adventures, fantastic const nictions, whole castles built 



SAINT DENIS 749 

in the interior oDscurity of the mind, dark and secret dwellings where 
the passions find an immediate lodging as soon as the grating is 
crossed and they are permitted to enter. The convent is a compres- 
sion which, in order to triumph over the human heart, must continue 
through the whole life. 

On leaving the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more 
grateful and more dangerous than the house on the Rue Plumet. It 
was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty; an 
inclosed garden, but a sharp, rich, voluptuous, and odorous nature ; 
the same dreams as in the convent, but with glimpses of young men ; 
a grating, but upon the street. 

Still, we repeat, when she came there she was but a child. Jean 
Valjean gave her this uncultivated garden. ^‘Do whatever you like 
with it,’’ said he to her. It delighted Cosette ; she ransacked every 
thicket and turned over every stone, she sought for ‘‘animals she 
played while she dreamed; she loved this garden for the insects 
which she found in the grass under her feet, while she loved it for 
the stars which she saw in the branches over her head. 

And then she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with 
all her heart, with a frank filial passion which made the good man 
a welcome and very pleasant companion for her. We remember 
that M. Madeleine was a great reader; Jean Valjean continued it; 
through this he had come to talk very well ; he had the secret wealth 
and the eloquence of a humble and earnest intellect which has se- 
cured its own culture. He retained just enough harshness to flavour 
his goodness ; he had a rough mind and a gentle heart. At the Luxem- 
bourg in their conversations, he gave long explanations of every- 
thing, drawing from what he had read, drawing also from what he 
had suffered. As she listened, Cosette’s eyes wandered dreamily. 

This simple man was sufficient for Cosette’s thought, even as 
this wild garden was to her eyes. When she had had a good chase 
after the butterflies, she would come up to him breathless and say, 
“Oh! how I have run!” He would kiss her forehead. 

Cosette adored the good man. She was always running after him. 
Where Jean Valjean was, was happiness. As Jean Valjean did not 
live in the summer-house or the garden, she found more pleasure 
in the paved back-yard than in the inclosure full of flowers, and in 
the little bedroom furnished with straw chairs than in the great 
parlour hung with tapestry, where she could recline on silken arm- 
chairs. Jean Valjean sometimes said to her, smiling with the hap- 
piness of being teased: “Why don’t you go home? why don’t you 
leave me alone ?” 

She would give him those charming Jittle scoldings which are so 
full of grace coming from the daughter to the father. 

“Father, I am very cold in your house; why don’t you put in a 
carpet and a stove her^

*M5ecaus(a my slaughter/’ 

**Well, if ytm eat it, 1 shall &lt;ntt it/* 

Then, so that Cosette should ne^t eat hlaek fu’ead, Jean Valjean 
ate white iiread.

formidable it seemed to him. He thought of Fantine and felt over- 
whelmed with silence. He saw dimly in the darkness something 
which resembled a finger on a mouth. Had all that modesty which 
had once been Fantine’s and which, during her life, had been forced 
out of her by violence, returned after her death to take its place over 
her, to watch, indignant, over the peace of the dead woman, and to 
guard her fiercely in her tomb ? Did Jean Valjean, without knowing 
it, feel its influence? We who believe in death are not of those who 
would reject this mysterious explanation. Hence the impossibility" 
of pronouncing, even at Cosette’s desire, this name : Fantine. 

One day Cosette said to him : 

‘‘Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two 
jgreat wings. My mother must have attained to sanctity in her life.” 

“Through martyrdom,” answered Jean Valjean. 

Still, Jean Valjean was happy. 

When Cosette went out with him, she leaned upon his arm, proud, 
happy, in the fulness of her heart. Jean Valjean, at all these marks 
of a tenderness so exclusive and so fully satisfied with him alone, 
felt his thought melt into delight. The poor man shuddered, over- 
flowed with an angelic joy; he declared in his transport that this 
would last through life; he said to himself that he really had not 
suffered enough to deserve such radiant happiness, and he thanked 
God, in the depths of his soul, for having permitted that he, a mis- 
erable man, should be so loved by this innocent being. 


V 

THE ROSE DISCOVERS THAT SHE IS AN ENGINE OF WAR 

One day Cosette happened to look in her mirror, and she said to 
herself : “What !” It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This 
threw her into strange anxiety. Up to this moment she had never 
thought of her face. She had seen herself in her glass, but she had 
not looked at herself. And then, she had often been told that she 
was homely ; Jean Valjean alone would quietly say : “Why no ! why ! 
no !” However that might be, Cosette had always thought herself 
homely, and had grown up in that idea with the pliant resignation of 
childhood. And now suddenly her mirror said like Jean Valjean: 
“Why no !” She had no sleep that night. “If I were pretty !” thought 
she, “how funny it would be if I should b^ pretty !” And she called 
'to mind those of her companions whose beauty had made an im- 
pression in the convent, and said: “What! I should be like Made- 
moiselle Such-a-onel” 

The next day she looked at herself, but not by chance, and she 
doubted. “Where were my wits gone?” said she, “no, I 
She had merely slept badly, her eyes were dark 



752 LKS MISER MILKS 

She had not felt very happy the evenin,i^ hvUn\% in the thought that 
she was beantifuh but she was sail at thinking so no longer. She did 
not loiik at herself again, and bn* more than a fortnight she tried to 
&lt;lress her hair with Irt ])ack to tlte ininair. 

In the evening after &lt;linner, slie regitlarly made tapestry or did 
some convetit work in the |»arlotir, while J**an X'aljean read hy her 
side. Once, on raising her twes from her wn!*k, she was very much 
surprised at the anxious way in which her father was looking at her. 

At another time, she was passing ahnig the strta*!, and it seemed 
to her that someljody l)ehind lu‘r, whiun she t!id not sec*, said : **Pretty 
, woman ! but badly (iressed.’’ Pshaw !*’ thimght she, 'hhat is not me* 
I am well dressed ami lunnely.** She had un at the time her plush hat 
and merino dress. 

At last, .she was in the. garden one day, and heard pt»or tihl Tons- 
saint saying: *‘I!^!i»nsieur, do you isgiia' how pretty madtanoiselle Is 
growing?” Cosette di*! not hear what her father answenal. Tous*« 
sainPs wonls threw her into a son of emmuotion. She ran out t)f the 
garden, went ujnoher nmnu hurriet! to the glass, it was three numths 
since she h:ul looke&lt;i at herstdf, atid uttered a cry. Slu: was ikuzlcd 
by luu’self. 

She was lusautifnl and hamlsome; she could not help being of 
Tou.ssaint s and her mirrnrV n|4nion, Iha* form was nmgjlete, her 
skin had become whil&lt;% her hair had growti Instnms, ati unknown

was of her evidently that the |»asser had spoken, there was no more 
doubt ; she went dtnvn into the garden again, thinking herself a 
queen, hearing tlte birds sing, it was in winter, seeing the sky golden, 
the sunshine in tin* trers, llowers among tlie stiruhliery, wild, mad, 
in an inexiiressihle rapture. 

hdr his part, Jean \ aijrvm ff lt a deep and undelinalde anguishin 
his heart. 

He had in fail, for some time past, lireiieifutemplaling with terror 
that bi'aiity wliich appeared every day more radiant npr«n Caisette^s 
smwt face. A dawn, chanidng lu all others, dreary to him.

might be at any instant retaken, and led back from the obscurity of 
his virtue to the broad light of public shame, this man accepted all, 
excused all, pardoned all, blessed all, wished well to all, and only 
asked of Providence, of men, of the laws, of society, of nature, of 
the world, this one thing, that Cosette should love him ! 

That Cosett should continue to love him ! That God would not 
prevent the heart of this child from coming to him, and remaining 
his ! Loved by Cosette, he felt himself healed, refreshed, soothed, 
satisfied, rewarded, crowned. Loved by Cosette, he was content! 
he asked nothing more. Had anybody said to him : *'Do you desire 
anything better he would have answered : “No.’^ Had God said to 
him : '‘Do you desire heaven ?” he would have answered : 'T should 
be the loser.’" 

Whatever* might affect this condition, were it only on the surface, 
made him shudder as if it were the coiiimencement of another. 
He had never known very clearly what the beauty of a woman was ; 
but, by instinct, he understood, that it was terrible. 

This beauty which was blooming out more and more triumphant 
and superb beside him, under his eyes, upon the ingenuous and 
fearful brow of this child — ^he looked upon it, from the depths of 
his ugliness, his old age, his misery, his reprobation, and his dejec- 
tion, with dismay. 

He said to himself : "How beautiful she is 1 What will become of 
me ?” 

Here in fact was the difference between his tenderness and the 
tenderness of a mother. What he saw with anguish, a mother would 
have seen with delight. 

The first symptoms were not slow to manifest themselves. 

From the morrow of the day on whicli she had said : "Really, I 
am handsome I” Cosette^gave attention to her dress. She recalled the 
words of the passer : "Pretty, but badly dressed,” breath of an oracle 
which had passed by her and vanished after depositing in her heart 
one of the two germs which must afterwards fill the whole life of the 
woman, coquetry. Love is the other. 

With faith in her beauty, the entire feminine soul blossomed within 
her. She was horrified at the merino and ashamed of the plush. Her 
father had never refused her anything. She knew at once the whole 
science of the hat; the dress, the cloak, the boot, the cuff, the stuff 
which sits well, the colour which is becoming, that science which 
makes the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and so 
dangerous. The phrase heady womM was invented for her. 

In less than a month little Cosette was, in that Thebaid of the Rue 
de Babylone, not only one of the prettiest women, which is some- 
thing, but one of "the best dressed” in Paris, which is much more. 
She would have liked to meet "her passer” to hear what he would 
say, and "to show him 1” The truth is that she was ravishing in every

VI 


THE BATTLE COMMENCES 


CosETTE, in her seclusion, like Marius in his, was all ready to take 
fire. Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, was slowly 
bringing these two beings near each other, fully charged and all 
languishing with the stormy electricities of passion, — ^these two 
souls which held love as two clouds hold lightning, and which were 
to meet and mingle in a glance like clouds in a flash. 

The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, 
that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say 
that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each 
other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only. 
The rest is only the rest, and comes afterwards. Nothing is more 
real than these great shocks which two souls give each other in ex- 
changing this spark. • . i i i j 

At that particular moment when Cosette unconsciously looked 
with this glance which so affected Marius, Marius had no suspicion 
that he also had a glance which affected Cosette. 

She received from him the same harm and the same blessing. 

For a long time now she had seen and scrutinised him as young 
girls scrutinise and see, while looking another way. Marius still 
thought Cosette ugly, while Cosette already began to think Marius 
beautiful. But as he paid no attention to her, this young man was 


quite indifferent to her. , , ..-r i 

Still she could not help saying to herself that he had beautiful 
hair, beautiful eyes, beautiful teeth, a charming voice, when she 
heard him talking with his comrades; that he walked with aH_ awk- 
ward gait, if you wiU, but with a grace of his own ; that he did n- 1 
appear altogether stupid; that his, whole person was noble, gentle, 
natural, and proud, and finally that he had a poor appearance, but 

that he had a good appearance. . , , , . v .t. ..t. 

On the day their eyes met and at last said abruptly to both those 
first obscure and ineffable things which the glance stamrners out, 
Cosette at first did not comprehend. She went back pensivly to the 
house in the Rue de I’Ouest, to which Jean Valjean, according to his 
custom, had gone to spend six weeks. The next day, on waking, she 
thought of this unknown young man, so long indifferent and icy, 
who now seemed to give some attention to her, and it did not seem 
to her that this attention was in the least degree pleasant. She was 
rather a little angry at this disdainful beau. An under-current of war 
was excited in her. It seemed to her, and she felt a pleasure in it 
still altogether childish, that at last she should be avenged. 

Knowing that she was beautiful, she felt thoroughly, although in 
an indistinct way, that she had a weapon. W omen play with their 



756 X. E S MIS E R A n T. E S 

beauty as chilclreu &lt;Iu with tlu‘ir knives. 1*hey wouikI themselves 

with it. 

We remember Maritts’ hesitations, his palpitations, his terrors. 
He remained at his scat and did not ajJiJiatacln which vexed Coselte* 
One day she said to jean Valjean : ‘Msather, Ui, us walk a little this 
way/* Seeing that Alarins was uut coming ti* her, she went to him. 
In such a case, every wtnnan reseinhles Mahomet. Aik! then, oddly 
enough, the first sym|)toni of jrue love in a ytnmg man is timidity, 
in a young woman, boldness, dliis is snrprisiiig, and yt*i noiliing is 
more natural It is the two sexes tending to unite, and each acquiring 
the qualities of tlie other. 

That day Cosettc/s glance made Marius mad, Marius* glance 
made Cosette tremble, Mariu-s Wi*ni away comident, and Cosette 
anxious. hVom that day t»invard, tliey adi»reii each other. 

The first thing that tM.^eite felt was a \ a;.pu' yet &lt;leep sadness. It 
seemed to her that sinc&lt;* yeslervlay her smd had become black. She 
no longer recognised herself, d'lie whitene-.s of soul of yemng girls, 
which is ctmijjosed id coldness and e,aiety, is like snow. It melts 
before love, which is its sun. 

Cosette tlid not know what lt»ve was. She had never heard the 
wonl uttered in its earthly seitNe, in the books of piajfane music 
which came into die convent, o/no.ar wa^ rejilaced by iiiuthour, or 
This made pn/^des which eMaad .ed die imagination of the 
gweat girls, such as: Oft! hair t/./sAaeba/ /.v f/ic ooadso/r/ or: Ptiy

fore, what namt* to give lu what sla* now e\j»miencetl Is one less 
sick for not kimwing the tKiine of the di^a a^e ? 

She loved with so much the more paedon a i site loved with igntv 
ranee. She ditl not loimv wiietberji were good or evil, beneficent or 
dangenms. mrv&gt;^nvy or mvidemah eternal or fr;msitury, permitted

distant and dwelling in the ideal, a chimera having a form. Any 
closer and more palpable encounter would at this first period have 
terrified Cosette, still half buried in the magnifying mirage of the 
cloister. She had all the terrors of children and all the terrors of 
nuns commingled. The spirit of the convent, with which she had 
been imbued for five years, was still slowly evaporating from her 
whole person, and made everything tremulous about her. In this 
condition, it was not a lover that she needed, it was not even an ad- 
mirer, it was a vision. She began to adore Marius as something 
charming, luminous, and impossible. 

^ As extreme artlessness meets extreme coquetry, she smiled upon 
him, very frankly. 

She waited impatiently every day the hour for her walk, she 
found Marius there, she felt herself inexpressibly happy, and sin- 
cerely believed that she uttered her whole thought when she said 
to Jean Valjean; “What a delightful garden the Luxembourg is!” 

Marius and Cosette were in the dark in regard to each other. They 
did not speak, they did not bow, they were not acquainted ; they saw 
each other ; and, like the stars in the sky separated by millions of 
leagues, they lived by gazing upon each other. 

Thus it was that Cosette gradually became a woman, and beauti- 
ful and loving, grew with conscibusness of her beauty, and in ig- 
"Arance of her love. Coquettish withal, through innocence. 


VII 

TO SADNESS, SADNESS AND A HALF 

Lvery condition has its instinct. The old and eternal mother. Nature, 
silently warned Jean Valjean of the presence of Marius. Jean Val- 
jean shuddered in the darkest of his mind. Jean Valjean saw noth- 
ing, knew nothing, but still gazed with persistent fixedness at the 
darkness which surrounded .him, as if he perceived on one side 
something which was building, and on the other something which 
was falling down. Marius, also warned, and, according to the deep 
law of God, by this same mother, Nature, did all that he could to 
hide himself from the “father.” It happened, however, that Jean 
Valjean sometimes perceived him. Marius’ ways were no longer at 
all lutural. He had an equivocal prudence and an awkward bold- 
ness. He ceased to come near them as formerly; he sat down at a 
distance, and remained there in an ecstasy; he had a bdok'and pre- 
tended to be reading ; why did he pretend ? Formerly he came with 
his old coat, now he had his new coat on ever^r day ; it was not very 
certain that he did not curl his hair, he had strange eyes, he wore 
gloves ; in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man. 

Cosette gave no ground for suspicion. Without knowing exactly

and that it innst l»c cnnecaluL 

There was between the taste fi.*r dress wliich, had arisen in Cosette 
and the habit of wearing' new enats which had .i^rnwn npnn this un- 
known man, a parallelism which made Jea!i V^aljiMu anxious. It 
was an accident perhaps, doubtless, certainly, Imt a Ihreaienimy 
accident. ^ ^ 

lie had never opened his mouth to liosette about the unknown 
man. One day, iiowever, he couM not c&lt;tntain himself, and with ihat 
uncertain despair which hastily drops the |&gt;lurninet into its uiv 
happiness, lie said to her: *‘\\ iiat a pedantic air tluit .v&lt;nnig man

Cosette, a year before, an nnconcernefl Httk* would have an-

intoxicated Marius, who perceived nothing but that, and now saw 
nothing, in the world save one radiant, adored face, Jean Valjean 
fixed upon Marius glaring and terrible eyes. He who had come to 
believe that he was no longer capable of a malevolent feeling, had 
moments in which, when Marius , was there, he thought that he was 
again beconiing savage and ferocious, and felt opening and up- 
heaving against this young man those old depths of his soul where 
there had once been so much wrath. It seemed to him almost as if 
the unknown craters were forming within him again. 

What? he was there, that creature. What did he come for? He 
came to pry, to scent, to examine, to attempt : he came to say, “Eh, 
why not?” he came to' prowl about his, Jean Valjean’s life! — to 
prowl about his happiness, to clutch it and carry it away ! 

Jean Valjean added : “'Yes, that is it! what is he looking for? an 
adventure? What does he want? an amour! An amour! — ^and as 
for me ! What ! I, after having been the most miserable of men, 
shall be the most unfortunate ; I shall have spent sixty years of life 
upon my knees ; I shall have suffered all that a man can suffer ; I 
shall have grown old without having been young; I shall have 
lived with no family, no relatives, no friends, no wife, no children! 
I shall nave left my blood on every stone, on every thorn, on dyery 
post, along every wall ; I shall have been mild, although the world was 
harsh to me, and good, although it was evil ; I shall have become an 
honest man in spite of all ; I shall have repented of the wrong which 
I have done, and pardoned the wrongs which have been done to me, 
and the moment that I am rewarded, the moment that it is over, the 
moment that I reach the end, the moment that I have what I de- 
sire, rightfully and justly ; I have paid for it, I liave earned it ; it will 
all disappear, it will all vanish, and I shall lose Cosette, and I shall 
lose my life, my joy, my soul, because a great booby has been pleased 
to come and lounge about the Luxembourg," 

Then his eyes filled with a strange_ and dismal light. It was no 
longer a man looking upon a man;, it was not an enemy looking 
upon an enemy. It was a dog looking upon a robber. 

We know the rest. The insanity of Marius continued. One day he 
followed Cosette to the Rue de I'Ouest. Another day he spoke to 
the porter: the porter in his turn spoke, and said to Jean Valjean: 
“Monsieur, who is that curious young man who has been asking for 
you?” The next day, Jean Valjean cast that glance at Marius which 
Marius finally perceived. A week after, Jean Valjean had moved. 
He resolved that he would never set his foot again either in the 
Luxembourg, or in the Rue de TOuest. He returned to the Rue 
Plumet. ' 

Cosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no ques* 
tions, she did not seek to know any reason; she was already at that 
point at which one fears discovery and self-betrayal. Jean Valjean 



760 I. E S M I S ft K A 11 1. K S 

had no experience of this niiserv, the only misery which is charm- 
ing, and the only misery wliieli he did net know; for this reason 
he did not understand the deep signiiieanee of Cnsette’s silence He 
noticed only that she had hefinrie sad, and lie heeume glnoniy. There 
was on either side an armed inexperience. 

Once he made a trial. Me askeil t. use! t e : 

“Woulil you like to go to the laixemliunrg ?" 

A light iiliimined (.'u.selte'.s pale face. 

‘;\’es,” said she. 

They went. Three months had passed. Marius went there no 
longer. Marius was ni»t tliere. 

The next day, Jean Valjean asked again: 

t'Would you like to go to ilie I .nsemhourg ?" 

She answereil sadh’ and quiet 1\ : 

“No!" 

Jean Valjt'.an was hint hy this sadni»;-,, ami Imrrowed hy this 
gentleness. 

What w:is taking plaee in this sjiirit so young, am! alrea(I\« so 
inipeiietralile? What was in coiir-e of atcomiili -hmeiif in it ? what 
wa,s happi'iiing to Coselle’s soil!:’ .Sometimes, instead of going to 
lieu, jean t'aljcaii sat !*y his hed ,ide with his head in his hamls, and 
he spent whole nights a-king hinoelf; “\\ h.al i-. tlieie in taisiitte’s

Oh! in those lionrs, wluti monnitnl looks h,. ttirneii' towards the

Sljlj tiofhing of this was exhihitrd towards Cosetle: neither

Jean V.aljean’.s nwimer was more fender and more jiaterna! tlwn

SAINT DENIS 761 

Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette’s tacit consent. She regretted it. 
It was too late. The day she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius 
was no longer there. Marius then had disappeared; it was all over; 
what could she do? Would she ever find him again? She felt a con- 
striction of her heart, which nothing relaxed, and which was increas- 
ing every day ;_she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer, 
sunshine or rain, whether the birds sang, whether it was the season 
for dahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more rbarmTng 
than the Tuileries, whether the linen which the washerwoman 
bi-ought home was starched too much, or not enough, whether Tous- 
saint did “her marketing” well or ill; and she became dejected, ab- 
sorbed, intent upon a single thought, her eye wild and fixed, as when 
one looks into the night at the deep black place where an apparition 
has vanished. 

Still she did not let Jean Valjean see anything, except her pale- 
ness. She kept her face sweet for him. 

This paleness was more than sufficient to make Jean Valjean 
anxious. Sometimes he asked her : 

“What is the matter with you ?” 

She answered: 

“Nothing.” 

And after a silence, as she felt that he was sad also, she continued : 

“And you, father, is not something the matter with you?” 

“Me ? nothing,” said he. 

These two beings, who had loved each other so exclusively, and 
with so touching a love, and who had lived so long for each other, 
were now suffering by each other, and through each other ; without 
speaking of it, without harsh feeling, and smiling the while. 


viii 

THE CHAIN 

The more unhappy of the two was Jean Valjean. Youth, even in 
its sorrows, always has a brilliancy of its own. 

At certain moments, Jean Valjean suffered so much that he be- 
came puerile. It is the peculiarity of grief to bring out the childish 
side of man. He felt irresistibly that Cbsette was escaping him. He 
would have been glad to put forth an effort, to hold her fast, to 
rouse her enthusiasm by something external and striking. These 
ideas, puerile, as we have jvtst said, and at the same time senile, 
gave him by their very childishness a just idea of the influence of 
gewgaws over the imagination of young girls. He chanced once to 
see a general’ pass in the street on horseback in full uniform. Count 
Coutard, Commandant of Paris. He envied this gilded man, hf 
thought what happiness it would be to be able to put on that coat 



762 L E S M I S 6 K A n L E s 

which was an incontestable thinj;, that if Cosette saw him thus it 
would dazzle her, that when he should give his arm to Cosette and 
pass before the gate of the Tuilcries lliey would present arms to him 
and that tliat would so satisfy Cosette that it would destroy her in- 
clination to look at the young meJi. 

An unexpected shock came to him in the midst of these sad 
thoughts. 

In the isolated life which they were leading, and since they had 
come to live in the Rue Plumet, they liad formed a habit. Th^ 
sometimes made a pleasure excursion to go and see the sun "rise a 
gentle joy suited to those who are entering upon life and those who 
are leaving it. 

A walk at early dawn, to him who h)ves solitude, is equivalent to 
a walk at night, with the gaiety of nature a&lt;l(Utd, The streets are 
empty and the birds art^ singing. Cosette, herself a bird, usually 
awoke early. These luoniiiig excursions were arranged the evening 
before. lie proiwsed, she accepted. 'I'liey wer&lt;' planned as a con- 
spiracy, they went out before day. and tlil-se were so many pleasant 
hours for Cosette. Such innocent eccentricities have a charm for 
the yoting. 

Jean Valjean's inclination was, we know, to go to unfrequented 
, spots, ^ to solitary no(jks, to iiegfectei! pltices. '{'here were at that 
time in the iieighlsnirhtMKl «,tf the hm-rieres of Paris some poor 
fields, almost in the city, where there grew in snniiner a .scanty crop 
of wheat, ami which iii autumn, after this w:is gathered, apjwared 
not to have been harvested, hut stripped, jean Valjean had a pre- 
dilection f&lt;3r these fields. Cosette did iiot'dislike them. To him it 
wa.s .solitude, to her it was lilH-rty. There she became a little girl 
again, she could run and almost play, she look off her hat, laid it on 
Jean Valjean’s knee.s, ami gathered ilowers. She Imiked at the but- 
terflies upon the blossoms, hut did not catch them; gentleness and 
tenderness are liorn wiilt love, and the voting girl who 1ms in her 
heart a trembling and fragile idea, feels pity for a butterfly’s wing. 
She wove garlands of wild jvtpities wlii«'h .sh&lt;* jtut Ufx^n fier head, 
snd which, lit up and ilhiininated in flte sunshine, and blazing like 
a flame, made a crtjwn of iiw* for her fresli and rosy face. 

Even after their life had hecit siiddenetl, they contitiuetl their habit 
of morning walks, 

.So one October morning, templed liy the deep .serenity of the 
autumn of 18.11. thev had gniu* out, and found themselves at day- 
bwak near the Rarrii^re dii Maine, It was not day, it was dawn; a 
wild and ravi.shing nwment. A few eonstellation.s’here and there in 
the deep pale heaven.s, the earth all black, the slgr all white, a shiver- 
ing in the spears of gras.s, everywhere the mysterious thrill of the 
twilight. A lark, whiclt .seemed among the stars, was singing at this 
enormous height, and one would have said tlwtt this hymn from 



SAINT DENIS 763 

littleness to the infinite was calming the immensity. In the east 
the Val de Grace carved out upon the clear horizon, with the sharp- 
ness of steel, its obscure mass ; Venus was rising in splendour be- 
hind that dome like a soul escaping from a dark edifice. 

All was peace and silence; nobody upon the highway; on the 
footpaths a few scattered working-men, hardly visible, going to 
their work, 

Jean Val jean was seated in the side walk, upon some timbers lying 
by the gate of a lumber-yard. He had his face turned towards the 
road, and his back towards the light ; he had forgotten the sun which 
was just rising; he had fallen into one of those deep rneditations in 
which the whole mind is absorbed, which even imprison the senses, 
and which are equivalent to four walls. There are some meditations 
which may be called vertical ; when one is at the bottom it takes time 
to return to the surface of the earth, Jean Valjean had descended 
into one of these reveries. He was thinking of Cosette, of the hap- 
piness possible if nothing came between her and him, of that light 
with which she filled his life, a light which was the atmosphere of 
his soul. He was almost happy in his reverie. Cosette, standing near 
him, was watching the clouds as they became ruddy. 

Suddenly, Cosette exclaimed : ^‘Father, I should think somebody 
was coming down there.’' Jean Valjean looked up. 

Cosette was right. 

The highway which leads to the ancient Barriere du Maine is a 
prolongation! as everybody knows, of the Rue de Sevres, and is in- 
tersected at a right angle by the interior boulevard. At th^ corner 
of the highway and the boulevard, at the point where they diverge, 
a sound was heard, difficult of explanation at such an hour, and a 
kind of moving confusion appeared. Some shapeless thing which 
came from the boulevard was entering upon the highway. ■ 

It grew larger, it seemed to move in order, still it was bristling 
and quivering; it looked like a waggon, but they could not make 
out the load. There were horses, wheels, cries ; whips were cracking. 
By degrees the features became definite, although enveloped in dark- 
ness. It was in fact a waggon which had just turned out of the boule- 
vard into the road, and which was making its way towards the 
barriere, near which Jean Valjean was ; a second, of the same ap- 
pearance, followed it, then a third, then a fourth ; seven vehicles 
turned in in succession, the horses’ heads touching the rear of the 
waggons. Dark forms were moving upon these waggons, flashes 
were seen in the twilight as if of drawn swords, a clanking was heard 
which resembled the rattling of chains; it advanced, the voices 
grew louder, and it was as terrible a *hing as comes forth from the 
•avern of dreams. 

As it approached it took form, and outlined itself behind the trees 
with the pallor of an apparition ; the mass whitened ; daylight, which 



764 I. E S M I S E K A B I. E S 

was rising little by little, spread a palid gleam over this crawling 
thing, which was at once sepulchral atid alive, the heads of the 
shadows became the faces of corpses, ami it was this ; 

Seven waggons were moving in llle upon the road. Six of them 
were of a peculiar structure, they resembled coopers’ drays ; they 
were a sort of long ladder placed upon two wlieels, forming thills 
at the forward end. Each dray, or better, each ladder, was drawn 
by four horses tandem. Upon these ladders strange clusters of men 
were carried. In the little light that thc-re was, these men were not 
seen, they were only guessed. Twenty- four on each waggon, twelve 
on each side, back to back, their faces towards the passers-by, their 
legs hanging down, these men were travelling thus; and they had 
behind them something whicli clanked and which was a chain, and 
at their necks something which shone and wlrch was an iron collar. 
Each had his collar, but the chain was for all ; so that these twenty- 
four men, if they should chance to get down from the dray and 
walk, would be made subject to -'i sort of_ ine.\orahle unity, and 
have to wiggle over the ground with the chain for :i backbone, very 
much like centipedes. In front and rear of each waggon, two men, 
armed with muskets, stood, each having an end of tlie chain under 
his foot. The collars were square. I’hi: seventh waggon, a huge cart 
with racks, but without a cover, hml four wheels and six horses, 
and carried a resounding ])ile of iron kettles, melting puts, furnaces, 
and chains, over which were .scattered ;i nuinher of men, who were 
bound and lying at fttll length, and who_appeare&lt;i to Ue sick. This 
cart, entirely expo-sed to view, was furnished with broken hurdles 
which seemed to have served in the ancient punishments. 

These waggons kept the middle of the street. At either side 
inarched a row of guards of infamou.s appearance, wearing three- 
pronged hats like the soldiers of tin; l3irertory, slaiin'd, torn, filthy, 
muffled up in Invalitles’ uniforms aiul hearst'-hoys’ trousers, half 
grey and lial f blue, almost in tatters, with red epaulets, yellow cross- 
bdt.s, sheath-knive.s, muskets, and dubs: a spt'cies of servant-sol- 
diers. These shirri seetned a componiKl of the .ahjeelness of the beg- 
gar and the authority of the executioner. 'I'lie one who appeared to 
he their chief had a fiorsewhip in his hainl. All tliese jletails, blurred 
by the twilight, were beconting clearer ami clearer in the growing 
light. At the head and tlu; rear of the convoy, gendarmes marched 
on honseljack, .solemn, and with tlrawn swor&lt;ls. 

I'itis cortege was .so long that when the first waggon reached the 
harriere, tlie last had hardly tfirned out of thi* boulevard. 

A crowd, come from noluKly knows where, .nnd gathered in a 
twinkling, as is frequently the ca.Sf in Paris, were pu.shing along 
the two sides of tlie highway ami Io(*king on. In the neighbouring 
lanes there were heard people .shouting and calling each other, and 
the wooden .shoes of the market gardener.s who were running to see. 



SAINTDENIS 765 

The men heaped upon the drays were silent as they were jolted 
along. They were livid with the chill of the morning. They all had 
tow trousers, and their bare feet were in wooden shoes. The rest 
of their costume was according to the fancy of misery. Their dress 
was hideously variegated : nothing is more dismal than the harle- 
quin of rags. Felt hats jammed out of shape, glazed caps, horrible 
cloth caps, and beside the linen monkey-jacket, the black coat out at 
the elbows ; several had women’s hats ; others had baskets on their 
heads ; hairy breasts could be seen, and through the holes in their 
clothing tattooings could be discerned; temples of love, burning 
hearts, cupids, eruptions, and red sores could also be seen. Two or 
three had a rope of straw fixed to the bars of the dray, and hung 
beneath them like a stirrup, which sustained their feet. One of them 
held in his hand and carried to his mouth something which looked 
like a black stone, which he seemed to be gnawing ; it was bread 
which he was eating. There were none but dry eyes among them ; 
thev were rayless, or lighted with an evil light. The troop of escort 
was cursing, the chained did not whisper ; from time to time there 
was heard the sound of the blow of a club upon their shoulders or 
their heads ; some of these men were yawning ;• their rags were ter- 
rible; their feet hung down, their shoulders swung, their heads 
struck together, their irons rattled, their eyes glared fiercely, their 
fists were clenched or open inertly like the hands of the dead ; behind 
the convoy a troop of children were bursting with laughter. 

This file waggons, whatever it was, was dismal. It was evident 
that to-morrow, that in an hour, a shower might spring up, that it 
would be followed by another, and another, and that the worn-out 
clothing would be soaked through, that once wet, these men would 
never get dry, that once chilled, they would never get warm again, 
that their tow trousers would be fastened to their skin by the rain, 
that water would fill their wooden shoes, that blows of the whip 
could not prevent the chattering of their jaws, that the chain would 
continue to hold them by the neck, that their feet would continue 
to swing; and it was impossible not to shudder at seeing these 
human creatures thus bound and passive under the chilling clouds 
of autumn, and given up to the rain, to the wind, to all the fury of 
the elements, like trees and stones. 

The clubs did not spare even the sick, who lay tied with ropes and 
motionless in the seventh waggon, and who seemed to have been 
thrown there like sacks filled with misery. 

Suddenly, the sun appeared; the immense radiance of the Orient 
burst forth, and one would have said that it set all these savage heads 
Oil fire. Their tongues were loosed, a conflagration of sneers, of 
oaths, and songs burst forth. The broad horizontal light cut the 
whole file in two, illuminating their heads and their bodies, leaving 
their feet and the wheels in the dark. Their thoughts appeared upon 



766 LES MISERABI.ES 

tlicir f 3.CCS y tliG moment W3.s tipp^lling^ , demons visible with their 
mnslcs fSrlien off, ferocious souls l«iid bure. Lighted up, this ^roup 
was still dark. Some, who were gay, had quills in their mouths from 
which they blew vermin among the crowd, selecting the women ; the 
dawn intensified these mournful profiles by tlie blackness of the 
shade; not one of these beings who was not deformed by misery; 
and it was so monstrous that one would have said that it changed the 
sunbeams into the gleam of the lightning’s flash. The waggon load 
which led the cortege had struck up and were singing at the top of 
their voices with a ghastly joviality a medley of Desaugiers, then 
famous, la Vestale; the trccs shivered cirearily on the side walks, 
the bourgeois listened with faces of idiotic bliss to these obscenities 

chanted by spectres. ■ . , . , 

Every form of distress was present in tins chaos of a cortege; 
there was the facial angle of every beast, old men, youths, bald heads, 
grey beards, cynical moicstrusitics, ilogged resignation, savage 
grimaces, insane attitudes, snouts set-off with caps, heads like those 
of young girls with corlcscrews over their temples, child faces hor- 
rifying bn that account, thin skeleton faces which lacked nothing 
but death. On the first waggon wa.s a negro, who, perhaps, had been 
a slave and could compare chains. 'I'ho fearful leveller, disgrace, had 
passed over these brows ; at tliis degree, of abasement the last trans- 
formation had taken place in all of its iitino.st degree ; and ignorance, 
changed into stupidity, wa.s the eiiiiril of intelligence changed into 
despair. No i»ssib!e choice among the.se men who seemed by their 
appearance the elite of the mire. It was clear that the marshal, who- 
ever he was, of this foul procession had not classified them. These 
beings had been bound and coupled ptdl-mell, iirohably in alphabetic 
disorder, and loaded haphazard upon these waggons. The aggrega- 
tion of horrors, however, alway.s cuds liy evolving a resultant ; every 
addition of misfortune gives a total : there came from each chain a 
common soul, and each cartload ha&lt;l its own jihysiognomy. Beside 
the one which was singing, there was one wliich was howling; a 
third was begging ; one was .seen gnashing his tedh ; another was 
threatening the bystanders, anotlter lilasplieming ( lOtl ; the last wa.s 
silent as the tomb. Dante would have thought he .saw the seven cir- 
cles of ilcll on their passtige. 

A passage from coiidiinnation pnnisiiiiiciit, made drear- 

ily, not upon the formi&lt;Iahle flashing car of the .A.piicalypse, but more 
dismal still upon a hangman’s cart. 

One of the guard, who had a hot)k on the end of his club, from 
time to time in;u!e a semblance of stirring up this h«&gt;ap of human 
onliire. An ohl woman in the crowd ijointed them out with her finger 
to a little hoy five years old. and .said : "Wlwlp, that ivill tmeh you!’ 

As the songs and the blasphemy increased, he who seemed the 
captain of the escort cracked his whio. and iijion that signal, a fear-

ful, sullen, and promiscuous cudgelling, which sounded like hail, 
fell upon the seven waggons; many roared and foamed; which re- 
doubled the joy of the gamins who had collected, a swarm of flies 
upon these wounds. 

Jean Valjean’s eye had become frightful. It was no longer, an 
eye ; it was that deep window, which takes the place of the look in 
certain unfortunate beings, who seem unconscious of reality, and 
from which flashes out the reflection of horrors and catastrophes. 
He was not looking upon a sight ; a vision was appearing to him. He 
endeavoured to rise, to flee, to escape ; he could not move a lim b. 
Sometimes things which you see, clutch you and hold you. He was 
spell-bound, stupefied, petrified, asking himself, through a vague 
unutterable anguish, what was the meaning of this sepulchral per- 
secution, and whence came this pandemonium wliich was pursuing 
him. All at once he raised his hand to his forehead, a common gesture 
with those to whom memory suddenly returns ; he remembered that 
this was really the route, that this detour was usual to avoid meeting 
the king, which was always possible on the Fontainebleau road, and 
that, thirty-five years before, he had passed through this barriere. 

Cosette, though from another cause, was equallv terrified. She 
did not comprehend ; her breath failed her ; what she saw did not 
seem possible to her ; at last she exclaimed : 

“Father ! what can there be in those waggons ?” 

Jean Valj ean answered : 

“Convicts.” 

“And where are they going ?” 

“To the galleys.” 

At this moment the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, 
reached its climax; blows with the flat of the sword joined in; it 
was a fury of whips and clubs ; the galley slaves crouched down, a 
hideous obedience was produced by the punishment, and all were 
silent with the look of cliained wolves. Cosette trembled in every 
limb ; she continued : 

“Father, are they still men ?” 

“Sometimes,” said the wretched man. 

It was in fact the chain which, setting out before day from Bicetre, 
took the Mans road to avoid Fontainebleau, where the king then 
was. This detour made the terrible journey last three or four days 
longer ; but to spare the royal person the sight of the punishment, 
it may well be prolonged. 

Jean Valj ean returned home overwhelmed. Such encounters are 
shocks, and the memory which they leave resembles a convulsion. 

Jean Valjean, however, on the way back to the Rue de Babylone. 
with Cosette, did not notice that she asked him other questions re- 
garding what they had just seen; perhaps be was himself too much' 
absorbed in his own dejection to heed her words or to answer them. 



768 LES MISERABLES 

But at night, as Cosette was leaving him to go to bed, he heard hei 
say in an undertone, and as if talking to herself : “It seems to me 
that if I should meet one of those men in my path, O my God, I 
should die just from seeing him near me !” 

Fortunately it happened that on the morrow of this tragic day 
there were, in conscquonce of some official celebration, fetes in Paris 
a review in the Champ de Mars, rowing matches upon the Seine' 
theatricals in the Champs Elysees, fireworks at I’Etoile, illumi- 
nations everywhere, jean Valjcan, doing violence to his habits, took 
Cosette to these festivities, for the purpose of diverting her 'mind 
from the memories of the day before, and of effacing under the 
laughing tumult of all Paris, the abominable tiling which had passed 
before her. The review, which enlivened the fete, made the display 
of uniforms quite natural ; Jean Valjean put on his National Guard 
uniform with the vague injerior feeling of a man who is taking 
refuge. Yet the object of this walk .seemed attained. Cosette, whose 
law it was to plca.se her father, and for whom, moreover, every sight 
was new, .accepted the diversion with the easy and blithe grace of 
youth, and did not look too di.sdaiiifully tqiun th:it promi.scuous bowl 
of joy which is called a puhlie fete; .so that jean N'aljcan could be- 
lieve that he had succeeded, and that no trace remaiiu:d of the hideous 
vision. 

Some days latw, one morning, when the sun was bright, and they 
were both upon the garden steps, another infraction of the rules 
W’hich jean Valjean seemed to have inipo.scd upon himself, and of 
the habit of .staying in her room which .sittlnes.'; h:id imiiosed upon 
Cosette, Cosette, in her dressing-gown, was staiuling in that undress 
of the morning hour which is charmingly liecoming to young girls, 
and which has the appearance of a cloud'npon a star ; and, with her 
httad in the light, ro.sy from having slejit well, under the lender gaze 
of the gentle goodman. site wa.s picking a daisy in pieces. Cosette 
was ignorant of the transporting legend. I hvt' ihiw a little, passion- 
ately, etc.; who should have ttiught it to her? .She was fingering 
thi.s flower, by instinct, innoeently, withonl susiiecting tiuit to pick 
a daisy in jiieces is to pluck a lieart Wbu-e there a fourth Grace named 
Melancholy, and were it smiling, site would have seemed that Grace, 

Jean Valjean was fa.seinated by the coiitefiiplation of her slender 
finger.s uiton that flower, forgetting evervihiiig in tlie radiance of this 
child. A redbreast was twittering in ihe .siiruhhery lieside them. 
V^'hitc clouds were crossing the sky so gaily that one would have .said 
they had just heen set at lilHTly. Cosette continmsl {ticking her 
flower attentively; she seemed to be thinking of something; but 
that must have lieen pleasant, .Stuklenly she lnrne&lt;i her heatl over

Valjean : “Father, what are they theji, the galley slaves ?’’

WOUND WITHOUT^ CURE WITHIN 

Thus their life gradually darkened. 

There was left to them but one distraction, and this had formerly 
been a pleasure : that was to carry bread to those who were hungry, 
and clothing to those who were cold. In these visits to the poor, in 
which Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean, they found some 
remnant of their former lightheartedness; and, sometimes, when 
they had had a good day, when many sorrows had been relieved and 
many little children revived and made warm, Cosette, in the eve- 
ning, was a little gay. It was at this period that they visited the 
Jondrette den. 

The day after that visit, Jean Valjean appeared in the cottage in 
the morning, with his ordinary calmness, but with a large wound on 
his left arm, very much inflamed and very venomous, which re- 
sembled a burn, and which he explained in some fashion. This wound 
confined him within doors more than a month with fever. He would 
see no physician. When Cosette urged it : '‘Cal! the dog-doctor,'' said 
he. 

Cosette dressed it night and mioming with so divine a grice and 
so angelic a pleasure in being useful to him, that Jean Valjean felt 
all his old happiness return, his fears and his anxieties dissipate, 
and he looked upon Cosette, saying : ‘^Oh 1 the good wound ! Qh ! the 
kind hurt !" 

Cosette, as her father was sick, had deserted the summer-house 
and regained her taste for the little lodge and the back-yard. She 
spent almost all her time with Jean Valjean, and read to him the 
books which he liked. In general, books of travels. Jean Valjean 
was born anew ; his happiness revived with inexpressible radiance ; 
the Luxembourg, the unknown young prowler, Cosette's coldness, 
all these clouds of his soul faded away. He now said to himself : 
‘T imagined all that. I am an old f ooh" 

His happiness was so great, that the frightful discovery of the 
Thenardiers, made in the Jondrette den, and so unexpectedly^ had 
in some sort glided over him. He had succeeded in escaping; his 

769 



770. LESMIS:&amp;RABI. KS 

trace was lost, whit mattered the rest ! he thought of it only to grieve 
over those wretches. “They are now in jirison, and can do no harm 
in future,” thought he, “but what a pitiful family in distress!” 

As to the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine, Cosette had 
never mentioned it again. 

At the convent, Sister Sainte Mcchthilde had taught Cosette 
music. Cosette had the voice of ti warbler with a soul, and some- 
times in the evening, in the humble kKlging of the wounded man, she 
sang plaintive songs which rejoiced Jean Valjcan. 

Spring came, the garden was .so wonderful^ at that season of the 
year, that Jean Valjcan said to Cosette: “You never go there, I 
wish you would walk in it.” “As }’ou will, father,” said Cosette. 

And, out of obedience to her father, she resumed her walks in the 
garden, oftenest alone, for, as we have remarked, Jean Valjean, who 
probably dreaded being .seen through the gate, hardly ever went 
there. 

Jean Valjean’s wound had been a diversion.^ 

When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, and that he 
was getting well, and that he seemed happy, she felt a contentment 
that .she did not even notice, .so gently and naturally did it come upon 
Iwr. It was then tlic month of Alarch, the days were growing longer, 
winter was departing, winter always carries with it something of 
our sadness ; (hen .'\]}ril came, that day!)reak &lt;rf summer, fresh like 
every dawn, gay like every childhood ; weeping a little sometimes 
like the infant that it is. Nature in this montii has charming gleams 
which pass from the sky, the claud.s, the trees, tlie fields, and the 
flowers, into the heart of man. 

Cosette wa.s still too young for this April joy, which resembled 
her, not to find its way to her heart. lnsen.sih!y, and without a sus- 
picion on her part, the darkness pas.s&lt;&gt;d away from her mind. In the 
spring it becomes light in .sad souls, a.s at noon it becomes light in 
cellars. And Cosette wa.s not now very sad. .So it was, however, but 
she did not notice it. In the njorning, aljout ten o'eliKk, after break- 
fast, when .she had .succeeded in enticing her father into the garden 
for a quarter of an hour, and wlule she was walking in the sun in 
front of the steps, suj&gt;j3orting his wi*un&lt;led ann, .she &lt;Ud not perceive 
that she was laughing every moment, atid tlut she was happy. 

Jean Valjean saw her, witlv intoxication, again become fresh and 
rosy. 

“Oh ! the blessed wound !” reiwated he in a whisper. 

And he was grateful to the Theiiardiers. 

As soon as his wound was cured, he resumed his solitary and twi- 
light walks. 

It would l)e a mistake to heliwe that one can walk in this way alone 
5n the uninliabited regions of Paris, and not meet with some’adven- 
tare.

MOTHER PLUTARCH IS NOT EMBARRASSED ON THE EXPLANATION OP 

A PHENOMENON 

One evening little Gavroche had had no dinner ; he remembered 
that he had had no dinner also the day before ; this was becoming 
tiresome. He resolved that he would try for some supper. He went 
wandering about beyond La Salpetriere, in the deserted spots ; those 
are the places for good luck ; where there is nobody, can be found 
something. He came to a settlement which appeared to him to be 
the village of Austerlitz. 

In one of his preceding strolls, he had noticed an old garden there 
haunted by an old man and an old woman, and in this garden a passa- 
ble apple tree. Beside this apple tree, there was a sort of fruit-loft 
poorly inclosed where the conquest of an apple might be made. An 
apple is a supper ; an apple is life. What ruined Adam might save 
Gavroche. The garden was upon a solitary lane unpaved and bor- 
dered with bushes for lack of houses ; a hedge separated it from the 
lane. 

Gavroche directed his steps towards the garden; he found the 
lane, he recognised the apple tree, he verified the fruit-loft, he ex- 
amined the hedge ; a hedge is a stride. Day was declining, not a cat 
in the lane, the time was good. Gavroche sketched out the escalade, 
then suddenly stopped. Somebody was talking in the garden. Gav- 
roche looked through one of the openings of the hedge. 

Within two steps of him, at the foot of the hedge on the other 
side, precisely at the point where the hole he was meditating would 
have taken him, lay a stone which made a kind of seat, and on this 
seat the old man of the garden was sitting with the old woman 
standing before him. The old woman was muttering. Gavroche, who 
was anything but discreet, listened. 

“Monsieur Mabeuf said the old woman. 

“Mabeuf !” thought Gavroche, “that is a funny name.” 

The old man who was addressed made no motion. The old woman 
repeated : 

“Monsieur Mabeuf.” 

The old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, deter- 
mined to answer : 

“What, Mother Plutarch ?” 

“Mother Plutarch !” thought Gavroche, “another funny name.” 

Mother Plutarch resumed, and the old man was forced to enter 
into the conversation : 

“The landlord is dissatisfied.” 

“Why so?” 

“There are three quarters due.” 



772 ■ L E S M 1 S K K A in. E s 

“In three months there will he Initr.” 

“He says he will turn you out of doors to sleep.” 

“I shall go.” 

“The grocery woman wauls to l,&gt;e jjaid. She holds on to her wood. 
What will you keep warm with this winter ? \Vc shall have no wood.” 

“There is the sun.” 

“The butcher refuses credit, lie will not give us any more meat.” 

“That is all right. I do not digi-sl meat well. It is too heavy.” 

“Wliat shall we have for dinner ?” 

“Bread.” 

“The baker demands something on account, and says no money, 
no bread.” 

“Very well.” 

“What will you eat ?" 

“We have the apitles from the apple tree." 

“But, monsieur, we can't live like that without money.” 

“I have not any.” 

Theohl woman went away, the oh 1 Tiian remained alone. He begat* 
to reflect. Gavroclie was retUviing on bis sitle. It was almost night. 

The first result of Gavroclie's refleetinn %vas that instead of climb- 
ing over the hedge he erepl tinder. The hranclies separated a little 
at the hotloin of tlie httshes. 

*‘Heigho," exclaimed tiavroche inlenuilly, “an alcove!" and he 
hid in it. He almost touched h'ather Mahettf’.s ,se:it. He heard the 
octogenarian hreatl le. 

Then, for dinner, he tried to sleep. 

Sleep of a cat, sleep witli one eye. ICvett while erotiching there 
Gavroche kept watch. 

The whiteness of the twilight sky hlanched the earth, and the 
lane made a livid line hetween two it»ws of thisky hushes. 

Suddenly, upon that whilei.ed Itavid two tliin forms appeared. 
One came hefore—the t»ther, at .some disfance, hehiiiti. 

“There are two fdknv.s," growled ( iavrocht*. 

The first form swnied .some old bourgeois fa'iit .'uui thoughtful, 
dressed mtire thaii simply, waikiitf. with tlu^ .slow [tace of an aged 
man, and taking his citse in Iht* starry ew ning. 

The second was straight, firm, and slight. It regulated its step by 
the ste|) of the fir.st ; hnt in tin; nnwitnied slowness of the gait, dex- 
terity and agility were manifest. This furni had, in addition to 
something wild "atttl startling, the whole apjiearanee of what was 
tlien called a dandy ; the hat was of the kaiest .style, the coat was 
black, well cut, proltahly of fine elotli, and closely fitted to the form. 
The head was l»*!tl up with a rohijst grace, and, timler the hat, could 
be setm in the twilight tlie pale profile ttf a young man. This profile 
had a rose in its mouth. The sccoinl form was well known to Gav- 
roche : it was MtJiuparnasse. 



S AI N T DEN I S 773 

As to the other, he could haye said nothing about it, except that 
it was an old goodman. 

Gavroche immediately applied himself to observation. 

One of these two passers evidently had designs upon the other. 
Gavroche was well situated to see the issue. The alcove had very 
conveniently become a hiding-place. 

Montparnasse hiding, at such an hour, in such a place — ^it was 
threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin's heart moved with pity for 
the old man. 

What could he do? intervene? one weakness in aid of another? 
That would be ludicrous to Montparnasse. Gavroche could not con- 
ceal it from himself that, to this formidable bandit of eighteen, the 
old man first, the child afterwards, would be but two mouthfuls. 

While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack was made, sharp and 
hideous- The attack of a tiger on a wild ass, a spider on a fly. Mont- 
parnasse, on a sudden, threw away the rose, sprang upon the old 
man, collared him, grasped him and fastened to him, and Gavroche 
could hardly restrain a cry. A moment afterwards, one of these men 
was under the other, exhausted, panting, struggling, with a knee of 
marble upon his breast. Only it was not altogether as Gavroche had 
expected. The one on the ground was Montparnasse ; the one above 
was the goodman. All this happened a few steps from Gavroche. 

The old man had received the shock and had returned it, and re- 
turned it so terribly that in the twinkling of an eye the assailant and 
assailed had changed parts. 

'^There is a brave Invalide thought Gavroche. 

And he could not help clapping his hands. But it was a clapping 
of hands thrown away. It did not reach the two combatants, absorbed 
and deafened by each other, and mingling their breath in the con- 
•test. 

There was silence. Montparnasse ceased to struggle. Gavroche 
said this aside : ''Can he be dead ?” 

The goodman had not spoken a word, nor uttered a cry. He arose, 
and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse : 

"Get up.’' 

Montparnasse got up, but the goodman held him. Montparnasse 
had the humiliated and furious attitude of a wolf caught by a sheep. 

Gavroche looked and listened, endeavouring to double his eyes 
by his ears. He was enormously amused. 

He was rewarded for his conscientious anxiety as a spectator. 
He was able to seize upon the wing the f ollowing di^ogue, which 
borrowed a strangely tragic tone from the the darkness. The good- 
man questioned. Montparnasse responded. 

"How old are you?” 

■ "Nineteen,” .. ■ . , „ . . . 

^'You are strong and well ^\^y.don’t you work?”

“It is fatiguing." 

“What is your busines.s ?” 

“Loafer.” 

“Speak seriously. Can I do anything for you? What would vou 
like to be?” ^ 

“A robber.” 

There was a silence. Tlie ol&lt;l tnan .scemt'd to Th&gt; tliinking deeply. 
He was niotionles.s, yet &lt;li&lt;l not release Mutitjiarnasse. 

From time to time the young batuiit, vigdi-nus aiul nimble, made 
tLe efforts of a beast caught in a .snare, lie gave a .spring, attempted 
a trip, twi.sted his limbs despenalely, eiideavrnjred to escai&gt;e. The old 
man did not appear to_ perceive it, .and with ,a single hand held his two 
arms with the .sovereign indilTerenee of .absolute strength. 

The old man’s reverie continued for some lime, then, looking 
steadily upon Montp.arn,asst‘, he gent ly raisei 1 his vi liee and addressed 
to him, in lh.at ohsenrily in which they were, a sort of .solemn allo- 
cution of which (iavroche ilid not lose a .syll.ahle: 

“My child, you are entering hy l.ai'iness into 1ht&gt; most laborious

pound weight. To go here rather than there will be a problem to 
solve. Any other man who wishes to go out, opens his door, it is 
done, he is out of doors. You, if you wish to go out, must pierce your 
wall. To go into the street, what does everybody do ? Everybody goes 
down the staircase ! but you, you will tear up your bed clothes, you 
will make a rope of them strip by strip, then you will pass through 
your window and you will hang on that thread over an abyss, and 
it will be at night, in the storm, in the rain, in the tempest, and, if 
the rope is too short, you will have but one way to descend, to fall. 
To fall at a venture, into the abyss, from whatever height, upon 
what? Upon whatever is below, upon the unknown. Or you will 
climb through the flue of a chimney, at the risk of burning your- 
self ; or you will crawl through a sewer, at the risk of being drowned. 
I do not speak of the holes which you must conceal, of the stones 
which you must take out and put back twenty times a day, of the 
moi'tar which you must hide in your mattress. A lock presents 
itself ; the bourgeois has in his pocket his key, made by a locksmith. 
You, if you want to pass out, are condemned to make a frightful 
masterpiece ; you will take a big sou, you will cut it into two slices ; 
with what tools ? Y ou will invent them. That is your business. Then 
you will hollow out the interior of these two slices, preserving the 
outside carefully, and you will cut all around the edge a screw- 
thread, so that they will fit closely one upon the other, like a bottom 
and a cover. The bottom and the top thus screwed together, nobody 
will suspect anything. To the watchmen, for you will be watched, it 
will be a big sou ; to yon, it will be a box. What will you put in this 
box ? A little bit of steel. A watch-spring in which you will cut teeth, 
and which will be a saw. With this .saw, as long as a pin, and hidden 
in this .sou, you will have to cut the bolt of the lock, the slide of the 
bolt, the clasp of the padlock, and the bar which you will have at 
your window, and the iron ring which you will have on your leg. 
This masterpiece finished, this prodig);' accomplished, all those 
miracles of art, of address, of skill, of patience, executed, if it comes 
to 1)6 known that you are the author, what will be your reward ? the 
dungeon. Behold your future. Idleness, pleasure, what ab);sses ! To 
do nothing is a dreary course to take, be sure of it. To live idle upon 
the substance of society 1 To be useless, that is to say, noxious ! This 
leads straight to the lowest depth of misery, 

"Woe to him who would be a parasite ! he will be vermin. Ah ! it 
is not pleasant to you to work ? Ah ! you will have but one thought ; 
to eat, and drink, and sleep in luxury. You will drink water, you will 
eat black bread, you will sleep upon a board, with irons riveted to 
your limbs, the chill of which you will feel at night upon your flesh ! 
You will break those irons, you will flee. Very 'well. You will drag 
yourself on your belly in the bushes, and eat grass like the beasts of 
the forest. And you will be retaken. And then you will spend years 



776 E S M I s E R A B I- E S 

in a dungeon, fastened to a wall, groping for a drink from your 
pitcher, gnawing a frightful loaf of (larkn&lt;;ss which the dogs would 
not touch, eating hcans which the woiins ha\c calcn before you. 
You will he a wood-louse in a cellar. Oh ! take pity on yourself, 
miserable child, young thing, a suckling not twenty years ago, who 
doubtless have a mother still alive ! I conjure you, listen to me. You 
desire fine black clothes, sbiniug pumps, to curl your hair, to put 
sweet-scented oil uixin your lucks, to please your women, to be hand- 
some. You will be close shorn, with a red coat and wooden shoes. 
You wish a ring on your finger, you will have an iron collar on your 
neck. And if you look at a woman, a blow of the dub. And you will 
go in there at twenty, and you will come out at tifty ! You will enter 
youno- rosy, fresh, with your eyes liright and all your teeth white, 
and your beautiful youtliful liair; you will come out broken, bent, 
wrinkled toothless, horrible, with white hair! Oh! my child, you 
are taking a mistaken road, laziness is giving you bad advice; the 
harde.st of all labour is robbery, 'rrust me, do not undertake this 
dreadful drudgery of being an idler. 'I'o become a rascal is not com- 
fortalile. It is not so hard to be an hoiu'st man. I lo. now, and think 
of what I have said to you. And now, wliat did you want of me? my 

purse ? here it is." . 

And the old man. releasing Montparnasse, put his purse m his 
hand, which Montparnasse \wighed f&lt; n‘ a moment : a Iter which, with 
the same mechanical precaution as if lu* Inul stokui it, klontjiarnasse 
let it glide gently into the hack pocket of his coat. 

Air this said and done, the gomlman turned his hack and quietly 
resumed his walk. 

‘'Blockhead!’’ murmured Montparnasse. 

Whn'wa.s this gnodman? the reader has doubtless guessed. 

Montparnasse, in stupefaction, watched him till he. ilisappeared 
in the twilight. 1 Ins eoiitcinjilalii'n was fatal to him. 

W'iiile llie old man was moving away, t lavruche w.as approaching. 

Gavrudie, with a side glauee, made sure that bather Maheuf, 
perhaps asleep, was still sitting .in the scat. Then the nrehin came out 
of his hushes, ami he.gan to creep along ii. the shade, behind the 
motinnless Montparnasse. He reacbi-t ' bmtparnasse thus without 
iu'ing seen or heard, gently insimiatei’ .sis hand into the hack pocket 
of the fine Itlack doth eoat, took the purse, wiiluirew his hand, and, 
creeping olT again, .glided :iw;iy like an adder into the &lt;larkne.ss. 
Montparnasse, who bad no re,nson to be iipon ins giuird, and who 
was reflecting fur the first time in bis life, jteiveived nothing of it. 
Gavrodie. wlten he had reached the jioint where batlier Mtibeuf 
was, threw the purse over the heclge, .'imi fled at full speed.

six napoleons. 

M. Mabeuf , very much startled, carried the thing to his governess. 
''This falls from the sky/' said Mother Plutarch. 



BOOK FIFTH 

THE END OF WHICH IS UNLIKE THE BEGINNING 

I 


SOLITUDE AND TIIK ItARRACKS 

Cosette's grief . so poignant still, and so arute four or five months 
before, had, without her knowledge' even, entered upon convales- 
cence. Nature, Spring, her youth, her Ittve for her father, the gaiety 
of the birds and the flowers, were filtering little by little, day by 
day, drop by drop, into this soul so jmn; ainl so young, something 
which almost resembhxl oblivion. XVtis the firt' dying out entirely? 
or was it merely becoming a bed of emlM'rs? 'i'he truth is, that .she 
had scarcely anything left of that sorrowful and consuming feeling. 

One day she suddenly thouglit of Marius : “What !" said she, “I 
do not think of him now.” 

In the course of tlmt very week she noticed, passing before the 
grated gtite of the grirden, a*very handsome &lt;4'ficer of lancers, waist 
like a wasp, ravishing uniforni, cheeks like a young girl’s, sabre 
under his arm, wa.xed moustaciies, jmlished sidtapska. Moreover, 
fair hair, full blue eye.s, plum{), vain, insolent and pretty face; the 
very apposite of Marius. A cigtir in his month, t 'osette tliought that 
this oflicer doubtless belonged to the regiment in htirracks on the Rue 
de Rahylone. 

The next day, .she saw him pass again. .She noticed the htutr. 

Dating from thl.s time, was it diaiice? sire s-aw him pass almost 
every day. 

The cifficcr’.s eomr.ades perceivxsl that tliere was, in this garden 
so “badly kept,” behind that wretched old-fasliioned grating, a 
pretty creature that always happened to he visildt: on the passage 
of the handsome lieutenant, who is not tmkmtwu t&lt;» the reader, and 
whose name was 'I'luSodiile riillenortnand. 

“Stop!" sttid they to him. “Mere is a little girl who has her eye 
upon you : why don’t you Itwk at her ?" 

“Do you suppose I iiave the time," answered the lancer, "to look 
at all the girls who lixik at me ?" 

This was the very time when Marius was descending gloomily 
towards agony, and saying: “If I could only see her again before I 
die I" Had his wish been realised, had he seen Cosette at that moment 

778 



SAINT 0ENIS 779 

looking at a lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, 
and would have expired of grief. 

Whose fault was it? Nobody’s. 

Marius was of that temperament which sinks into grief, and re- 
mains there ; Cosette was of that which plunges in, and comes out 
again. 

Cosette indeed was passing that dangerous moment, the fatal 
phase of feminine reverie abandoned to itself, when the heart of an 
isolated young girl resembles the tendrils of a vine which seize hold, 
as chance determines, of the capital of a column or the signpost of a 
tavern. A hurried and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, 
whether she be poor or whether she be rich, for riches do not defend 
against a bad choice; misalliances are formed very high; the real 
misalliance is that of souls ; and, even as more than one unknown 
young man, without name, or birth, or fortune, is a marble column 
which sustains a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas, so 
you may find a satisfied and opulent man of the world, with polished 
boots and varnished speech, who, if you look, not at the exterior 
but the interior, that is to say, at what is reserved for the wife, is 
nothing but a stupid joist, darkly haunted by violent, impure, and de- 
bauched passions ; the signpost of a tavern. 

What was there in Cosette’s soul ? A soothed or sleeping passion ; 
love in a wavering state; something which was limpid, shining, 
disturbed to a certain depth, gloomy below. The image of the hand- 
some officer was reflected from the surface. Was there a memory at 
the bottom ? deep at the bottom ? Perhaps, Cosette did not know. 

A singular incident followed. 


II 

FEARS OF COSETTE 

In the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean went on a journey. This, 
we know, happened with him from time to time, at very long inter- 
vals. He remained absent one or two days at the most. Where did 
he go ? nobody knew, not even Cosette. Once only, on one of these 
trips, she had accompanied him in a fiacre as far as the corner of a 
little cul-de-sac, on which she read : Impasse de la Planchette, There 
he got out, and the fiacre took Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone. 
It was generally when money was needed for the household expenses 
that Jean Valjean made these little journeys. 

Jean Valjean then was absent. He had said : 'T shall be back in 
three days.’* • 

In the evening, Cosette was alone in the parlour. To amuse her- 
self, she had opened her piano and began to sing, playing an accom- 



780 L E S M I S E R A R L E S 

paniment, the chorus from Euryanthe: Ilnntcrs wandering in the 
%voo(Is! which is perhaps the finest piece in all music. 

All at once it seemed to her that she heard a step in the garden. 

It could not I)e licr father, he was absent ; it could not'^be Toils- 
&lt;;aiiU, she was in bed. It was ten o’clock at night. 

She went to the window shutter which was closed and put her 
ear to it. 

It appeared to her that it was a man s st(‘i), and that he was 
treading very wSoftly, 

She ran immediately up to the first story, into her room, opened 
a slide in her blind, and Icjoked into the garilen. The moon was full 
She cottld see a.s [ilainly as in broad da}\ 

There was nt&gt;body {here. 

She opened the window. The ganleu was aI&gt;soiutely silent and all 
that she could see of the .street was as deserted as it always was. 

Cosetlo thouglit she had been mist;d&lt;en. Sin* had imagined she 
heard this noise. It was a hallucination pioduced by W’eber’s sombre 
and majestic duuais, which opens Indtua? the mind startling depths, 
which trembles lieftna; the tye like a bewildering forest, and in which 
wc hear the crackling of the dead branches beneath the anxious step 
of the hunters dimly seen in tlie twilight, 

She tliougia no more about it. 

Moreover, C oseile by nature was not easily startled. There was 
in her veins the hloiul of the gipsy a:nl ed the adventuress who goes 
bare foot. It must l&gt;e remembered she was rather a lark than a dove. 
She was wild ami brave at heart. 

The next day, not so late, at nightfall, she was walking in the 
ganlen. In the midst of (he eraifuserl tlumglus whieh fdled her mind, 
she thought she heanl for a momt'iu a s^smd like tlie sound of the 
evening before, as if somehtnly were walking in tlie darkness under 
the trees, not very ^far from her, I»ut site said to luu’self that nothing 
is more like a step lu tlie grass than the rustling of two limbs against 
each other, and she paid iiu aUeniiou to it. Morcewer, she saw noth- 
ing. 

She left **the bush f site had to t ro -s a liub* grt'en grass-plot to 
teach the steps. 1‘he moon, which had jus! yUvu iHiiiml her, pro- 
jected, as Cosettecame out frinn the shruhlicr)^ her shadow before 
her upon this grass»-pb&gt;t;. 

Coset te stood still, terrified. 

By the side of her slmtlow, the numt marked out distinctly upon 
the sward another shadow singularly frightful and terrible, a 
shadow with a round Iial. 

It was like the shadow of a man who miglu have been standing in 
the edge of the shrulihery, a few .steps behind (aisette. 

h'^or a moment she w»as unafde to .sf&gt;eak, or cry, or call, or stir, or 
:wn her head 



SAINT DEN I S 781 

At last she summoned up all her courage and resolutely turned 
round. 

There was nobody there. 

She looked upon the ground. The shadow had disappeared. 

She returned into the shrubbery, boldly hunted through the cor- 
ners, went as far as the gate, and found nothing. 

She felt her blood run cold. Was this also a hallucination ? What ! 
two days in succession ? One hallucination may pass, but two hal- 
lucinations? What made her most anxious was that the shadow 
was certainly not a phantom. Phantoms never wear round hats. 

The next day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette narrated to him 
what she thought she had heard and seen. She expected to be re- 
assured, and that her father would shrug his shoulders and say; 
^Wou are a foolish little girl.’’ 

Jean Valjean became anxious. 

'Tt may be nothing,” said he to her. 

He left her under some pretext and went into the garden, and 
she saw him examining the gate very closely. 

In the night she awoke ; now she was certain, and she distinctly 
heard somebody walking very near the steps under her window. She 
ran to her slide and opened it. There was in fact a man in the garden 
with a big club in his hand. Just as she was about to cry out, the 
moon lighted up the man’s face. It was her father ! 

She went back to bed, saying ; ^^So he is really anxious !” 

Jean Valjean passed that night in the garden and the two nights 
following. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter. 

The third night the moon was smaller and rose later, it might have 
been one o’clock in the morning, she heard a loud burst of laughter 
and her father’s voice calling her : 

^^Cosette!” 

She sprang out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened 
her window. 

Her father was below on the grass-plot. 

‘T woke you up to show you,” said he. ‘Took, here is your shadow 
in a round hat.” 

And he pointed to a shadow on the sward made by the moon, and 
which really bore a close resemblance to the appearance of a man in 
a round hat. It was a figure pi'oduced by a sheet-iron stove-pipe 
with a cap, which rose above a neighbouring roof. 

Cosette also began to laugh, all her gloomy suppositions fell to 
the ground, and the next day, while breakfasting with her father, 
she made merry over the mysterious garden haunted by shadows 
of stove-pipes. 

Jean Valjean became entirely calm again; as to Cosette, she did 
not notice very carefully whether the stove-pipe was really in the 
direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she saw, 'and 



782 L E S H I S E A B L K S 

whether the moon was in the same part of the sky. She made no 
question about the oddity of a stove-pipe which is afraid of being 
caught in the act, and which retires when you hjok at its shadow 
for the shadow had disappeared when Cusctte turned round, and 
Cosette had really believed that she was certain of that. Cosette 
was fully reassured. The demonslnilion api)eaia‘d to her complete 
and the idea that there coiilcl have been anyho&lt;ly walking in the 
garden that evening, or that night, no long&lt;M* entered her head. 

A few days afterwards however, a new incident occurred. 


in 

ENRTcnnn tuh com mf.%'tariks of toitssaint 

In the garden, near tlie grated gate, on the streti, tlu‘re was a stone 
seat prutectesl fn)ai the gax:i* of tlie eurinus Iw a hedge, hut which 
nevertheless, by an effort, the arm of a [kismt eonld reach tliruugh 
the grating and the lR*dge. 

One evening in this same month of April, Jean V'aljean had gone 
out ; Cosette, after sunset, hatl sat tlovvn t»u tliis seat. The winifwas 
freshening in tlte trees, Ct^sette was mnsing ; a vague sadness was 
coming over her little by little, that invineilile sadness which eve- 
ning gives and whicli lannes juniiai^s, who knows ? f rmn the mystery 
'i){ the tomb lialf-ojn'ned at that hour. 

Fantinc was perhaps in that shauow. 

Cosette rose, slowly made the r»nnul of tlie garden, walking in 
the gnis.s which was wet with dew, and saying'to herself through 
the kind of melancholy somnambulism in wiiicli she was eiiveloptil : 
^*One really need.s wcKKlen shoes fur tlie garden at this hour, I shali 
catch cold,'* 

She returned to the seat. 

Just as she was shling iltAvn, she noticed in the |)!ace she had 
left a stone of considerable st/e whicli evidtaitly was luii tliere the 
moment before. 

Cosette reflected upon this stone, asking herself wliat it meant. 
Suddenly, the idea that this stone did not come upon the seat of itself^ 
that sonuTody luul pul it thtw, that an arm \m\ iiassed through that 
grating, this idea came to her and marie her afraiil, it was a genuine 
fear this time; thtTe was tlie stone. No doubt was piissible, she did 
mt touch it, fled without daring to look behind her, took refuge 
in the house, and immediately shut the glass-ilwr of the stairs with 
slmtter, bar, and Imit, Site asked Trnissaint: 

**Has my father come in ?** 

&lt;*Not yet, madc‘moise!le,*’ 

(We have noticed once for a!! Toussaint^s $tamma*ing. Let us 



SAINTDENIS 783 

be permitted to indicate it no longer. We dislike the musical nota- 
tion of an infirmity.) 

Jean Valjean, a man given* to thought and a night-walker, fre- 
quently did not return till quite late. 

‘‘Toussaint/^ resumed Cosette, “you are careful in the evening 
to bar the shutters well, upon the garden at least, and to really put 
the little iron things into the little rings which fasten 

“Oh ! never fear, mademoiselle.” 

Toussaint did not fail, and Cosette well knew it, but she could 
not help adding : 

“Because it is so solitary about here !” 

“For that matter,” said Toussaint, “that is true. We would be 
assassinated before we would have time to say Boo! And then, 
monsieur doesn't sleep in the house. But don't be afraid, mademoi- 
selle, I fasten the windows like Bastilles. Lone women 1 I am sure 
it is enough to make us shudder! Just imagine it! to see men come 
into the room at night and say to you : Hush 1 and set themselves to 
cutting your throat. It isn't so much the dying, people die, that is all 
right, we know very well that we must die, but it is the horror of 
having such people touch you. And then their knives, they must cut 
badly !0 God r 

“Be still,” said Cosette. “Fasten everything well.” 

Cosette, dismayed by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, 
and perhaps also by the memory of the apparitions of the previous 
week which came back to her, did not even dare to say to her : “Go 
and look at the'Stone which somebody has laid on the seat !” for fear 
of opening the garden door again, and lest “the men” would come in. 
She had all the doors and windows carefully closed, made Toussaint 
go over the whole house from cellar to garret, shut herself up in her 
room, drew her bolts, looked under her bed, lay down, and slept 
badly. All night she saw the stone big as a mountain and full of 
caves. 

At sunrise — the peculiarity of sunrise is to make us laugh at all 
our terrors of the night, and our laugh is always proportioned to the 
fear we have had — at sunrise Cosette, on waking, looked upon her 
fright as upon a nightmare, and said to herself : “What have I been 
dreaming about ? This is like those steps which I thought I heard 
at night last week in the garden ! It is like the shadow of the stove- 
pipe I And am I going fo be a coward now !” 

The sun, which shone through the cracks of her shutters, and 
made the damask curtains purple, reassured her to such an extent 
that it all vanished from her thoughts, even the stone. 

“There was no stone on the bench, any more -than there was a 
man with a round hat in the garden ; I dreamed the stone as I did 
the rest.”

God is behind all things, but all things hide God. Things, are 
black, creatures are opaque. To love a being; is to render her trans- 
parent. 


Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, what- 
ever be the attitude of the body, the soul is on its knees. 


Separated lovers deceive absence by a thousand chimerical things 
which still have their reality. They are prevented from seeing each 
other, they cannot write to each other ; they find a multitude of 
mysterious means of correspondence. They commission the song 
of the birds, the perfume of flowers, the laughter of children, the 
light of the sun, the sighs of the wind, the beams of the stars, the 
whole creation. And why not ? All the works of God were made to 
serve love. Love is powerful enough to charge all nature with its 
messages. 

O Spring ! thou art a letter which I write to her. 


The future belongs still more to the heart than to the mind. 
To love is the only thing which can occupy and fill up eternity. The 
infinite requires the inexhaustible. 


Love partakes of the soul itself . It is of the same nature. Like it, 
it is a divine spark ; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible, imperish- 
able. It is a point of fire which is within us,, which is immortal and 
infinite, which nothing can limit and which nothing can extinguish. 
We feel it burn even in the marrow of our bones, and we see it 
radiate even to the depths of the sky. 

O love ! adorations ! light of two minds which comprehend each 
other, of two hearts which are interchanged, of two glances which 
interpenetrate ! You will come to me, will you not, happiness ? Walks 
together in the solitudes! days blessed and radiant! I have some- 
times dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves 
from the life of the angels and came here below to pass through 
the destiny of men. 


God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love one an- 
other, but to give them unending, duration. After a life of love, an 
eternity of love is an augmentation indeed; but to increase in its in- 
tensity the ineffable felicity which love gives to the soul in this 
world, is impossible, even with God. God is the plenitude of heaven j 
love is the plenitude of man. 


You look at a star from two motives, because it is luminous aiid 



786 , L E S M 1 S f: R A » L E S 

because it is itnpenetraiile. You have at jour side a softer radiance 
and a greater mystery, woman. 

We all, whoever we may be, have our resjnraljlc lieings. If they 
fail us, the air fails us, we stiiic, then we die. To die for lack of love 
is horrible. The asjihyxiri of the soul. 

W'hen love ha.s melted and mingled two l)eings into an angelic 
and sacred unity, the .secre! of life is fomifi for tliem ; they are then 
but the two terms of a single tlestiny ; they are then but the two wings 
of a single spirit. Love, s(Ktr ! 


The day that a woman who is p;issing hefitre you sheds a light 
upon you*as she goes, you tire lost, yoti love, h;ivt; then Intt one 
thing to do: to think of her .so eartiestly that she will he comi&gt;eIled 
to think of you. 


What love begins can he finished only Ity ( lod. 

True love is in despair and in raplnres iiver a ghive lost or a hand- 
kerchief fotmd, and if reipiires eternity for its devotion and its 
hopes. It is eoinposed at the same ttme of the infinitely great and the 
infinitely small. 


I f you are stone, he loadstone, if you are plant, he sensitive, if you 
are man, he love. 

Nothing suffices love. We tt.ive happiness, we wisli for |iaraciise; 
we have prmulise, wc wish for I leaven, 

■ O ye who love each other, all this is in love, lie wise enough to 
find it. I.OVC has, a.H much as Heaven, conteinjilafion, and more 
than 1 leaven, pa.ssion.nie delight. 

“J^iH's she still come In the l,Hxeiiiliunrg?'* "No, monsieur." 
"She hears mass in this church, tloes she imi ?" ‘‘.Site comes here no 
more," "IXies she still live in thiN house?" "Site lias moved awayl” 
"Whither h.is she gone to live?" "Slie did not stty!" 

What a gloomy thing, not to know the mhiress of one’s .soul? 

T,ove has its child! ikenesses, the other p.issiuiis h;ive their little- 
n«.sses. Shame tin the jiassions which rentier man little ! I lonour 
to that which makes him a chihl ! 


^ Tliere is a strange tiling, do you know it ? I am in the night. There 
js a liemg who has gone away ant! carried the heavens with her, 


Oh 1 to be laiil side by side in the same ttwnb, hand clasped in hand, 



S A I N T DE N I S 787 

and from time to time, in the darkness, to caress a finger gently, that 
would suffice for my eternity. 


You who suffer because you love, love still more. To die of love, 
is to live by it. 


Love. A sombre starry transfiguration is mingled with this 
crucifixion. There is ecstasy in the agony. 


O joy of the birds I it is because they have their nest that they 
have their song. 


Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise. 


Deep hearts, wise minds take lif e as God has made it ; it is a long 
trial, an unintelligible preparation for the unknown destiny. This 
destiny, the true one, begins for man at the first step in the interior 
of the tomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to dis- 
cern the definite. The definite, think of this word. The living see 
the infinite ; the definite reveals itself only to the dead. Meantime, 
love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas ! to him who shall 
have loved bodies, forms, appearances only. Death will take all 
from him. Try to love souls, you shall find them again. 


I met in the street a very poor young man who was in love. His 
hat was old, his coat was threadbare — there were holes at his el- 
bows ; the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his 
soul. 


What a grand thing, to be loved ? What a grander thing still, to 
love? The heait becomes heroic through passion. It is no longer 
composed of anything but what is pure ; it no longer rests upon ^ 
anything but what is elevated and great. An unworthy thought can 
no more spring up in it than a nettle upon a glacier. The soul lofty 
and serene, inaccessible to common passions and common emotions, 
rising above the clouds and the. shadows of this world, its follies, 
its falsehoods, its hates, its vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue 
of the skies, and only feels more the deep and subterranean c6m- 
motions of destiny, as the summit of the mountains feels the quaking 
of the earth. 


Were there not. someone who loved, the sun would be ex- 
tinguished. &gt;

COSETTE AFTER I’llE 1J*:TTER 

During the reading, Gisette ent(‘red gratiuully into reverie. At the 
moment she raised licr eyes from llu* last line (d the last page, the 
handsome oflicer, it was his hutn\ jKissed trininphant before the 
grating, Cosettc thought him hidecms. 

She began again to ccaiteinplate the letter. Tt was written in a 
ravishing luuu;bwriting, thought C'oselte; in the same hand, but 
with dilTcrent inks, soinetiines very hlaek, sometimes ]&gt;ale, as ink 
is put into the ink-stand, and eonsejjueiitly on differeiit &lt;lays. It was 
then a thought which liad ponreti itself tait thert‘, sigh hy sigh, ir- 
regularly, without onler, without ehttice. without aim, at liaxard. 
Cosettc had never nsid anything like it. 11us matmserit»t, in which 
she found still more clearness tlian ohscnrily, had the effect tipon 
her of a half-opened sanetiiary. Kach of these* tnystt*rious lines 
was resjilendent to her eyes, and tb&gt;odetl her luNirt With a slratige 
light. The educaticui which site had receiveti liml always spoken to

a hand which hatl opened ami thrown sndtleniy upon iuT a haiulfiil 
of sunliearns. Site felt in these few lines a passion, ate, ardtmt, gener- 
ous, honest nature, a consecrated will, an imniimse sorrow and a 
boundless hope, an oppr(*sseil liearl, a eisiasy. WTat was this

Day had revived in Iier mind : all had appearni again. She felt n

he wlio was there! he whose arm liful passed llirungh that grating! 
vMiile she was forgetting him, he had found her again ! ihn had she 
forgotten him? No, never! She wits mad It* have Ihotiehi fur a

moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire 
had been covered and had smouldered for a time, but she clearly 
saw it had only sunk in the deeper, and now it burst out anew and 
fired her whole being. This letter was like a spark dropped from that 
other soul into hers. She felt the conflagration rekindling. She was 
penetrated by every word of the manuscript : ‘'Oh, yes !” said she, 
"how I recognise all this ! This is what I had already read in his 
eyes.” 

As she finished it for the" third time. Lieutenant Theodule re- 
turned before the grating, and rattled his spurs on the pavement. 
Cosette mechanically raised her eyes. She thought him flat, stupid, 
silly, useless, conceited, odious, impertinent, and very ugly. The of- 
ficer thought it his duty to smile. She turned away insulted and in- 
dignant. She would have been glad to have thrown something at his 
head. 

She fled, went back to the house and shut herself up in her room 
to read over the manuscript again, to learn it by heart, and to muse. 
When she had read it well, she kissed it, and put it in her bosom. 

It was done. Cosette had fallen back into the profound seraphic 
love. The abyss of Eden had reopened. 

All that day Cosette was in a sort of stupefaction. She could hardly 
think, her ideas were like a tangled skein in her brain. She could 
really conjecture nothing, she hoped while yet trembling, what? 
vague things. She dared to promise 'herself nothing, and she would 
refuse herself nothing. Pallors passed over her face and chills over 
her body. It seemed to her at moments that she was entering the 
chimerical; she said to herself, "is it real?” then she felt of the be- 
loved paper under her dress, she pressed it against her heart, she 
felt its corners upon her flesh, and if Jean Valjean had seen her at 
that moment, he would have shuddered before that luminous and 
unknown joy which flashed from her eyes. "Oh, yes !” thought she, 
"it is indeed he ! this comes from him for me !” 

And she said to herself, that an intervention of angels, that a 
celestial chance had restored him to her, 

O transfigurations of love ! O dreams ! this celestial chance, this 
intervention of angels, was that bullet of bread thrown by one robber 
to another robber, from the Charlemagne court to La Fosse au3C 
Lions, over the roofs of La Force.

VI 

THE OLD ARE MADE TO GO OUT WHEN CONVENIENT 

When evening came, Jean Valjean went out ; Cosette dressed her- 
self. She arranged her hair ’’n the manner which best became her, 
and she put on a dress the neck of which, as it had received one 



790 L E S M I S K R A B T. K S 

cut of the scissors too much, and as, h}- this slope, it allowed the 
turn of the neck to be seen, was, as young girls say ‘‘a little im- 
modest/' It was not the least in the worhl iinniodest, but it was i 
prettier than otherwise. She did all this without knowing why. 

Did she intend to go out? no. 

Did she expect a visit ? no. 

At dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her 
kitchen, which looked out uprai the hack-yard. 

She began to walk under the hratudics, putting them aside with 
her hand from time to time, because there were some that were 
very low. 

She thus reached the seat. 

The stone was still there. 

She sat down, and laid her soft white hand upon that stone a.s if 
she would caress it and thank it. 

All at once, she had that indefinable impre^ssion whicl’i we feel, 
though wo see nothing, when there is someboily standing behind us! 

She turned her head and arose, 

it was he. 

lie was bareheaded. He ap|jeured pale and thin. Slie hardly dis- 
cerned his black drt’ss. The twilight diinmei! his hne fondiead, and 
covered his eyes with darkness, lie liatl, under a veil of incom- 
parable sweetness, something of death and i»f niglit. His face was 
lighted by the light of a dying day, and by the thought of a depart- 
ing .soul 

It seemed as if he was not yet a phantom, and was now no longer 
a mtin. 

His hat was lying a few .steps distant in the slirubliery. 

Cosette, ready to faint, did not utter a ery. She drew hack slowly, 
for she felt herself attracted fnrward. Me did not .stir. Ilirough the 
sad and ineiTaljIe something which enwrappi^tl hint, site felt the look 
of his eyes, which .she did not see. 

Cosette, in retreating, eneuimtered a free, and leaned against it 
But for tliis tree, she would have fallen. 

Then she heard his voice, that voiee whielt .she had never really 
heard, hardly rising above the rustling tif tin* leaves, and nmrmur- 

*M\ardc&gt;n me. I am here. My Itearr is Inirsting, I could not live as 
I was, I have come, I lave you n-ad what f placed f here, ou tins seat ? 
do you recognise me at all ? do not lie afraid of xnv, ft is a long time

be a year. For a very long tiint? now, I have not seen you at all I 
asked the chairkee^pen -she told me that she saw yint no more. You 
lived in the Rm &lt;k^ I*Oucst, on the third floor front, in a new house, 



SAINT DENIS 791 

you see that I know ! I followed you. What was I to do ? And then 
you disappeared. I thought I saw you pass once when I was reading 
the papers under the arches of the Odeon. I ran. But no. If was a 
person who had a hat like yours. At night, I come here. Do not be 
afraid, nobody sees me. I come for a near look at your windows. I 
walk very softly that you may not hear, for perhaps yoii would be 
afraid. The other evening I was behind you, you turned round, I 
fled. Once I heard you sing. I was happy. Does it disturb you that 
I should hear you sing through the shutter ? it can do you no harm. 
It cannot, can it ? See, you are my angel, let me come sometimes ; I 
believe I am going to die. If you but knew! I adore you! Pardon 
me, I am talking to you, I do not know what I am saying to you, 
perhaps I annoy you, do I annoy you ?” 

“O mother !'' said she. 

And she sank down upon herself as if she were dying. 

He caught her, she fell, he caught her in his arms, he grasped 
her tightly, unconscious of what he was doing. He supported her 
even while tottering himself. He felt as if his head were enveloped 
in smoke; flashes of light passed through his eyelids; his ideas 
vanished ; it seemed to him that he was performing a religious act, 
and that he was committing a profanation. Moreover, he did not 
feel one passionate emotion for this ravishing woman, whose form 
he felt against his heart. He was lost in love. 

She took his hand and, laid it on her heart. He felt the paper 
there, and stammered : 

*'You love me, then?*' 

She answered in a voice so low that it was no more than a breath 
which could scarcely be heard : 

'‘Hush ! you know it !"' 

And she hid her blushing head in the bosom of the proud and im 
toxicated young man. 

He fell upon the seat, she by his side. There were no more words. 
The stars were beginning to shine. How was it that their lips met: 
How is.it that the birds sing, thkt the snow melts, that the rose 
opens, that May blooms, that the dawn whitens behind the black 
trees on-'the shivering sumniit of the hills ? 

One kiss, and that was all. 

' Both trembled, and they looked at each other in the darkness with 
brilliant eyes. „ 

Thay felt neither the fresh night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp 
ground, nor the wet grass, they looked at each other, and their hearts 
were full of thought. They had clasped hands, without knowing it. 

She did not ask him, she did not even think of it, in what way 
and by what means he had succeeded in penetrating into the garden. 
It seemed so natural to her that he should be there?

BOOK SIXTH— UTTLE GAVROCHE 
I 

A MALEVOLENT TRICK OF THE WIND 

Since 1823, and while the Montfermeil chop-house was gradually 
foundering and being swallowed up, not in the abyss of a bank- 
ruptcy, but in the sink of petty debts, the Thenardier couple had had 
two more children ; both male. This made five ; two girls and three 
boys. It was a good many. 

The Thenardiess had disembarrassed herself of the two last, 
while yet at an early age and quite small, with singular good for- 
tune. 

Disembarrassed is the word. There was in this woman but a frag- 
ment of nature. A phenomenon, moreover, of which there is more 
than one example. Like Madame la Marechale de La Mothe Houd- 
ancourt, the Thenardiess was a mother only to her daughters. Her 
maternity ended there. Her hatred of the human race began with 
her boys. On the side towards her sons, her malignity was precipi- 
tous, and her heart had at that spot a fearful escarpment. As we have 
seen, she detested the eldest ; she execrated the two others. Why ? Be- 
cause. The most terrible of motives and the most unanswerable of 
responses : Because. ‘T have no use for a squalling pack of chil- 
dren,’’ said this mother. 

We must explain how the Thenardiers had succeeded in disen- 
cumbering themselves of their two youngest children, and even in 
deriving a profit from them. 

This Magnon girl, spoken of some pages back, was the same who 
had succeeded in getting her two children endowed by goodman 
Gillenoimiand. She lived on the Quai des Celestins, at the corner of 
that ancient Rue du Petit Muse which has done what it could to 
change its evil renown into good odour. Many will remember that 
great epidemic of croup which desolated, thirty-five years ago, the 
quarters bordering on the Seine at Paris, and of which- science took 
advantage to experiment on a large scale as to the efficacy of in- 
sufflations of alum, now so happily replaced by the tincture of 
iodine externally applied. In that epidemic, Magnon lost her, two 
boys, still very young, on the same day, one in the morning, the 
other at night. This was a blow. These children were precious to their 
mother ; they represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs

were paid with great; exactness, in the name nf \f, Cillenormand

care of, as everything is which is a matter of business.; not badly- 
clothed, not badly fed, treated almost like 'little gentlemen,’^ better 
with the false mother than with the true. Magnoii acted the lady 
and did not talk argot before them. 

They passed some years thus: Thenardier augured well of it. 
It occurred to him one day to say to Magnon who brought him his 
monthly ten francs, ''The father must give them an education/' 

Suddenly, these two poor children, till then well cared for, even 
by their ill fortune, were abruptly thrown out into life, and com- 
pelled to begin it. 

A numerous arrest of malefactors like that of the Jondrette 
garret, necessarily complicated with ulterior searches and seizures, 
is really a disaster for this hideous occult counter-society which 
lives beneath public society ; an event like this involves every de- 
scription of misfortune in that gloomy world. The catastrophe o£ 
the Thenardiers produced the catastrophe of Magnon. 

One day, a short time after Magnon handed Eponine the note 
relative to the Rue Plumet, there was a sudden descent of the police 
in the Rue Clocheperce. Magnon was arrested as well as Mamselle 
Miss, and the whole household, which was suspicious, was included 
in the haul. The two little boys were playing at the time in a back- 
yard, and saw nothing of the raid. When they wanted to go in, 
they found the door closed and the house empty. A cobbler, whose 
shop was opposite, called them and handed them a paper which 
"their mother" had left for them. On the paper there was an ad- 
dress : M. Barge, rent-agent, Rue du Roi de Sicile, No. 8. The man 
of the shop said to them : "You don’t live here any more. Go there 
— it is near by — the first street to the left. Ask your way with this 
paper." 

The children started, the elder leading the younger, and holding 
in his hand the paper which was to be their guide. He was cold, and 
his benumbed little fingers had but an awkward grasp, and held the 
paper loosely. As they were turning out of the Rue Clocheperce, a 
gust of wind snatched it from him, and, as night was coming on, the 
child could not find it again. 

They began to wander, as chance led them, in the streets.

crowding back the elder with his left hand and the little one with his 
knee, pushed them into the street and shut the door saying ; 

‘‘Coming and freezing people for nothing V* 

The two children went on, crying. Meanwhile a cloud had come 
up ; it began to rain. 

Little Gavroche ran after them and accosted them : 

“What is the matter with you, little brats ?” 

“We don’t know where to sleep/’ answered the elder. 

“Is that all ?” said Gavroche. “That is nothing. Does anybody cry 
for that ? Are they canaries then ?” 

And assuming, through his slightly bantering superiority, a tone 
of softened authority and gentle protection: 

‘‘Momacques, come with me.” 

“Yes, monsieur,” said the elder. 

And the two children followed him as they would have followed 
an archbishop. They had stopped crying. 

Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint Antoine in the direction of 
the Bastille. 

Gavroche, as he travelled on, cast an indignant and retrospective 
glance at the barber’s shop. 

“He has no heart, that merlan/^ he muttered. “He is an Angliche/* 

A girl, seeing them all three marching in a row, Gavroche at the 
head, broke into a loud laugh. This laugh was lacking in respect for 
the group. 

“Good day, Mamselle Omnibus,” said Gavroche to her. 

A moment afterwards, the barber recurring to him, he added: 

“I am mistaken in the animal ; he isn’t a merlan^ he is a snake. 
Wig-maker, Tam going after a locksmith, and I will have a rattle 
made for your tail.” 

This barber had made him aggressive. He apostrophised, as he 
leaped across a brook, a portress with a beard fit to meet Faust upon 
the Brocken, who had her broom in her hand. 

“Madame,” said he to her, “you have come out with your horse, 
have you ?” 

And upon this, he splashed the polished boots of a passer with’ 
mud. 

“Whelp!” cried the man, furious. 

Gavroche lifted his nose above his shawl. 

“Monsieur complains ?” 

“Of you 1” said the passer. 

“The bureau is closed,” said Gavroche. “I receive no more com- 
plaints.” 

Meanwhile, continuing up the street, he saw, quite frozen under 
a porte-cochere, a beggar giid of thirteen or fourteen, whose clothes 
were so short that her knees could be seen. The little girl was be- 



798 L Ti; i M I S E R A B L E S 

givming to be too big a girl for that. Growth plays you such tricks 
Ihe skirt becomes short at the moment that niulily becomes indecentl 

**Poor girl !” said Gavroche. **She hasn’t even any breeches. But 
here, take this/’ 

And, taking off all that good woollen which he had about his 
neck, he threw it upon the bony and purple shoulders of the beggar 
^irl, where the inufder became a shawl. 

The little girl looked at him with aii astonislied appearance, and 
received the shawl in silence. At a certain depth of distress, the poor, 
in their stupor, groan no longer over evil, and are no longer thankful 
for good. 

This done : 

''Brrr!” said Gavroclie, shivering worse than St. Martin, who, 
at least, kept half Ids cloak. 

At this l)rrr ! the storm, redoubling its fury, became violent. These 
malignant skies jninish gotHl actions. 

*‘Ah,‘” exclaimed (Javroche, “what does this mean? It rains 
again! Good God, if this continues, 1 withdraw ,my subscription.” 

And he continued Ids walk, 

“it’s all the same.” added he, casting a glance at the beggar girl 
who was cuddling herself under tlu' shawl, “there is somebody who 
has a famous peel,” 

And, looking at tlu.‘ clond, he crie&lt;i : 

“Caitglit I” 

The two children limped aknig bchiiul hint. 

As they were passing by iiiie. of iliose thick grated lattices which 
indicate altakerks shoj), for liread like gold is kept behind iron grat-' 
&amp;gs, Gavroche turned : 

“Ah, lia, nuhnes, have we dinet! ?” 

“Monsieur,” answered the (dder, “we have not eaten since early 
this morning.” 

“You are tlien witliout fatlui* tir ri^sttmed Gavroche, 

majestically. 

“Excuse us, monsieur, we have a |»apa ami mamma, but we don’t 
know where tliey art\” 

“Sometimes that’s Initer than knowing.” said Gavroche, who was 
a thinker. 

“It is two liours m&gt;w,” ctmtinued the elder, “that we have been 
walking: we liave hvvn looking for IhingH in i*very corner, but we 
call fm(l untiling.” 

“I know,” said Gavrtjriw, ”11u* dogs ear ttp everything.” 

He resumed, after a moment’s silence: 

“Ah ! we have lr»st mr authors. We kmw now what we have 
done with thetn. That won’t do, It is stupi&lt;! to get lost^Iike 

that for peonle of any age. Ah, yes, we must Iklur for all that.” 



SAINTBENIS 799 

• Still he asked them no questions. To be without a home, what 
could be more natural ? 

The elder of the two momes, almost entirely restored to the quick 
unconcern of childhood, made this exclamation : 

'Tt is Tery queer for all that. Mamma, who promised to take us 
to look for some blessed box, on Palm Sunday.’^ 

*'Neurs,^' answered Gavroche. 

‘'Mamma,'’ added the elder, “is a lady who lives with Mamselle 
Miss." 

“Tanfiute," replied Gavroche. 

Meanwhile he had stopped, and for a few minutes he had been 
groping and fumbling in all sorts of recesses which he had in his 
rags. 

Finally he raised his head with an air which was only intended for 
one of satisfaction, but which was in reality triumphant. 

“Let us compose ourselves, momignards. Here is enough for sup- 
per for three." 

And he took a sou from one of his pockets. 

Without giving the two little boys time for amazement, he pushed 
them both before him into the baker's shop, and laid his sou on the , 
counter, crying : 

“Boy ! five centimes’ worth of bread." 

The man, who was the master baker himself, took a loaf and a 
knife. 

“In three pieces, boy !" resumed Gavroche, and he added with 
dignity : 

“There are three of us." 

And seeing that the baker, after having examined the three cos- 
tumes, had taken a black loaf, he thrust his finger deep into his nose 
with a respiration as imperious as if he had had the great Frederick's 
pinch of snuff at the end of his thumb, and threw full in the baker's 
face this indignant apostrophe: 

“Whossachuav ?" 

Those of our readers who may be tempted to se^ in this summons 
of Gavroche to the baker a Russian or Polish w;ora, or one of those 
savage cries which the lowas and the Botocudos hurl at each other 
from one bank of a stream to the other, in their solitudes, are in- 
formed that it is a phrase which they use every day (they, our read-^ 
ers ) , and which takes the place of this phrase : what is that you have ? 
The baker understood perfectly well, and answered : 

“Whyl it is bread, very good bread of the second, quality." 

“You mean larton brutcd/*^ replied Gavroche, with a calm coM 
disdain. “White bread, boy! larton savonne! I am treating." 

The baker could not help smiling, and while he was cutting the 

^?||lack ■ bread. 



800 L E S M I S K K A n L E S 

white bread, he looked at them in a compassionate manner wbirt, 
offended Gavroche. 

"Come, paper cap !” said he, “what are yon fathoming us like 
that for?” 

All three placed end to end would hardly have made a fathom. 

When the bread was cut, the haken- put the sou in his drawer and 
Gavroche said to the two children ; 

“Morfilcsr 

The little hoys looked at him confounded. 

Gavroche began to laugh : 

“Ah! stop, tltat is true, they don't know yet, they arc so small.” 

And he added : 

"Eat.” 

At the .same time he handed each of them a jiitJce of bread. 

And, thinking that the elder, who aiipearcd to him more worthy 
of his conversation, descj-ved some special encouragement and oiwht 
to be relieved of all hesit.ation in regard to satisfying his appetUe, 
he added, giving him the large.st piece ; ' ’ 

"Stick that in your gun." 

Then* was one ])iece smaller than the other two: he look it for 
him.self. 

The iKior children were starving. C.avroche included. While they 
were tearing the bread with their fine teeth, they encumhered the 
shop of the haker who, now that he laid received his pay, was re- 
garding them ill-humouredly. 

“Come into the street,” .siiitl Gavroelie. 

They went on in the direction of the ll.astille. 

From time to time when they were piissisig befortt ;i liglited shop, 
the smaller one stoppetl to look at the lime liy ti leaden watch sus- 
pended fnnn his neck by .a string. 

"Here is decidedlv a real etinary,'' siiid Ci.avroehe. 

Then he thoughtfully ninltensi belweeii his teeth : 

"It’s all the .same, if 1 h;id any I wttiikt hug tliein tighte 

than this,” 

As they finished their pieces of bre.id ;md reru hed the corner of 
that gloomy Rue des Ikillets, at tlie end of wliich the low and for- 
bidding wicket of l.a Intrce is seen ; 

"fltillo, is that y&lt;iu, Gavn«‘he?‘' .said .soinebody, 

"Hullo, is that you, Motitparnassf?" .saitl Gavroche. 

A matt had just accosted the tmniit, suid this m.nn was none other 
than Monlparna,sse, di.sg«ised with lilttc eye-glasses, but recognis- 
able by G.avr*x'he. 

"Mastiff r’ ciintiniied Gavroche, "you l«ive a peel the colour of a 
flaxseed poultice and blue .s|M*«acles like a dmdor. You are in style, 
'pon the word of an old man."

^^Hush!” said Montparnasse, “not so loud/' 

And he hastily drew Gavroche out of the light of the shops. 

The two little boys followed mechanically, holding each other 
by the hand. 

When they were under the black arch of a porte-cochere, shelf 
tered from sight and from the rain : 

“Do you know where I am going ?” inquired Montparnasse. 

“To the Abbey of Monte a Regret/' ^ said Gavroche. 

“Joker !" 

And Montparnasse continued ; 

“I am going to find Babet." 

“Ah !" said Gavroche, “her name is Babet.” 

Montparnasse lowered his voice. 

“Not her, his." 

“Ah, Babet!" 

“Yes, Babet." 

“I thought he was buckled." 

“He has slipped the buckle," answered Montparnasse. 

And he rapidly related to the gamin that, on the morning of that 
very day, Babet, having been transferred to the Conciergerie, had 
escaped by turning to the left instead of turning to the right in “the 
vestibule of the Examination hall." 

Gavroche admired the skill. 

“What a dentist !" said he.- 

Montparnasse added a few particulars in regard to Babet's escape 
and finished with : 

“Oh ! that is not all." 

Gavroche, while listening, had caught hold of a cane which Mont- 
parnasse had in his hand, he had pulled mechanically on the upper 
part, and the blade of a dagger appeared. 

“Ah !" said he, pushing the dagger back hastily, “you have brought 
your gendai'me disguised as a bourgeois." 

Montparnasse gave him a wink. 

“The deuce!" resumed Gavroche, “then you are going to have 
a tussle with the cogues?” 

“We don't know," answered Montparnasse with an indifferent 
air. “It is always well to have a pin about you." 

Gavroche insisted: 

“What is it you are going to do to-night ?" 

Montparnasse took up the serious line anew and said, biting his 
syllables : . . 

“Several things." 

And abruptly changing the conversation : 


To the scaffold.

“F-xccpt the sermon/* said (lavnichc*.

Gavroche showed his two proti^ges and .said:

“Where do they sleep?” 

“/\t my Innise.” 

“Your house. Where is that ?” 

“At my hotjse/’

“Yes, I have a room.”

This is also a word in the laugitage wlikh ntjbotly write.s and 
which everybody 'uses, W’hossenialrtuliat, .signifies what is the mat-

The profottnd observation of the //i/n.'/n recalled Montjurnasse 
to calmness and to gi»ocl .sense. He a|)pear4vl to return to more re- 
Sl^ertful sentiments inr Cfavrtn‘br*s lodging. 

“Indeeti!” said he, **y&lt;vs. the elephant. Are you well off there?” 
“Very well/* said Gavroche. **'fhct‘e, really rfuvutmenf, I’hcre

“How &lt;lo you get in?” 

“I get in/'

' “And you climb up? Ves. I undersiand/*

Montparnasse began to Inugb: 

“Where tlie devil did you get these brats ?“

Gavroche simply answered : 

‘They are some momichards a wig-maker made me a present of*” 

Meanwhile Montparnasse had become thoughtful. 

“You recognised me very easily,” he murmured. 

He took from his pocket two little objects which were nothing 
but two quills wrapped in cotton and introduced one into each 
nostril. This made him a new nose. 

“That changes you,” said Gavroche, “you are not so ugly, you 
ought to keep so all the time.” 

Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a scoffer. 

“Joking aside,” asked Montparnasse, “how do you like that?” 

It was also another sound of voice. In the twinkling of an eye, 
Montparnasse had become unrecognisable. 

“Oh ! play us Punchinello !” exclaimed Gavroche. 

The two little ones, who had not been listening till now, they had 
themselves been so busy in stuffing their fingers into their noses, 
were attracted by this name and looked upon Montparnasse with 
dawning joy and admiration. 

Unfortunately Montparnasse was anxious* 

He laid his hand on Gavroche’s shoulder and said to him, dwell- 
ing upon his words : 

“Listen to a digression, boy, if I were qn the Square, with my 
dogue, my dague, and my digue, and if you were so prodigal as to 
offer me twenty great sous, I shouldn’t refuse to goupiner ^ for them, 
but we are not on Mardi Gras.” 

This grotesque phrase produced a singular effect upon the gamin. 
He turned hastily, cast his small sparkling eyes about him with 
intense attention, and perceived, within a few steps, a sergent de 
ville, whose back was turned to them. Gavroche let an “ah, yes I” 
escape him, which he suppressed upon the spot, and shaking Mont- 
parnasse’s hand : 

“Well, good night,” said he, “I am going to my elephant with 
my momes. On the supposition that you should need me some night, 
you will come and find me there* I live in the second story. There is 
no porter. You would ask for Monsieur Gavroche,” 

“All right,” said Montparnasse. 

And they separated, Montparnasse making his way towards 'the 
Greve and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little five-year-old 
drawn along by his brother, whom Gavroche was drawing along, 
turned his head back several times to see “Punchinello” going away. 

The unintelligent phrase by which Montparnasse^ had warned 
Gavroche of the presence of the sergent de ville, contained no other 
talisman than the syllable repeated five or six times under var- 
ious forms. This syllable dig, not pronounced singly, but artistkali] 

* To labour. 



804 L E S M I S li K A li I. K S 

mingled with the words (if a phrase, nieans: Take care, we cannot 
talk freely. There was I'lirlhennore in Mtnitparnasse’s phrase a 
literary Ijcauty which escaped ( layruche. that is j«y doj/ue, my dague, 
and my digue, an expression ol the arg&lt;it of the 'I'emple, which 
signifies my dog, my knife, and inyjvife, very imitii used among 
the Pitres and the Queues Iv’oiiges of the age of Louis XIV., when 
Moliere wrote and allot drew. 

Twenty t'cars ago, there was still to lie seiai in the southeast cor- 
ner of the Place de la Pastille, near the canal hasin dug in the an- 
cient ditch of the prison citadel, a grotcsijue nionunient which has 
npw faded aw.ay from the memory of P.arisians, and which is worthy 
to leave .some trace, for it was an idea of the “memher of the Insti- 
tute, General-in-t'hief of the Army of h'.gvpi." 

We say monninent, although it was only a rough model. Pmt this 
rotigh model it.self, a huge plan, a vast c.arcass of an idea of Napoleon 
which two or three successive gusts of wind hatl carried away and 
thrown each time further from ns, had hecume historical, and had 
acquired a definiteness wliich confnisteil with its provisional as- 
pect. It was an elephant, forty feet high, constructed of framework 
and masonry, hearing on its hack its tower, which resenihled a house, 
formerly [laiiited green hy some house-painter, iiow painted black 
by the sun, the rain, and tlie weather. In that optai am! deserted cor- 
ner of the Square, the broad front of the colossus, his trunk, his 
tusks, his size, his enormous rump, his four feel like columns, pro- 
duced at night, under the..starry sky, a startling and terrilile outline. 
One knew not what it meant. It was a sort of syinhol of the force of 
the people. It was gloomy, enigmatic, and immense. It was a niy,s- 
terimt.s and mighty jthantom, visibly standing by the .side of the 
itiyisible spectre of the Paslille, _ 

Few .strangers visited this eilifice, no passer-hy looketl ,nt it. It was 
falling into ruin ; every season, the mortar wliich was detached from 
its sides made hideous wounds upon it, "Tlie tediles,” as they .say in 
fashionable tiialect, had forgotten it since 1814. It was there in its 
corner, gloomy, tiiseased, cnnnhiiug, .surrounded hy ;i rotten rail- 
ing, contiimalfy Iwsmeared hy lirunketj roacimien ; tTcviees marked*

which insensilily nii.se.s the soil &lt;»f great eit ies, it was in a hollow, and 
it seemed as if the earth .sank under it. It was huge, com tanned, re- 
pulsive, and .superb; ugly to the eye of the !«iurgeois, melancholy to 
the eye of tlie thinker. It jKirtonki tt» .sotue extent, of a filth soon to 
be .swept awtty, and, to some extent, of a majesty soon to be de- 
capitated.

the old elephant became transfigured ; he assumed a tranquil and 
terrible form in the fearful serenity of the darkness. Being of the 
past, he was of the night ; and this obscurity was fitting to his great- 
ness. 

This monument, rude, squat, clumsy, harsh, severe, almost de- 
formed, but certainly majestic, and impressed with a sort of mag- 
nificent and savage seriousness, has disappeared, leaving a peace- 
able reign to the kind of gigantic stove, adorned with its stove-pipe, 
which has taken the place of the forbidding nine-towered fortress, 
almost as the bourgeoisie replaces feudality. It is very natural that 
a stpve should be the symbol of an epoch of which a tea-kettle con- 
tains the power. This period will pass away, it is already passing 
away ; we are beginning to understand that, if there may be force 
in a boiler, there can be power only in a brain ; in other words, that 
what leads and controls the world, is not locomotives, but ideas. 
Harness the locomotives to the ideas, very well ; but do not take the 
horse for the horseman. 

However, this may be, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the 
architect of the elephant had succeeded in making something grand 
with plaster ; the architect of the stove-pipe has succeeded in making 
something petty with bronze. 

This stove-pipe, which was baptised with a sonorous name, and 
called'the Columii of July, this would-be monument of an abortive 
revolution, was still, in 1832, enveloped in an immense frame-work 
covering, which we for our part still regret, and by a large board in- 
closure, which completed the isolation of the elephant. 

It was towards this corner of the square, dimly lighted by the 
reflection of a distant lamp, that the gamin directed the two 

We must be permitted to stop here long enough to declare that 
we are within the simple i-eality, and that twenty years ago the 
police tribunals would have had to condemn upon a complaint for 
vagrancy and breach of a public monument, a child who should have 
been caught sleeping in the interior even of the elephant of the 
Bastille. This fact stated, we continue. 

As they came near the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the effect 
which the infinitely great may produce upon the infinitely small, and 
said: 

*^Brats 1 don^t be frightened.” 

Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the inclosure of 
the elephant, and helped the momes to crawl through the breach. 
The two children, a little frightened, followed Gavroche without 
saying' a word, and trusted themselves to that little Providence in 
rags who had given them bread and promised them a lodging. 

Lying by the side of the fence was a ladder, which, by day, was 
used by the working-men of the neighbouring wood-yard. Gavroche

SAINT DENIS 807 

In an instant the little fellow was lifted, pushed, dragged, pulled, 
stuffed, crammed into the hole without having had time to know 
what was going on. And Gavroche, entering after him, pushing back 
the ladder with a kick so that it fell upon the grass, began to clap 
his hands, and cried : 

^‘Here we are ! Hurrah for General Lafayette 
This explosion over, he added : 

'‘Erats, you are in niy house.'* 

Gavroche was in fact at home. 

O unexpected iitiiily of the useless ! charity of great things ! good- 
ness of giants ! This monstrous monument which had contained a 
thought of the emperor, had become the box of a gamin. The mome 
had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois in 
their Sunday clothes, who passed by the elephant of the Bastille, 
frequently said, eyeing it scornfully with their goggle eyes : ^'What's 
the use of that ?" The use of it was to save from the cold, the frost, 
the hail, the rain, to protect from the wintry wind, to preserve from 
sleeping in the mud, which breeds fever, and from sleeping in the 
snow, which breeds death, a little being with no father or mother, 
with no bread, no clothing, no asylum. The use of it was to receive 
the innocent whom society repelled. The use of it was to diminish 
the public crime. It was a den open for him to whom all doors were 
closed. It seemed as if the miserable old mastodon, invaded by ver- 
min and oblivion, covered with warts, mould, and ulcers, tottering, 
wonn-eaten, abandoned, condemned, a sort of colossal beggar asking 
in vain the alms of a benevolent look in the middle of the Square, 
had taken pity itself on this other beggar, the poor pigmy who went 
with no shoes to his feet, no roof over his head, blowing his fingers, 
clothed in rags, fed upon what is thrown away. This was the use of 
the elephant of the Bastille. This idea of Napoleon, disdained by 
men, had been taken up by God. That which had been illustrious 
only, had become august The emperor must have had, to realise 
what he meditated, porphyry, brass, iron, gold, marble ; for God the 
old assemblage of boards, joists, and plaster was enough. The em- 
peror had had a dream of genius ; in this titanic elephant, armed, 
prodigious, brandishing his trunk, bearing his tower, and maldng 
the joyous and vivifyiiig waters gush out on all sides about him, he 
desired to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with 
it, he lodged a child. 

The hole by which Gavroche had entered was a break hardly 
visible from the outside, concealed as it was, and as we have said, 
under the belly of the elephant, and so narrow that hardly anything 
but cats and miomes could have passed through, 

‘'Let us begin,’* said Gavroche, "“by telling the porter that we are 
not in.” 



808 L E S M 1 S E K A It I. K S 

And plunging into the obscurity witli certainty, like one who is 
familiar with his room, he took a hoard and stoijiied the hole. 

Gavroche plunged again into th(;_ohscurity. The children heard 
the sputtering of the taper plunged into llu* idiosphoric liottle. The 
chemical taper w;is not yet in existcticc; the Fumade tinder-box 

represented progress at that period. 

A sudden light made them wink ; Gavroche had just lighted one 
of those hits of string soaked in resin which are called ccllar-rats. 
The cellar-rats, whicli made more smoke than flame, rendered the 
inside of the elephant dimly visihle. 

Gavroche’s two gue.sts looketl alMuit them, and felt something 
like what one would feel who shoidd he .shut up in the great tun of 
Hcidelherg, or heller still, what Jonah niiist h.ave felt in tlie Biblical 
helly of the whale. An entire and giganlie .skeleton appeared to them, 
and enveloped them. Above, a long dns)&lt;y beam, from w'hieh pro- 
jected at regular distanyes in.-issive eneireling timbers, represented 
the vertebral column with its rih.s, sltikaelili's of plaster luing down 
like the viscera, and from one siile to tlie other huge. .s])ider-wcbs 
made dusty di;iiihragnis._ Mere and there in the corners great black- 
ish spots were .seen, which had the a]i|iear:itice of being alive, and 
which chtmged their pl.-iees rapidly with :i wild and startled motion. 

'J'he debris fallen from the ele|&lt;hani's li.nck upon his belly had 
filled up the concavity, .so th.at they eonid wtdk upon it as upon a 
floor. 

The smalier one hugged close to his brother and said in a low 
tone : 

“Itisdark.” 

This word mtide navrocliecry iiul. 'I'he jietritled air of the two 
rntmii’s rendercfl ti shock necessttry. 

"What is th:it yon tue driving at ?" he exclaimed. “,‘\re we hum-

ries? woultl ytm he ftmls? .*say. t iiifonn you that 1 do not belong to

children came close to Gtivit tche. 

.Gavrtwhe, ptiternally stjfiened hy this eoiilidence. passed “from 
the grave to the gentle," and addressing himself to the snudler: 

“Goosjt," .saitl lie to liim, accenting tlie insult with a caressing , 
tone, "it is outside that it is dark. Outside it rains, here it doesn’t!

are heaps of folks, here there isn’t .anylHaly : untside tlrcre isn't even

The tw'o chikireii hegtin to regaril the a]&gt;artment with less fear; 
hut Gavroche did not allow them imich longer leisure for con- 
templation. 



SAINT DENIS

‘'Quick,’' said he. 

And he pushed them towards what we are very happy to be abU 
to call the bottom of the chamber. 

His bed was there. 

Gavroche's bed was complete. That is to sa^^, there was a mat- 
tress, a covering, and an alcove with curtains. 

The mattress was a straw mat, the covering a large blanket of 
coarse grey wool, very warm and almost new. The alcove was like 
this : 

Three rather long laths, sunk and firmly settled into the rubbish 
of the floor, that is to say of the belly of the elephant, two in front 
and one behind, and tied together by a string at the top, so as to form 
a pyrimidal frame. This frame supported a fine trellis of brass wire 
which was simply hung over it, but artistically applied and kept in 
place by fastenings of iron wire, in such a way that it entirely en- 
veloped the three laths. A row of large stones fixed upon the ground 
all about this trellis so as to let nothing pass. This trellis was nothing 
more nor less than a fragment of those copper nettings which are 
used to cover the bird-houses in menageries. Gavroche's bed under 
this netting was as if in a cage. Altogether it was like an Esquimaux 
tent. 

It was this netting which took the place of curtains. 

Gavroche removed the stones a little which kept down the netting 
in front, and the two folds of the trellis which lay one over the 
other opened. 

''Monies, on your hands and knees !" said Gavroche. 

He made his guests enter into the cage carefully, then he went in 
after them, creeping, pulled back the stones, and hermetically closed 
the opening. 

They were all three stretched upon the stra^w. 

Small as they were, none of them could have stood up in the al- 
cove. Gavroche still held the cellar rat in his hand. 

“Now," said he, "pionccs! I am going to suppress the cande- 
labra." 

“Monsieur," inquired the elder of the two brothers, of Gavroche, 
pointing to the netting, “what is that ?" 

“That," said Gavroche, “is for the rats, pioncecr 

However, he felt it incumbent upon him to add a few words for 
the instruction of these beings of a tender age, and he continued : 

“They are things from the Jardin des Plantes. They are used 
for ferocious animals. Tsaol (it isU whole) magazine full of them. 
Tsony (it is only) to mount over a wall, climb, by a window and 
.pass under a door. You get as much as you want." 

While he was talking, he wrapped a fold of the coverlid about the 
smaller one, who murmured : 

“Oh ! that is good ! it is warm !” 



810 LES MISER ABLES 

Gavroche looked with satisfaction npon the coverlid. 

'‘That is also from the Jardin des Plantes,” said he. 'T took that 
from the monkeys.” 

And, showing the elder the mat wpon which he was lying, a very 
thick mat and admiral)ly made, he added : 

“That was the giraffe’s.” 

After a pause, he continued: 

"'The beasts had all this. I took it from them. They didn’t care, 
I told them : It is for the elephant.” 

lie was silent again and resumed ; 

""We get over the walls and we make fun of the government 
That’s all.” 

The two children looked witli a timid and .stupefied respect upon 
this intrepid and inventive being, a vagabond like them, isolated 
like them, wretclied like them, who was sometliiiig wonderful and 
all-powerful, who secme&lt;l to them su|)t‘rnaturak and whose counte- 
nance was made up of all the grimaces of an old mountebank mingled 
with the most natural and most ])leasant smile. 

""Monsieur,” .said the elder timidly, '‘you are not afraid then of the 
sergents de ville ?” 

Gavroclie nieiady answered : 

''Maine ! wc don’t .say sergents de ville, we say cognesT 

The smaller boy had his eyes open, hut he said notliing. As he 
was on the edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche 
tucked the coverlid under him as a mother would have done, and 
raised the mat under his head witli sonu* old rags in such a way as 
to make a pillow for the mome. Then he turned towards the elder: 

‘"Eh ! we are pretty well off, here !”^ 

“Oh, yes,'* answered the ekler, looking at Gavroche with the ex- 
pression of a rescued angel 

The two poor little soaked chiklrcn were beginning to get warm. 

""Ah, now,*’ continued Gavroche, “what in the world were you 
crying for?” 

And pointing out the little &lt;&gt;ne to his 1&gt;rr»ther : 

""A youngster like that, I don’t say, hut a big boy like you, to cry 
is silly; it makes you look like a calf.” 

"‘Well,** said the chiU!, “we ha&lt;l no room, no place to go.” 

""Brat!” replied Gavroche, *‘we dtju’t sav a room, we sav a 
piolh:* \ ^ ^ 

“And then we were afriiiil to lie all alone like that in the night,” 

“We don’t .say night, we say sfirgue,'* 

“Thank you, monsieur/’ said the child. 

“Usten to me,” continued Gavroche, “you must never whine 
anymore for anything, I will take care of you. You will see what fun 
wc have. In summer we will go to the C Iluciere with Navet, a comrade 
of mine, we will go in swimming in the Basin, we will rim on the 



SAINTDENIS 811 

track before the Bridge of Austerlitz all naked, that makes the 
washerwomen mad. They scream, they scold, if you only knew how 
funny they are ! We will go to see the skeleton man. He is alive. 
At the Champs Elysees. That parishioner is as thin as anything. 
And then I will take you to the theatre. I will take you to Frederick 
Lemaitre’s. I have tickets, I know the actors, I even played once in 
a piece. We were momes so high, we ran about under a cloth, that 
made the sea. I will have you engaged at my theatre. We will go 
and see the savages. They’re not real, those savages. They have red 
tights which wrinkle, and you can see their elbows darned with 
white thread. After that, we will go to the Opera. We will go in ' 
with the claqueurs. The claque at the Opera is very select. I wouldn’t 
go with the claque on the boulevards. At the Opera, just think, 
there are some who pay twenty sous, but they are fools. They call 
them dish-clouts. And then we will go to see the guillotining. I will 
show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marias. Mon- 
sieur Sanson. There is a letter-box on his door. Oh ! we have famous 
fun !” 

At this moment, a drop of wax fell upon Gavroche’s finger, and 
recalled him to the realities of life. 

“The deuce !” said he, “there’s the match used up. Attention ! I 
can’t spend more than a sou a month for my illumination. When we 
go to bed, we must go to sleep. We haven’t time to read the romances 
of Monsieur Paul de Kock. Besides the light might show through 
the cracks of the porte-cochere, and the cognes couldn’t help see- 
ing.’’ 

“And then,’’ timidly observed the elder who alone dared to talk 
with Gavroche and reply to him, “a spark might fall into the straw, 
we must take care not to burn the house .up.” 

“We don’t say burn the house,” said Gavroche, “we say riffauder 
the bocarci.” 

The storm redoubled. They heard, in the intervals of the thunder, 
the tempe.st beating against the back of the colossus. 

“Pour away, old rain I” said Gavroche. “It does amuse me to hear 
the decanter emptying along the housels legs. Winter is a fool ; he 
throws away his goods, he loses his trouble, he can’t wet us, and it 
makes him i^umble, the old water-porter !” 

This allusion to thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche 
accepted as a philosopher of the nineteenth century, was followed 
by a very vivid flash, so blinding that something of it entered by the 
crevice into the belly of the elephant. Almost at the same instant 
the thunder burst forth very furiously. The two little boys uttered 
a cry, and rose so quickly that the trellis was almost thrown out of 
place ; but Gavroche turned his bold face towards them, and took 
advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh. 

“Be calm, children. Don’t upset the edifice. That was fine 



812 LESMISfiltABLES 

thunder ; give us some more. That wasn’t any fool of a flash. Bravo 
God ! by jinks ! that is most as good as it is at the theatre.” 

This said, he restored order in the trellis, gently pushed the two 
children to the head of the bed, pressed their knees to stretch them 
out at full length, and exclaimed : 

“As God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Children, we 
must sleep, my_ young humans. It is very liad not to sleep. It would 
make you schlingucr in your strainer, or, as the bi,g bugs say, stink 
in your jaws. Wind yourselves up well in the peel ! I’m going to ex- 
tinguish. Are you all right ?” 

“Yes,” murmured the elder, “I am right. I feel as if I had feath- 
ers under my head.” 

“We don’t say head,” cried Gavroche, ‘‘we sjiy tranche.” 

The two children hng.ged close to each olher. Gavroche finished 
arranging them upon the mat, and pulled the coverlid up to their 
ears, "then repeated for the third time the injunction in hieratic 
language : 

“Pionces!” 

And he blew out the taper. 

Hardly was the light extingijishcd when a singular tremor began 
to agitate the trellis under which the three children were lying. It 
was a multilude of dull rubbings, which gave a metallic sound, as if 
claws tind teeth were grinding the coiiper wire. This was accom- 
panied by all sorts of little sharp cries. 

The little boy of five, hearing this tumult over his head, and 
shivering with fear, pushed the_ elder brother with his elbow, but 
the elder brother had already “piont e’’ according to Gavroche’s or- 
der. Then the little boy, no lDn.ger captilile of fearing him, ventured 
to accost Gavroche, hut very low, and holding his breath: 

“Monsieur ?” 

“Hey ?” said Gavroche, who h:u! just closed his eyes. 

“What is that?” 

“It is the rats,” aiisw'ered (Ijivroche. 

And he laid his head again ttpon the mat. 

The rats, in fact, which Bwarnie&lt;l hy thousands in the carcase of 
the elephant, and wiiich were those living hlaek sfiots of which we 
have spoken, had been held in awe hy the tlaine of the candle so long 
as it burned, hut as soon as this cavern, wliieli wtts, a.s it were, their 
city, had been restored to ttight, smelling there what the good story- 
teller Perratilt ctills “some fresh meat,’* they had rusht!&lt;l in en masse 
upon Gavroche’s tent, climbed to the top, ami wt're biting its me.shes 
as if they were seeking to get through tliis new-fashioned mosquito 
bar. 

Still the little toy did not go to sleep. 

“Monitieur!” he”sai&lt;l again. 

“Hey?” said Gavroche. 



SAINT DENIS 813 

“What are the rats ?” 

“They are mice.” 

This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen some 
white mice in the course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. 
However, he raised his voice again : 

“Monsieur?” 

“Hey?” replied Gavroche. 

“Why don’t you have a cat ?” 

“I had one,” answered Gavroche, “I brought one here, but they 
ate her up for me.” 

This second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little 
fellow again began to tremble. The dialogue between him and 
Gavroche was resumed for the fourth time. 

“Monsieur !” 

“Hey?” 

“Who was it that v/as eaten up ?” 

“The cat.” 

“Who was it that ate the cat ?” 

“The rats.” 

“The mice?” 

“Yes, the rats.” 

The child, dismayed by these mice who ate cats, continued : 

“Monsieur, would those mice eat us ? 

“Golly !” said Gavroche. 

The child’s terror was complete. 'But Gavroche added 

“Don’t be afraid ! they can’t get in. And when I am here. Here, 
take hold of my hand. Be still and pionces!’ 

Gavroche at the same time took the little felldw’s liand across 
his brother. The child clasped his hand against his body, and felt 
safe. Courage and strength have such mysterious communications. 
It was once more silent about them, the sound of voices had startled 
and driven away the rats ; in a few minutes^ they might have returned 
and done their worst in vain, the three momes, plunged in slumber, 
heard nothing more. , , . 

The hours of the night passed away. Darkness covered the im- 
mense Place de la Bastille; a wintry wind, which mingled with the 
rain, blew in gusts, the patrolmen ransacked the doors, alleys, yards, 
and dark corners, and, looking for nocturnal vagabonds, passed 
silently by the elephant ; the monster, standing, motionless, with open 
eyes in the darkness, appeared to be in reverie and well satisfied 
with his good deeds, and he sheltered from the heavens and from 
men the three poor sleeping children. 

To understand what follows, we must remember that at that 
period the guard-house of the Bastille was situated at the other ex- 
tremity of the Square, and that what occurred near the 'elephant 
could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.

from the account of Montparnasse to Gavroche. Montparnasse was 
to help them from without. 

Brujon, having spent a month in a chamber of punishment, had 
had time, first, to twist a rope, secondly, to perfect a plan. Formerly 
these stern cells in which the discipline of the prison delivers thV 
condemned to himself, were composed of four stone walls, a ceih 
ing of stone, a pavement of .tiles, a camp bed, a grated air-hole, a 
double iron door, and were called dungeons; but the dungeon has 
been thought too horrible ; now it is composed of an iron door, a 
grated air-hole, a camp bed, a pavement of tiles, a ceiling of stone, 
four stone walls, and it is called chamber of punishment. There is a 
little light in them about noon. The. inconvenience of these chambers 
which, as we see, are not dungeons, is that they allow beings to re- 
flect who should be made to work. 

Brujon then had reflected, and he had gone out of the chamber 
of punishment with a rope. As he was reputed very dangerous in 
the Charlemagne Court, he was put^into the Batiment Neuf. The 
first thing which he found in the Batiment Neuf was Gueulemer, 
the second was a nail ; Gueulemer, that is to say crime, a nail, that is 
to say liberty. 

Brujon, of whom it is time to give a complete idea, was, with an 
appearance of delichte complexion and a profoundly premeditated 
languor, a polished, gallant, intelligent robber, with ah enticing look 
and an atrocious smile. His look was a result of his will, and his 
smile of his nature. His first studies in his art were directed towards 
roofs ; he had made a great improvement in the business of the lead 
strippers who despoil roofings and distrain eaves by the process 
called : the double. fat. 

What rendered the moment peculiarly favourable for an attempt 
at escape, was that some workmen were taking off and relaying, at 
that very time, a part of the slating of the prison. The Cour Saint 
Bernard was not entirely isolated from the Charlemagne Court and 
the Cour Saint Louis. There were scaffoldings and ladders up aloft; 
in other words, bridges and stairways leading towards dyiverance. 

Batiment Neuf, the most cracked and decrepit affair in the world, 
was the weak point of the prison. The walls were so much corroded 
by saltpetre that they had been obliged to put a facing of wood 
over the arches of the dormitories, because the stones detached them- 
selves and fell upon the beds of the prisoners. Notwithstanding this 
decay, the blunder was committed of shutting up in the Batiment 
Neuf the most dangerous of the accused, of putting ‘'the hard 
cases’^ in'there, as they say in prison language. ; 

The Batiment Neuf contained four dormitories one above the 
other and an attic which was called the Bel Air. A large chimney, 
probably of some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de La Force, started 
from the ground floor, passed through the four stories, cuttuig in 



816 L E S M I S E R A Jt E E S 

two all the dormitories in which it apijearcd to he a kind of flattened 
pillar, and went out throuf!:h the roof. 

Gueulemer and Brujon wert( in the same dormitory. They had 
been put into the lower story by pntcaution. It hu])pe"ncd that the 
heads of their beds rested a.s'ainst the line of the chiitiney. 

Thenardier wa.s e.'tactly above them in the attic kmnvn as the Bel 
Air. 

The passer who stops in the Rue Culture S;iinto Catherine beyond 
the barracks of the liremen, in front of the porte-cochere of the 
bath-house, secs a yard full of flowers and sliruhs in boxes, at the 
further end of which is a little wliite rotunda with two wings en- 
livened by green blinds, the hncolic dream of Je.an J.'ictiues. Not more 
than ten years ago, above this rotunda there arose a black wall 
enormous, hideous, and ban*, against which it was built. This was 
the encircling w:dl of I. a I-'orce.

garret hall, clo.sed with triple gniliiigs anti double sheet iron doors 
sluddetl with monstrous nails. Hiiteriug .at the north end, you had on 
your left the four windows, and on your right, opposite the win- 
dows, four large .stiujire c.ages. with ’sp.aees hetweeii, separated by 
narrow passages, built hre!ist-hi.gh ut iu.ast)nry with liars of iron 
to the roof, 

Thenardier liad been in .solitary in one of these c.ages .since the 
night of the 3rd of h’ehruary. Xohoily h.as ever discovered how, or 
by what corUriyauce, he h.ail succeetle,! in prt.curing ami hiding a 
bottle of that wine invented, it is s.aid, liy 1 Jesrues, with which a nar- 
tiotic is mixed, and which the hand of flie Jiutltii'tin'iirs has rendered 
eelehrated. 

There are in many firisoiis treacherous employees, half jailers 
and half thieve.s, who aiil in escapes, who .sell a f.'iilhle.ss service to 
the police, am! who make much nu ire titan tlieir salary. 

(hi this same night, then, on which little Clavroclte had picked 
up the two wandering children, Brujon and (hieulemer, knowing 
that Bahet, who Inid eseajietl that very morning, was waiting for 
them in the street as well as Montparnas.se, got up softly and began 
to pierce the flue of the chimney wliicli touched their beds, with the 
nail wliich Brujon Itad found. The fragments fell uiton Brujon’s bed, 
so that noluwly heard them. The hail storm and the thuntler shook 
the doors tHHUi their hinges, ant! made a frightful and convenient 
uproar in the iirison. Those t&gt;f the prisoners who awoke made a 



SAINT DENIS 817 

feint of going to sleep again, and let Gueulemer and Brujon alone. 
Brujon was adroit ; Gueulemer was vigorous. Before any sound had 
reached the watchman who was lying in the grated cell with a win^ 
dow opening into the sleeping room, the wall was pierced, the 
chimney scaled, the iron trellis which closed the upper orifice of the 
flue forced, ancl the two formidable bandits were upon the roof. The 
rain and the wind redoubled, the roof was slippery. 

“What a good sorgue for a crampe,” ^ said Brujon. , 

A gulf of six feet wide and eighty feet deep separated them from 
the encircling wall. At the bottom of this gulf they saw a sentinel’s 
musket gleaming in the obscurity. They fastened one end of the 
rope which Brujon had woven in his cell, to the stumps of the bars 
of the cliimney which they had just twisted off, threw the other 
end over the encircling wall, cleared the gulf at a bound, clung to the 
coping of the wall, bestrode it, let themselves glide one after the other 
down along the rope upon a little roof which adjoined the bath- 
house, pulled down their rope, leaped into the bath-house yard, 
crossed it, pushed open the porter’s slide, near which hung the cord, 
pulled the cord, opened the porte-cochere, and were in the street. _ 

It was not three-quarters of an hour since they had risen to their 
feet on their beds in the darkness, their nail in hand, their project 
in their heads. 

A few moments afterwards they had rejoined Babet and Mont- 
parnasse, who were prowling about the neighbourhood. 

In drawing down their rope, they had broken it, and there was a 
piece remaining fastened to the chimney on the roof. They had re- 
ceived no other damage than having pretty thoroughly skinned their 
hands. 

That night Thenardier had received a warning, it never could be 
ascertained in what manner, and did not go to sleep. 

About one o’clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he 
saw two shadows iiassing on the roof, in the rain and, in the raging 
wind, before the window opposite his cage. One stopped at the win- 
dow long enough for a look. It was Brujon. Thenardier recognised 
him, and under.stood. That was enough for him. Thenardier, de- 
scribed as an assassin, and detained under the charge of lying in 
wait by night with force and arms, was kept constantly in sight. A 
sentind, who was relieved every twp hours, marched with loaded 
gun before his cage. The Bel Air was lighted by a reflector. The 
prisoner had irons on his feet weighing fifty pounds. Every day, at 
four o’clock in the afternoon, a warden, escorted by two dogs — ^this 
was customary at tliat period — entered his cage, laid down near 
his bed a two pound loaf of black bread, a jug of water, and a dish 
full of very thin soup in which a feiV beans were swimming, ex- 

* WJsat a good night for an escape.

amined his irons, and slriu-k upon llu; liars. 'Phis nuin, with his do-r 
returned twice in the night. ’ 

Jhenardier had olilained pennissiun to keep a kind of an iro 
spike which he tise&lt;l to nail liis hread iiilo a crack in the wair“in - 
der,” said he, “to preserve it from the rats ," As Tiu nardie'r was con' 
stantly in siglit, they iniagined no danger from il,is sj, ike. '‘How- 
ever, it was rcmemliercd afterwards iliai :i warden liad said - “It 
'would k: belter to let him liave imtliing hut :i wooden pike.”' 

At two o’clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier 
was relieved, and his [ilaec was t;d&lt;en hy a conscript. A few mo- 
aments aflerwarrls, the man with the d igs madi- his visit, and went 
'away witlumt: noticing aiivthiiig. escept the extreme von’th and the 
“pea.sant air” of the "greenliorn.” Two hours afterw;irds, at four 
o’clock, when they came to relieve the coma-rijtt, tliey found him 
asleep, and lyiiig on the ground like a log near 'riienardier’s cat'e 
As to Tinman Her. he was not there. Ills hroken irons were on* the 
floor. There wa,s a hole in the ceiling of his rage, and ;iliove another 
hole in tiu; roof. .A hoard had hecn torn ii om his hed, and donbtle.ss 
carried away, for it was not found agMiii. There was also seized in the 
cell a half empty liotilc, containing ilu- rest of the dnie.gi-d w-ine with 
wliich the .soldier had hccit pm to sleep, 'I'lic ; oldicr’s hayunet had 
disapjic.ircd. ’ 

At the moment of this discovery, it w.as snpiioscd that Thenardier 
was (Hit ol till re;ich. 1 he reality is, that he was no longer in the 
Batiment Nenf, hut that he w;is .still in great danger. 

Thenardier on readting the roof of the IkitimeiVt N’enf, found the 
fenmant of Bntjon’s cord imiiging to the hars of the u|ipt!r trap of 
Ihechinmey, Imt this hroken eiirl hein;; nmeh loo short, he was iin- 
tihle to escape over the .sentry's path a . Hnijon and Huenlemer had 
done. 

On turning from the Rue drs Ballets into the Rue dn Roi de 
Sieile, tin the right you meet almost iiomcliatelv with a dirty recess. 
There was a house iTu-re hi the la-t eentut y, of which only the rear

SAINT DENIS 819 

Thenardier was iipcn the crest of this ruin a little after three 
o^clock in the morning. 

How had he got there? That is what nobody has ever been able 
to explain or understand. The lightning must have both confused and 
helped him. Did he use the ladders and the scaffoldings of the slaters 
to get from roof to roof, from inclosure to inclosure, from compart- 
ment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court, then 
the buildings of the Cour Saint Louis, the* encircling wall, and from 
thence to the ruin on the Rue du Roi de.Sicile? But there were gaps 
in this route which seemed to render it impossible. Did he lay down 
the plank from his bed as a bridge from the roof of the Bel Air to 
the encircling wall, and did he crawl on his belly along the coping 
of the wall, all round the prison as far as the ruin ? But the encircling 
wall of La Force followed an indented and uneven line, it rose and 
fell, it sank down to the barracks of the firemen, it rose up to the 
bathing-house, it was cut by buildings, it was'not of the same height 
on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavce, it had slopes and right 
angles everywhere ; and then the sentinels 'would have seen the dark 
outline of the fugitive ; on this supposition again, the route taken by 
Thenardier is still almost inexplicable. By either way, an impossible 
flight. Had Thenardier, illuminated by that fearful thirst for liberty 
which changes precipices into ditches, ii’on gratings into osier screens, 
a cripple into an athlete, an old gouty into a bird, stupidity into in- 
stinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence into genius, had 
Thenardier invented and extemporised a third method ? It has never 
been known. 

One cannot always comprehend the marvels of escape. The man 
who escapes, let us repeat, is inspired ; there is something of the star 
and the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight ; the effort towards 
deliverance is not less surprising than the flight towards the sub- 
lime ; and we say of an escaped robber : How did he manage to scale 
that roof ? just as it is said of Corneille : Where did he learn that he 
would die? 

However this may be, dripping with sweat, soaked through by 
the rain, his clothes in strips, his hands skinned, his elbows bleeding, 
his knees torn, Thcmardier had reached what children, in their fig- 
urative language, call the edge of the wall of the ruin, he had 
.stretched himself on it at full" length, and there his strength failed 
him, A steep escarpment, three stories high, separated him from 
the pavement of the street. 

The rope which he had was too short. 

He was, waiting there, pale, exhausted, having lost all the hope 
which he had had, still covered by night, but saying to himself that 
day was just about to dawn, dismayed at the idea of hearing in a 
few moments the neighbouring clock of Saint PauFs strike four, 
the hour when they would come to relieve the sentinel and would

4“™ SkraSl" 

The first sjaid, in a low voice, but distinctly : 



SAINT DEN I S 821 

^^Decarrons. What is it we maquillons icigo?'* ^ 

The second answered : » 

lansquine enough to put out the riffe of the rabouin. And then 
the coqueurs are going by, there is a grivier there who carries a 
gaffe, shall we let them emballer us icicaillet^ ® 

These are two words, icigo and icicaille, which both mean ia 
{here}, and which belong, the first to the argot of the Barrieres, the 
second to the argot of the Temple, were revelations to Thenardier. 
By icigo he recognised Brujon, who was a prowler of the Barrieres, 
and by icicaille Babet, who, among all his other trades, had been a 
second-hand dealer at the T emple. 

The ancient argot of the age of Louis XIV., is now spoken only 
at the Temple, and Babet was the only one who spoke it quite purely. 
Without icicaille, Thenardier would not have' recognised him, for 
he had entirely disguised his voice. 

Meanwhile the third put in a word : 

^‘Nothing is urgent yet, let us wait a little. How do we know that 
he doesn’t need our help ?” 

By this,* which was only French, Thenardier recognised Mont- 
parnasse, whose elegance consisted in understanding all argots and 
speaking none. 

As to the fourth, he was silent, but his huge shoulders betrayed 
him. Thenardier had no hesitation. It was Gueulemer. 

Biaijon replied almost impetuously, but still in a low voice : 

*What is it you bonnes us there? The tapissier couldn’t draw his 
crampe. He don’t know the trus, indeed! Bouliner his 
limace and faucher his empaffcs, maquiller a tortouse, caler boulins 
in the lourdes, braser the taffes, maquiller caroubles, faucher the 
Bards, balance his tortouse outside, panquer camoufier 

himself, one must be a mariclf The old man couldn’t do it, he don’t 
know how to ® 

Babet added, still in that prudent, classic argot which was spoken 
by Poulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, strongly- 
coloured, and hazardous argot which Brujon used, what the lan^age 
of Racine is to the language of Andre Chenier : 

'‘Your argue tapissier must have been made marron on the stairs. 
One must be arcasien. He is a galifard. He has been played the 

^Let us go, what are we doing here? »

•What is it you tell us there? The innkeeper cojildn't escape. He don’t 
know the trade, indeed! To tear up his shirt and cut up his bedclothes to 
make a rope,; to make holes in the doors, to forge false papers, to make false 
keys, to cut his irons, to hang his rope outside, to hide himself, to disguise 
himself, one must be a devil 1 The old man couldn’t do it, he don’t know how

“Friends are not left in difficulty/' nnittcred Montparnasse, 

“I bonnis you that he is maladc/' replied Bnijon. “At the hour 
which toque, the iapissicr isn’t wortli a broqitc! We can do nothing 
here. Decarrons. I expect every moment tliai a cogne will cintr^ 
me in pogncT'^ 

Montparnasse resisted now but fcelily ; the trulli is, that these four 
men, with that faithfulness which bandits e.xhibit in never abandon- 
ing each other, had been prowling all niglu: al)out La luM’ce at what- 
ever risk, in hope of seeing 'Fhenardier rise al)ove some walk But 
the night which was becoming rerdly too fine, it was storming enough 
to keep all the streets empty, llui cold whicli was growing upon them 
their soaked clotliing, their mti slioes, the alarming iiproar which 
had just broken out in the prison, tlic passing hours, the patrolmen 
they had met, hope departing, fear returning, all tliis impelled 
them to retreat. Montparnasse himself, who was, perhaps, to some 
slight extent a son-in-law of 1'henardicr, yielded. A moment more, 
they were gone. Thcnardier gasi)cd upon his wall like the ship- 
wrecked sailors of the Meduse on their raft when they saw the ship 
which had appeared, vanish in the horizon. 

He dared not call them, a cry overlteard might destroy all ; he had 
an idea, a final one, a flash of fight : he took from his pocket the end 
onh-ujoiv’s rope, which he luul detache&lt;i from the chimney of the 
Batinient Neuf, and threw it into the inck:)stire. 

This rope fell at tiieir feet. 

“A widow !" said ILihet. 

“M'y iortottscr^ said Brujon. 

“There is the innkeeper/' saitl Mont|)arnasse.

He is an apprentice. He has I&gt;een duped !&gt;y a spy, perhaps evim by a sheep,

They raised their eyes. Thenardier advanced his head a little. 

'"Quick I” said Montparnasse, '"have you the other end of the 
rope, Brujon?'’ 

"Yes.’’ 

"Tie the two ends together, we will throw him the rope, be will 
fasten it to the wall, he will have enough to get down.” 

Thenardier ventured to speak : 

"I am benumbed.” 

"We will warm you.” 

"I can’t stir.” 

"Let yourself slip down, we will catch you.” 

"My hands are stiff.” 

"Only tie the rope to the wall.” 

"I can’t.” 

"One of us must get up,” said Montparnasse. 

"Three stories!” said Brujon. 

An xAd plaster flue, which had served for a stove which had 
formerly been in use in the shanty, crept along the wall, rising al- 
most to the spot at which they saw Thenardier. This flue, then very 
much cracked and full of seams, has since fallen, but its traces can 
still be seen. It was very small. 

"We could get up by that,” said Montparnasse. 

"By that flue I” exclaimed Babet, "an orgue^ never ! it would take 
a mionJ* ^ 

"It would take a mome^^ ® added Brujon, 

"Where can we find a brat ?” said Gueulemer. 

"Wait,’' said Montparnasse, "I have the thing.” 

He opened the gate of the fence softly, made sure that nobody 
was passing in the street, went out carefully, shut the door after 
him, and started on a run in the direction of the Bastille. 

Seven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to 
Thenardier; Babet, Brujon, and Gueulemer kept their teeth 
clenched ; the door at last opened again, and Montparnasse appeared, 
out of breath, with Gavroche. The rain still kept the street entirely * 
empty. 

Little Gavroche entered the inclosure and looked upon these bandit 
forms with a quiet air. The water was dripping from his hair. 
Gueulemer addressed him : 

"Brat, are you a man?” 

Gavroche shrugged his shoulders and answered: 

"A mome like mhig is an orgue, and argues like vousailles are 
momes'* ^ 

1 A man, 

2 A child (argot of the Temple), 

* A child (argot of the Barri^res). 

^ A child like me is a man, and men like you are children.

“How the mion plays with the spitltiun !” ^ exclaimed Babet. 

“The nuhne panthwis isn't mtujiiilh} of fcrtille lansauinee"^ 
added Bmjon. ’ _ ^ ' 

“What is it you want ?” said Gavn jcue, 

Montparnasse answered : 

“To climb up liy this flue." 

“With Uiis widow,” » sai(l Babel. 

“And ligotcr the tortaiise"* continued Brujon. 

“To the woH/eof the inoitlant," ‘‘ resnined Babet. 

“To the picH of the " added Itrujuii. 

“And then?” said Guvroche. 

“That's all !” .said Gueulemer. 

The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows 
and made that inexpressiiile and dis&lt;lainful sound with the lips 
which sig'iiil’K's ; 

“What *.s that?" 

“There is a man up th&lt;’re whom you will .save,” replied Mont- 
parnasse. 

“Will you?” added Brujon. 

, “Goiisy !" answered the ehilil, as if the (piestinn appeared to him 
absurd ; and he took off his shoes. 

GueuIemiT caught up Gavroclie with one hand, imt him on the 
roof of the sluuity, tlie worm-e;iten boards of wliieh bent beneath 
the child’s weight' ami haniled him the rope which llrnjon had tied 
together during the_ absence of Montparnasse. The gamin went 
towards the flue, which it was easy to enter, thanks to a large hole 
at the roof. Just as lie was about to start, Thenardier, wlio saw 
safety and life apiiroaching, lient over the edge &lt;tf the wall ; the first 
gleam 'of day lighted tiji his foreheatl reeking with swetit, his livid 
cheeks, his thin .'tnd sav.age nn.se, hi.'i grey hristly beard, and Ga- 
vroche recognised itim ; 

“Hold on!” said he, “it is my father! — Well, that don’t hinder 1” 

And takitig the rope in his teelh, he resolutely ctimmenccd the 
ascent. 

He reached the top of the ruin, bestrode the ohl wall like a horse, 
and tied the rope firmly to the tippiT cross-I»ar of the window. 

A moment afterwards Tiu'iianlicf was in tlu* street. 

As .stum as he h.ad tnuched the pavement, as soon as he felt him-

like a whiff of smoke, all that strange and ferocious intellect awroke, 
and found itself erect and free, ready to march forward. The man’s 
first words were these : 

'^Now, who are we going to eat ?” 

It is needless to explain the, meaning of this frightfully trans- 
parent word, which signifies all at once to kill, to assassinate, and to 
plunder. Eat, real meaning ; devour. 

^‘Let us hide first,” said Brujon, ‘‘finish in three words and we will 
separate immediately. There was an affair which had a;good look 
in the Rue Pluniet, a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rusty 
grating upon a garden, some lone women.” 

“Well, why not?’^ inquired Thenardier. 

“Your fee ^ Eponine, has been to see the thing,” answered Babet, 

“And she brought a biscuit to Magnon,” added Gueulemer, 
“nothing to maquiller there.” “ „ 

“The fee isn’t loffe/^ ^ said Thenardier. “Still we must see.” 

“Yes, yes,” said Brujon, “we must see.” 

Meantime none of these men appeared longer to see Gavroche 
who, during this colloquy, had seated himself upon one of the stone 
supports of the fence ; he waited a few minutes, perhaps for his 
father to turn towards him, then he put on his shoes, and said : 

“It is over ? you have no more use for me ? men ! you are out of 
your trouble. I am going. I must go and get my momes up.” 

And he went away. 

The five men went out of the inclosure one after another. 

When Gavroche had disappeared at the turn of the Rue des Bal- 
lets, Babet took Thenardier aside. 

“Did you notice that mionf” he asked him. 

’“What mion.^^^ 

“The mion who climbed up the wall and brought you the rope/* 

“Not much.” 

“Well, I don’t know, but it seems to me thzt it is your son.”

story introduced into a work written with the same aim as the 
present,’ a robber talking argot, tiiere was amazement and clamour. 
'‘What ! hc5w ! argot ! Hut argot is hideous ! why, it is the language 
of convicts, of the galleys, of the prisons, of all that is most abom- 
inable In society 1" etc., etc., etc. 

We have never comprehended this sort of objection. 

Since then two powerful Tomancers, one of whom i.s a profound 
observer of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the 
people, Balzac and Eugene Stic, having made bandits ta’k in their 
natural tongue as the author of Le Dernier Jour d'm Condamni had 
done in 1828 , the satne outcry was ma&lt;ie. It was rejieatetl : “What do 
these writers mean by this revolting patois? Argot is horrid! argot 
makes us .shudder !” 

Who denies it? Undoubtedly. 

^ Where the puriwse is to probe a wound, an abyss, or a society, 
since when has it been a crime to de.scend too far, tn go to the bottom ? 
We had always thought that it was sometimes an act of courage, 
and at the very least a simple and useful act, worthy of the sympa- 
thetic attention which is merited by a duty accomplished and ac- 
cepted. Not explore the whole, not .study the whole, stop by the way, 
why ? To stop is the part of the lead and not of the leadsman. 

Certainly, to go into the lowest depths of the social order, where 
the earth ends and the mire begins, to search in those thick waters, 
to pursue, to^ seize and to throw out still throbbing upon the pave- 
ment this abject idiom which streams with fildi as it Is thus drawn

to the light, this pustulous vocabulary in which each word seems a 
huge ring from some monster of the slime and the darkness, is 
neither an attractive task nor an easy task. Nothing is more mourn- 
ful than to contemplate thus bare, by the light of thought, the fear- 
ful crawl of argot. It seems indeed as if it were a species of horrible 
beast made for the night, which has just been dragged from its cess- 
pool. We seem to see a frightful living and bristling bush which 
trembles, moves, quivers, demands its darkness again, menaces, 
and stares. This word resembles a fang, that a quenched and bleed- 
ing eye ; this phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab. All this 
is alive with the hideous vitality of things which are organised in 
disorganisation. 

Now, since when has horror excluded study ? Since when has the 
sickness driven away the physician ? Imagine a naturalist who should 
refuse to study the viper, the bat, the scorpion, the scolopendra, 
the tarantula, and who should cast them back into their darkness, 
saying : Oh ! how ugly they are ! The thinker who should turn away 
from argot would be like a surgeon who should turn away from an 
ulcer or a wart. He would be a philologist hesitating to examine a 
fact of language, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinise a fact of 
humanity. For, it must indeed be said to those who know it not, 
argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result. What is 
argot; properly speaking ? Argot is the language of misery. 

Here we may be stopped ; facts may be generalised, which is 
sometimes a method of extenuating them ; it may be said that all 
trades, all professions, one might almost add all the accidents of 
the social hierarchy and all the forms of the intellect, have their 
argot. The merchant who says: merchantable London stout, ^ fine 
quality Marseilles, the stockbroker who says : seller sixty, dividend 
off, the gambler who says : Til see you ten better, will you fight the 
tiger? the huissier of the Norman Isles who says : the enfeoff or re- 
stricted to his lands cannot claim the fruits of these grounds during 
the heritable seisin of the renouncer^s fixtures, the philosopher who 
says^: phenomenal triplicity, the whale hunter who says: there she 
blows, there she breaches, the phrenologist who says : amativeness, 
combativeness, secretiveness, the fencing master who says : tierce, 
quarto, retreat, the compositor who says: a piece of pie, ell, com- 
positor, fencing-master, phrenologist, whale-hunter, philosopher, 
huissier, gambler, stockbroker, merchant, speak argot. The cobbler 
who says : my kid, the shop-keeper who says : my counter-jumper, 
the barber who says : my clerk, the printer who says : my devil, speak 
argot. In strictness, and if we will be absolute, all the .various 
methods of saying right and left, the sailor’s larboard and star- 
board, the machinist’s court and garden side, the beadle’s 

side exid Gospel side, are argot. There is an argot of the affected as 
■^be^re was the argot of the Pricieuses. Tlht Hotel de Rambouillet

bordered to some extent upon the Cour des Miracles. There is an 
argot of duchesses, witness this phrase written in a love-letter by a 
very great lady and a very pretty woman of the Restoration : “You 
will find in these postings a multitude of reasons why I should liber- 
tise.” ^ Diplomatic ciphers are argot ; the Pontifical Chancellory, in 
saying 26 for Rome, grkstntgsyal for packet, and ahfxiistgrno- 
grksu tu xi for Duke of Modena, speaks argot. The physicians of 
the Middle Ages who, to say carrot, radish, and turnip, said: ofo- 
ponach, pcrfroschiniim, rcptitalmus, dracaiholicmn angelonm 
postmegomm, spoke argot. The sugar manufacturer who says: 
“Rectified, loaf, clarified, crushed, lump, molasses, mixed common 
burned, caked,” this honest manufacturer talks argot. A certain 
critical school of twenty years ago which said : “The half of Shake- 
speare is plays upon words and puns” — spoke argot. I'he poet and 
the artist wlio, with deef) signilicance, will &lt;iescrihe M. de Mont- 
morency as “bourgeois,” if he is not familiar with poetry and 
statues, speak argot. 'I'he classic Aca&lt;lcmician who calls flowers 
fruits Pomona, \ha sea Neptune, hive the fires, beauty the 
attractions, a horse a courser, the white or the tricoloured cockade 
the rose of Bellona, tlu* thrw-cornered hat the triangle of Mars, the 
classic Acadeniician speaks argot. .Mgcbra. medicine, botany, have 
their argi:&gt;t. The languiige which is employed allo.at, that wonderful 
language of the se;i, so complete ami si&gt; picturescpie, which was 
spoken by Jean Hart, Dmiuesne, SuCfren, anti Duperre, which 
mingles with the whistling of the rigging, with the .sound of the 
speaking trumpet, with the clash of the boanling-.n.xe, with the roll- 
ing, with the wind, with the .stiuall, with the ctinnon, is all a heroic 
and splendid argot which is to the savage argot of crime what the 
lion is to the jackal. 

Undoubtedly. Hut, whateviT ('au be said aliotit it, this method of 
underst.'iuding the word ;trgt&gt;i is an e.'ttension, which even people 
in general will not tidmit. As for tts, we continue to this word its 
old acceptatitm, precise, circumscribed, and definite, and we limit 
argot to argoh Tine real jirgot, the argot par (wccllcHce, if tfiese 
words can be joined, the immemorial argot which WiUs a realm, is 
nothing more nor less, we reiJcut, than the ugly, restless, sly, treach- 
erous, venomtnis, cruel, crooked, vile, &lt;leej), deadly language of 
misery. There is, at the extremity of all tleba.semenls and all misfor- 
tunes, a l;ist wretchedness which revolts juul determines to enter into 
a struggle against the whole mass of forttmate things and reigning 
rights ; a hideou.s struggle in which, sometimes by fraud, sometimes 
b/ force, at the same time .sickly and fierce, it attacks social order

with pin-thrusts through vice and with club strokes through crime. 
For the necessities of this struggle, misery has invented a language 
of battle which is argot. 

To buoy up and to sustain above oblivion, above the abyss, were it 
only a fragment of any language whatever which man has spoken 
and which would otherwise be lost, that is to say one of the elements, 
good or evil, of which civilisation is composed or with which it is 
complicated, is to extend the data of social observation; it is to 
serve civilisation itself. This service, Plautus rendered, intentionally 
or unintentionally, by making two Carthaginian soldiers speak 
Phoenician ; this service Moliere rendered, by making so many of his 
personages speak Levantine and all manner of patois. Here objec- 
tions are revived; the Phoenician, perfectly right! the Levantine, 
well and good ! even patois, so be it ! these are languages which have 
belonged to nations or provinces; but argot? what is the use of 
preserving argot? what is the use of ‘"buoying up’' argot? 

To this we shall answer but a word. Certainly, if the language 
which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, there 
is something still more worthy of attention and study in the lan- 
guage which a misery has spoken. 

It is the language 'which has been spoken in France, for example, 
for more than four centuries, not merely by a particular form of 
misery, but by misery, every possible human misery. 

And then, we insist, the study of social deformities and infirmi- 
ties and their indication in order to cure them, is not a work in which 
choice is permissible. The historian of morals and ideas has a mis- 
sion no less austere than that of the historian of events. The latter 
has the surface of civilisation, the struggles of the crowns, the births 
of princes, the marriages of kings, the battles, the assemblies, the 
great public men, the revolutions in the sunlight, all the exterior ; 
the other historian has the interior, the foundation, the people who 
work, who suffer, and who wait, overburdened woman, agonising 
childhood, the dumb wars of man with man, the obscure ferocities, 
the prejudices, the established iniquities, the subterranean reactions 
of the law, the secret evolutions of souls, the vague shudderings of 
the multitudes, the starving, the barefooted, the bare-armed, the 
disinherited, the orphans, the unfortunate and the infamous, all the 
goblins that wander in darkness. He must descend with a heart at 
the same time full of charity and of severity, as a brother and as a 
judge, to those impenetrable casemates where crawl in confusion 
those who bleed and those who strike, those who weep and those 
who curse, those who fast and those who devour, those who suffer 
wrong, and those who commit it. Have these historians, of hearts 
and souls lesser duties than the historians of exterior facts? Do you 
think that Dante has fewer things to say than Machiavelli? Is the 
under- world of civilisation, because it is deeper and more gloomy. 



830 LES MISERABLES 

less important than the upper ? Do we really know the mountain 
when we do not know the cavern ? 

We must say, however, by the way, from some words of what 
precedes, a decided separation between the two classes of historians 
might be inferred, which does not exist in our mind. No man is a 
good historian of the open, visible, signal, and public life of the na- 
tions, if he is not, at the same time, to a certain extent, the historian 
of their deeper and hidden life ; and no man is a good historian of 
the interior if he know not to he, whenever there is need, the his- 
torian of the exterior. The history of morals and ideas interpenetrate 
the history of events, and vice ver.sa. They are two orders of dif- 
ferent facts which answer to each other, which are always linked 
with and often produce each other. All tlie lineaments which Provi- 
dence traces upon the surface of a nation have their dark but dis- 
tinct parallels, in the bottom, and all the convulsions of the bottom 
produce upheavals at the surface. True history dealing with all 
the true historian deals wdth all. 

Man is not a circle with a single centre ; he is an ellipse with two 
foci. Facts are one, ideas are the other. 

Argot is nothing more nor less than a wardrobe in which lan- 
guage, having some bad deed to do, disguises itself. It puts on word- 
masks ami metaphoric rags. 

In which way it becomes horrible. 

We can hardly recognise it. hs it really the French tongue, the 
great human tongue ? I'here it is ready Icj enter uiion the scene and 
give the cue to crime, and fitted for all the emijloyments of the 
repertory of evil. It walks no more, it hobbles ; it limps upon the 
crutch of the Cour dcs Miracles, a crutch which can be metamor- 
phosed into a club; it gives itself the name of vagrancy; all the 
spectres, its dressing-maids, have hegrinied it ; it drags itself along 
and rears its head, the two characteristics of the reptile. It is apt for 
all parts henceforth, made squint-eyed by the forger, verdigrised 
by the poisoner, charcoaled by the iiicendlary’.s soot ; and tire mur- 
derer puts on his red. 

_ When we li.slen, on the side of honest: iieople, at the door of so- 
ciety, we overhear the dialogue of tho.se who are without. We dis- 
tinguish tpiestions and answers. We jierceive, without understand- 
ing, a hideous murmur, .sfiutuling almost like iniman tones, but 
nearer a howling than speech. This is argot. 'Hie words are un- 
couth, and marked by an indesicribably fatnastic beastliness. We 
link we hear hydras talking. 

It is the unintelligihle in tlie dark. It gnashes and it whispers, 
ampleting twilight by enigma. It grows black in misfortune, it 
grows blacker still in crime; these tw&lt;i blacknesses amalgamated 
make'Ar^ot. Darkne.ss in the atmosphere, darkness in the deeds, 
darkness in the voices. Apjialling toad language, which comes and 



SAINTDENIS 831 

goes, hops, crawls, drivels, and moves monstrously in that bound' 
less grey mist made up of rain, night, hunger, vice, lying, injustice, 
nakedness, asphyxia, and winter, the broad noonday of the miser- 
able. 

Let us have compassion on the chastened. Who, alas ! are we our- 
selves ? who am I who speak to you ? who are you who listen to me ? 
whence do we come ? and is it quite certain that we did nothing 
before we were born ? The earth is not without resemblance to a jail ? 
Who knows that man is not a prisoner of Divine Justice. 

Look closely into life. It is so constituted that we feel punishment 
everywhere. 

Are you what is called a fortunate man? Well, you are sad every* 
day. Each day has its great grief or its little care. Yesterday you 
were trembling for the health of one who is dear to you, to-day 
you fear for your own ; to-morrow it will be an anxiety about money, 
the next day the slanders of a calumniator, the day after the mis- 
fortune of a friend ; then the weather, then something broken or 
lost, then a pleasure for which you are reproached by your con- 
science or your vertebral column reproaches you; another time, 
the course of public affairs. Without counting heart troubles. And 
so on. One cloud is dissipated, another gathers. Hardly one day in 
a hundred of unbroken joy and of unbroken sunshine. And you 
are of that small number who are fortunate ! As to other men, stag- 
nant night is upon them. 

Reflecting minds make little use of this expression : the happy 
and the unhappy. In this world, the vestibule of another evidently, 
there is none happy. 

The true division of humanity is this : the luminous and the dark. 

To diminish .the number of the dark, to increase the number of 
the luminous, behold the aim. This is why we cry : education, knowl- 
edge! to learn to read is to kindle a fire; every syllable spelled 
sparkles. 

But he who says light does not necessarily say joy. There is suf- 
fering in the light ; in excess it burns. Flame is hostile to the wing. 
To burn and yet to ily, this is the miracle of genius. 

When you know and when you love you shall suffer still. The day 
dawns in tears. The luminous weep, were it only over the dark.

Argot is the language of the dark. 

Thought 'is aroused in its gloomiest depths, social philosophy is 
excited to its most poignant meditations, before this enigmatic dia- 
lect which is at once withered and rebellious. Here is chastisement

visible. Each syllable has a branded look. The words of the common 
language here appear as if wrinkled and shrivelled under the red- 
hot ii*on of the executioner. Some seem still smoking. A phrase 
affects you like the branded shoulder of a robber suddenly laid 
bare. Ideas almost refuse to be expressed by these substantives con- 
demned of justice. Its metaphor is sometimes so shameless that we 
feel it has worn the iron collar. 

Still, in spite of all that and because of all that, this strange dia- 
lect has of right its compartment in that great impartial collection 
in which there is place for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold 
medal, and which is called literature. Argot, whether we consent 
to it or not, has its syntax and its poesy. It is a language. If, by the 
deformity of certain terms, we recognise that it was 'mumbled by 
Mandrin, by the splendour of certain metonomies, we feel that it 
was spoken by Villon. 

This verse so exquisite, and so famous : 

Mais ou sout les nciRcs d’antan ? ’ 

is a verse of argot. Jnlan — aiiic annum — is a word of the argot of 
Thunes which signifies the past year, and by extension formerly. 
There might still be read thirty-five years ago, at the time of the 
departure of the great chain ill 1827, in one of the dungeons of 
Bicetre, this maxim engraved on the w'lill with a nail by a king of 
Thunes c®ndemned to the galleys : Les dabs d'antan trlmaient siern- 
pre pour la pierre du Cdcs7r. Which means ; the kmgs of old time 
akvays went to be consecrated. In the mind of that king, consecration 
was the galleys. 

The word dccaradc, which expres.sos the departure of a heavy, 
waggon at a gallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is 'worthy of him. 
This word, which strikes fire with four feet, resumes in a masterly 
onomatopceia the whole of La Fontaine’s admirable verse : 

Six fort.s chevaux tiraient un coche.* 

In a purely literary |)oint of view, few studies would be more 
curious and more prolific than that of argot. It is a complete lan- 
guage within a language, a sort of disea.se&lt;l e.xcrescence, a sickly graft 
which has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in 
the old Gallic trunk, the sinister foliage of which creeps over an 
entire side of the language. This is what may be called the primary 
aspect, the general aspect of argot. But to those who study language 
as it should be .studied, that is to .sa 3 j as geologists .study the earth, 
argot appears, as it were, a true alluvium. According as we dig more 

_ am wtien are me snows oi mironi 
Six sturdy horses drew a coach.

or less deep, we find in argot, beneath the old popular French, Pro- 
vencal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, this language of the Mediter- 
ranean ports, English and German, Romance in its three varieties, 
French Romance, Italian Romance, Romance Romance, Latin, and 
finally Basque and Celtic. A deep and grotesque formation. A sub- 
terranean edifice built in common by all thb miserable. Each ac- 
cursed race has deposited its stratum, each suffering has dropped 
its stone, each heart has given its pebble. A multitude of evil, low, or 
embittered souls, who have passed through life and vanished in 
eternity, are preserved here almost entire and in some sort still 
visible under the form of a monstrous word. 

Will you have Spanish ? the old Gothic argot swarms with it. Here 
is hoffette, blow, which comes from bofeton; vantane, window 
(afterwards vanterne), which comes from vantana; gat, cat, which 
comes from gato; acite, oil, which comes from aceyte. Will you 
have Italian ? Here is spade, sword, which comes from spada; car- 
vel, boat, which comes from caravella. Will you have English? 
Here. is bichot, bishop; raille, spy, which comes from rascal, rascal* 
lion; pilche, box, which comes from pitcher . Will you have Ger- 
man? Here is caleur, waiter, kellner; hers, master, herzog (duke). 
Will you have Latin? Here is frangir, to break, frangere; affurer, 
to rob, fur; cadene, chain, catena; there is a word which appears in 
all the languages of the continent with a sort of mysterious power 
and authority, the word magmis; the Scotchman makes of it his 
mac, which designates’ the chief of the clan, Mac Farlane, Mac 
Callummore, the great Farlane, the great Callummore;^ argot 
makes of it the meek, and afterwards, the meg, that is to say Grod. 
Will you have Basque? Here is gahisto, the devil, which comes 
from gdiztoa, evil ; sorgabon, a good night, which comes from go* 
bon, good evening. Will you have Celtic? Here is blavin, handker- 
chief, which comes from gashmg menesse, w;oman 

(in a bad sense), which comes from meinec, full of stones ; barant, 
brook, from baranton, fountain; goffeur, locksmith, from goff, 
blacksmith ; death, which comes ixom guenn-du, 

blackJ Finally, will you have histopr? argot calls crowns medteses, 
a reminiscence of the coins which circulated on the galleys of Maltaw 

Besides the philological origins which we have just pointed out) 
argot has other still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, 
from the mind of man itself ^ 

First, the direct creation of words. In this is the mystery of 
languages. To paint by words which have forms, we know not how 
nor why. This is the primitive foundation of all human, language-^ 
what might be called the granite. Argot swarms with words of this 
kind, root-words, made out of wiiole cloth, we know not where nor 

‘ It should, however, be observed that mac in Celtic mefans son.

Secondly, metaphor. It is the ]»eenliarify of a language, the object 
of which is to tell everything and conceal everything, to abound in 
figures. Metaphor i.s an eiiigni.a which ohers itself as a refuge to the 
robber wdio plots a idow, to tlte prisoner whtt plans aii esrax;. No

orgue, in iergue, or in uche. Thus: Voiizierque trouvaille honor gue 
ce gigotmuchef^ Do you like this leg of mutton? A phrase ad- 
dressed by Cartouche to a turnkey, to know whether the amount 
offered for an escape satisfied him. The termination in mar is of 
modern date. 

Argot, ^ being the idiom- of corruption, is easily corrupted. More- 
overi as it always seeks disguise so soon as it perceives it is under-- 
stood, it transforms itself. Unlike all other vegetation, every ray 
of light upon it kills what it touches. Thus argot goes on decomposeci 
and recomposed incessantly; an obscure and rapid process which 
never ceases. It changes more in ten years than the language in ten 
centuries. Thus the larton^ becomes the lartif; the gail * becomes 
the gaye; the fertauche/‘ the fertille; the momignard, the momac^^ 
que; the fiques,^ the frusques; the chique,^ the egrugeoir; the co^ 
lahre^ the colas. The devil is first gahisto, then the rabouin, then the 
baker ; the priest is the ratichon, then the boar ; the dagger is the 
twenty-two, then the surin, then the lingre; police officers are railles^ 
then roussins, then rousses^ then lacing merchants, then couqu-^ 
eurs, then cognes; the executioner i$ the Taule, then Chariot, then 
the atigeur, then the becquilard. In the seventeenth century, to fight - 
was to take some tobacco;^ in the nineteenth it is to chew the jaws. 
Twenty different expressions have passed between these two ex- 
tremes. Cartouche would speak Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words 
of this language are perpetually in flight like the men who use them, 
Froni time to time, however, and because of this very change, 
the ancient argot reappears and again becomes new. It has its cen- 
tres in which it is continuous. The temple preserves the argot of 
the seventeenth century ; Bicetre, when it was a prison, preserved the 
argot of Thunes. There was heard the termination in anche of the 
old Thuners. Boyanches tuf ® (do you drink ?) il croy anche ® (he 
believes). But perpetual movement, nevertheless, is the law. 

If the philosopher succeeds in fixing for a moment for the ob- 
server this language, which is incessantly evaporating, he falls into 
painful yet useful meditations. No study is more efficacious and more 
prolific in instruction. Not a metaphor, not an etymology of argot 
which does not contain its lesson. Among these men, to beat means 
to feign; they beat a sickness ; craft is their strength. 

To them the idea of man is inseparable from the idea of shade® 
The night is called sorgue; man, orgue, Man is a derivative of night, 
They have acquired, the habit of considering society as an atmos^ 
phere which kills them, as a fatal force, and they speak of their 
liberty as one would of his health. A man arrested is sick; a man 
condemned is dead.

What is most terrible lo tlic prisoner in the four stone walls 
which enshroud him is a sort of iev cliastity : he calls the dungeon 
the castiis. In this funereal place, life will unit is always under its

self a /(///o/. iM'nally. whui name dt* the malefactors give to the 
prison? the eollejie. A whole penitentiary system might spring from 
this word. 

Would you kiunv where mi^st of the s&lt;tn.s‘;s of the galleys have 
originated, those refrains called in sjtecial plirase the lirlonfa? 
Listen to this. 

There was at the Chatelei iie Laris a Iimad long cellar. This cel- 
lar was eight feet deep below tin* level yd” the Seine, it had neither 
witulows nor ventilators, the only opening was tlu* door ;anen could 
enter, hut not air. I'lu* cellar hat! fin* a ceiling a sltuie arch, and for 
a floor, ten inches of mud. It had l*een [sivetl with tiles, hut, under 
the ot tiding of the waters, the pavement had rotted and broken up. 
Eight fei*t above the a k*ng massive hvnm crossed this vault 
from side ti&gt; side; ftami this beam there hung, at intervals, chains 
tliree feet in length, and at the end of these chains there were iron 
collars. Mm eomieiniied lo the galleys wa»re pul into tliis cellar until 
the day oi their departure for I’ouhm. Tht-y were pushed under this 
timlier, where each bat! bis iroti swinging in tlie darkness, waiting 
for iiim, Hu* chains, tlu»se fumdent arms, and the ctdlars, tho.se open 
hands, seized these wreUdu*s by the neck. They were riveted, and 
they were left tliere. The chain beitig too short, they mild not lie 
down, Hiey remaitiefl motionless in this cave, in this lifackness, under 
this liinlnT, almost htnig, forced to monstrous exertions to reach 
their bread or their {nidier, the arch above their heads, the mud up 
to their knees, their ordure running down tfieir legs, collapsing with 
fatigue, their liips and knees giving way, hanging !)y their hands 
to the chain in rest themselves, iinalile to sleep except standing, and

awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar : some did not 
awake. In order to eat, they had to draw their bread, which was 
thrown into the mire. Up the leg with the heel, within reach of the 
hand. How long did they continue thus ? A month, two months, six 
months sometimes ; one remained a year. It was the antechamber 
of the galleys. Men were put there for stealing a hare from the 
king. In this hell-sepulchre what did they do ? What can be done in 
a sepulchre, they agonised, and what can be done in a hell, they 
sang. For where there is no more hope, song remains. In the waters 
of Malta, when a galley was approaching, they heard the song 
before they heard the oars. The poor poacher, Survincent, who had 
passed through the cellar-prison of the Chatelet said : it was the 
rhymes which sustained me. Uselessness of poetry. Of what 
use is rhyme ? In this cellar almost all the argot songs took birth.. 
It is from the dungeon of the Grand Chatelet de Paris that the mel- 
ancholy galley refrain of Montgomery comes: Timaloumisaine, 
timoulamaison. Most of these songs are dreary ; some are cheerful ; 
one is tender ; 


Icicaille est le theatre 
Du petit dardant’' 

The endeavour is vain, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic of 
the human heart, love. 

In this world of dark deeds secresy is preserved. Secresy is the 
interest of all. Secresy to these wretches is the unity which serves 
as a basis of union. To violate secresy is to tear from each member 
of this .savage community something of himself. To inform against, 
in the energetic language of argot, is called : Manger le morceau? 
As if the informer seized a bit of the substance of all, and fed upon 
a morsel of the flesh of each. 

Wliat is to receive a blow? The hackneyed metaphor responds; 
Cest voir trente-six chandelles.^ Here argot intervenes and says : 
chandclle, camoufle. Upon this, the common language gives as a 
synonym for blow, camouflet. Thus, by a sort of upward penetra- 
tion, through the aid of a metaphor, that incalculable trajectory, ar- 
got rises from the cavern to the Academy; and Poulailler saying: 
“I light my camoufle," makes Voltaire write : "Langleviel La Beau- 

melle de.serves a hundred 

A search into’ argot is a discovery at every step. Study and re- 
search into this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of inter- 
section between popular society and outcast society.

As we see, all argot, the argot of fmjr luiinlrcd years ago as well as 
the argot of the present, i.s pervatiei! with thiit somhre spirit of 
symbolism which gives l(t its every wni-fi, sometimes an appearance 
of grief, sometimes an air oi ineil;ice. We fwl in it tin: old, savage 
gloom of those vagtilKuids of the (‘{nir des Miracles who played 
cards with j5ack.s pectilutr to tlB'itisclves, .some of which have 1&gt;een 
preserved. The eight t»f clubs, for instance, represented a large 
tree bearing eight enormou.s clover leafs, a sort of fantastic ixtr- 
sonification of the forest. At the fiwt of this tree a fire wai seen at 
which three hares wen: roa.sting a Inuitcr on spit, and in the back- 
gromid, over another fire, w.t.s a smoking jait frtun which the head 
of a dog projected. Nothing can be iimre niouriifiil than these 
pictured reprisals, upon a pack of c:»rds, in the day.s of the stake 
for rotisting contrabandists, ttnd the ranklron for Ijoiliiig coimter- 
feiters. 'Ilie various forms whiclj tliuiiglit asstinied in the realm of 
argot, even .song, even raillery, even menace, all hjtd this impotent 
and exhauste&lt;l clmntcter. All tlie sjings, some mulodies of which have 
been preserved, were hunihk: and kmientable unto weeping. The

contents itself with a sigh ; one of its groans has come down to us : 
*‘Je n’entrave que le dail comment meek, le daron des argues, pent 
atiger ses momes et ses momignards et les locher criblant sans etre 
agite lui-mSme.” ^ The miserable being, whenever he has time to re- 
flect, imagines himself mean before the law and wretched before 
society ; he prostrates himself, he begs, he turns towards pity ; we 
feel that he recognises that he is wrong. 

Towards the middle of the last century, there was a change. The 
prison songs, the robbers’ ritornels acquired, so to speak, an insolent 
and jovial expression. The plaintive malurS was supplanted by the 
larifla. We find in the eighteenth century, in almost all the songs of 
the galleys, the. chain-gangs, and the prisons, a diabolical and enig- 
matic gaiety. We hear this boisterous and ringing refrain, which one 
would say was lighted with a phosphorescent gleam, and which 
seems as if it were thrown forth upon the forest by a will-o’-the- 
wisp playing the fife : 


MirlababI surlababo 
Mirliton ribonribette 
Starlababi mirlababo 
Mirliton ribonribo. 

This was sung while cutting a man’s throat in a cave or in the 
edge of a forest. 

A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century the old melancholy 
of these gloomy classes is dissipated. They began to laugh. They 
ridicule the great meg and the grd&amp;t dab. Speaking of Louis XV. 
they call the King of France' “the Marquis of Pantin.” They are 
almost cheerful. A sort of flickering light comes from these 
wretches, as if conscience ceased to weigh upon them. These pitiful 
tribes of the darkness have no longer the desperate audacity of deeds 
merely, tliey have the reckless audacity of mind. A sign that they are 
losing the perception of their criminality, and that they feel even 
among thinkers and dreamers some mystewous support which is 
isnconsciously given. A si^ that pillage and robbery are beginning 
to infiltrate even into doctrines and sophisms, in such a way as to lose 
something of their ugliness by giving much of it to the sophisms 
and the doctrines. A sign in short, if no diversion arises, of some 
prodigious and speedy outburst. 

Let us pause for a moment. Whom are we accusing here? is it the ’ 
eighteenth century ? is it its philosophy ? Certainty not. The work of 
the eighteenth century is sound and good. The Encyclopaedists, Di- 
derot at their head, the physiocratists, Turgot at their head, the

ljhil{&gt;sophers, Voltiiire at their head, the uttipists, Rousseau at their 
head: these are four sacred legions. To them the immense advance 
of humanity towards the light is due. 'Hiey are the four vanguards 
of the human race going to the^ four cardinal points of progress, 
Diderot towtirds the beautiful, Turgot lowtirds the useful, Voltaire 
towards the true, Rousseau towards ihe just. But liesidc and beneath 
the philosophers, there were the sopiiisfs, a poisonous vegetation 
mingled with the he;ilthy growth, hemlock in the virgin forest. 
While the executioner was burning uj)on the cliicf st.'iircase of the 
Palais de Ju.stice the grand liberating hook.s of tlie century, writers 
now forgotten were piihlisliing, with the privilege of the king, many 
strangely disorganising writings greedily read by the outcast. Some 
of these puljliciitions, stninge to say, patronised hj* a prince, are still 
in the BihUofhiujue .VernVe, 'riicst; fticts, dw'p ro&lt;ited, but ignored,

Germany than anywhere else. In Gennaiiy, dtiring a certain period, 
.summed up by Schiller in Ills famous dnima, 77ic Robbers, robbery 
and plunder, eleviUcd into a protest against property and labour,

(lisapjteared in them in .some sort, took ,a«i abstract name, and passed

dent chemists who had prepared the, mixture, ttnknown even to the

serious. Suffering engenders wrath; ami while the pro.sperous 
clttsses hliml ihemst'Ives, or {.all asleep, which also is to close the 
eyes, the hatred of the tnifortumite classes lights its torch at some

This danger, finminent jterhaps in Europe towards the end of 
the eighteenth century, wa.s cut sh«»rt l»y the French Revolution, 
that immense act of probity. 

The French Revolution, which i.s nothing more ntir less than the 
ideal armed with the sword, started to its feet, and by the very 
.novement, closed the door of evil and opened the door or good- 



SAINT BENIS 841 

It cleared up the question, promulgated truth, drove away miasma, 
purified the century, crowned the people. 

We may say of it that it created man a second time, in giving him 
a second soul, his rights. 

The nineteenth century inherits and profits by its work, and to- 
day the social catastrophe which we just now indicated is simply 
impossible. Blind is he who prophesies it ! Silly is he who dreads it ! 
Revolution is vaccination for Jacquerie. 

Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions are changed. The 
feudal and monarchical diseases are no longer in our blood. There is 
nothing more of the Middle Ages in our constitution. We live no 
longer in the times when frightful interior swarms made eruption, 
when men heard beneath their feet the obscure course of a sullen 
sound, when there appeared on the surface of civilisation some mys- 
terious uprising of molehills, when the soil cracked, when the mouths 
of caverns opened, and when men saw monstrous heads spring sud- 
denly from the earth. 

The revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of rights, 
developed, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is liberty, 
which end&amp; where the liberty of others begins, according to Robes- 
pierre’s admirable definition. Since ’89, the entire people has been 
expanding in the sublimated individual ; there is no poor man, who, 
having his rights, has not his ray ; the starving man feels within 
himself the honour of France ; the dignity of the citizen is an interior 
armour ;.he who is free is scrupulous ; he who votes reigns. Hence 
incorruptibility ; hence the abortion of unnoxious lusts ; hence the.- 
eyes heroically cast down before temptations. The revolutionary 
purification is such that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, or a 
10th of August, there is no longer a mob. The first cry of the en* 
lightened and enlarging multitudes is : death to robbers ! Progress 
is an honest man; the ideal and the absolute pick no pockets. By 
whom in 1848 were the chests escorted which contained the riche? 
of the Tuileries ? by the rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint Antoine*. 
The rag mounted guard over the treasure. Virtue made these tatters' 
resplendent. There was there, in those chests, in boxes hardly closed, &gt; 
some even half open, amid a hundred dazzling caskets, that old crown 
of France all in diamonds, surmounted by the regent’s carbuncle oi 
royalty, which was worth thirty millions. Barefooted they guarded 
that crown. 

No more Jacquerie then. I regret it on account of the able. That ia 
the old terror which has had its last effect, and which can never 
henceforth be employed in politics. The great spring of the red 
spectre is broken. Everybody knows dt now. The scarecrow no 
longer scares. The birds take liberties with the puppet, the beetles 
make free with it, the bourgeois laugh at it.

THE TWO DUTIES : TO WATCH AND TO HOPE 

This being so, is all social danger dissipated ? Certain^ not. No 
Jacquerie. Society may be reassured on that account ; the blood' will 
rush to its head no more, but let it take thought as to the manner of 
its breathing. Apople.Ky is no longer lo be feared, but consumption 
is there. The consumption of society js called misery. 

We die undermined as well as .stricken down. 

Let us not weary of repeating it, to think linst of all of the outcast 
and sorrowful multitudes, to solace them, to give them air, to en- 
lighten them, to love them, to enliirge their horizon magnificently, 
to lavish upon them education in till its forms, to olTer them the ex- 
ample of labour, never the e.\ami&gt;le of i&lt;lU;ness, to diminish the 
weight of the individual burden by intensifying the idea of the 
universial object, to limit poverty without limiting wealth, to create 
vast fields of public and popidar activity, to have, like Briareus, a 
hundred hands to stretch out on all siiles to the exhausted and the 
feeble, to employ the collective power in tlie grt?at duty of opening 
workshoi)s for all arms, schools for all ai&gt;tiludes ttud laboratories 
for all intelligences, to increase wages, to diminish sulTcring, to bal- 
ance the ought and the have, that is to .say, to proportion enjoyment 
to clTort and gratification to need, in tuu; word, to evolve from the 
social structure, for the heneiit of those who .sulTer and those who 
are ignorant, more light and more comfort ; this is, let sympathetic 
souls forget it not, the first of fraternal obligations, this is, let sel- 
fish hearts know it, the first of poIitii:aI tiece.ssities. 

And, we must say, all that is only a heginning. The true state- 
ment is this : labour cannot lie a law without being a right. 

We do not dwell upon it ; this is not the place. 

If nature is called providence, society should he called foresight. 

Intellectual and moral growth is not less indispeiusable than ma- 
terial amelioration. Knowledge is a vi;iticnm, thought is of primary 
necessity, truth i.s nouri-shnient as well as wheat. A rea.son, by fasting 
from knowledge and wisdom, becomes puny. Let us lament as over 
stomachs, over minds which do not etit. If tliere is anything mors 
poignant than a bo&lt;ly agonising for want of bread, it is a soul which 
IS dying of hunger for light. 

All progress is tetuling towards the .solution. Some day we shall be 
astounded. The human race rising, the lower strata will quite nat- 
urally come out from the zone of distress. The almlition of misery 
will brought about by a simple elevation of level. 

This blessed solution, we .should do wrong to di.strust. 

^ The pa.st, it is true, is very strong at the jiresent hour. It is re- 
viving. This revivification of a corpse is surprising. Here it is walk*

ing and advancing. It seems victorious ; this dead man is a conqueror. 
He comes with his legion, the superstitions, with hi3 sword, despo- 
tism, with his banner, ignorance ; within a little time he has won ten 
battles. He advances, he threatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Ao 
for ourselves, we shall not despair. Let us sell the field whereon Han* 
nibal is camped. 

We who believe, what can we fear ? 

There is no backward flow of ideas more than of rivers. 

But let those who desire not the future, think of it. In saying no 
to progress, it is not the future which they condemn, but themselves. 
They give themselves a melancholy disease; they inoculate them- 
selves with the past. There is but one way of refusing To-morrow, 
that is to die. 

Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the 
soul never, is what we desire. 

Yes, the enigma shall say its word, the sphinx shall speak, the 
problem shall be resolved. Yes, the people, rough-hewn by the eight- 
eenth century, shall be completed by the nineteenth. An idiot is he 
who doubts it ! The future birth, the speedy birth of universal well- 
being, is a divinely fatal phenomenon. 

Immense pushings together rule human affairs and lead them all 
in a given time to the logical condition, that is to say, to equilibrium ; 
that is to say to equity. A force composite of earth and of Heaven 
results from humanity and governs it; this force is a worker of 
miracles ; miraculous issues are no more difficult to it than extraor- 
dinai’y changes. Aided by science which comes from man, and by 
the event which comes from Another, it is little dismayed by those 
contradictions in the posture of problems, which seem impossibilities 
to the vulgar. It is no less capable of making a solution leap forth 
from the comparison of ideas than a teaching from the comparison 
of facts, and we may expect everything from this mysterious power 
of progress, which some fine day confronts the Orient with the Oc- 
cident in the depths of a sepulchre, and makes the Imaums talk with 
Bonaparte in the interior of the great pyramid. 

In the meantime, no halt, no hesitation, no interruption in the 
grand mai'ch of minds. Social philosophy is essentially science and 
peace. Its aim is, and its result must be, to dissolve angers by the 
study of antagonisms. It examines, it scrutinises, it analyses ; then it 
recomposes. It proceeds by way of reduction, eliminating hatred 
from all. 

That a society may be swamped in a gale which breaks loose over 
men has been seen more than once ; history is full of shipwrecks of 
peoples and of empires ; customs, laws, religions, some fine day, the 
mysterious hurricane passes by and sweeps them all away. The 
civilisations of India, Chaldea, Persia, Assyria,, Egypt, have disap- 
peared, one nfter the other. Why? we kno.w not. What are the causes

The reader has understood that Eponine, having recognised through 
the grating the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet, to which Magnon 
had sent her, had begun by diverting the bandits from the Rue 
‘Plumet, had then conducted Marius thither, and that after several 
days of ecstasy before that grating, Marius, drawn by that force 
which pushes the iron towards the magnet and the lover towards 
the stones of which the house of her whom he loves it built, had 
finally entered Cosette’s garden as Romeo did the garden of Juliet. 
It had even been easier for him than for Romeo ; Romeo was obliged 
to scale a wall, Marius had only to push aside a little one of the bars 
of the decrepit grating, which was loosened in its rusty socket, like 
■ the teeth of old people. Marius was slender, and easily passed 
through. 

As there was never anybody in the street, and as, moreover, Ma- 
rius entered the garden only at night, he ran no risk of being seen. 

From that blessed and holy hour when a kiss affianced these two 
souls, Marius came every evening. If, at this period of her life, Co- 
sette had fallen into the love of a man who was unscrupiflpus and : 
■a libertSne, she would have been ruined; for there are generous 
natures which give themselves, and Cosette was one. One of the 
magnanimities of woman is to yield. Love, at that height at which it 
is absolute, is associate4 with an inexpressibly celestial blindness of 
modesty. B,ut what risks do you run, O noble souls ! Often, you give 
the heart, we take the body. Your hea.rt remains to you, and you look 
upon it in the darkness, and shudder. Love has no middle term ; either 
Jt destroys, or it siyes. All human destiny is this dilemma. This 
dilemma, destruction or salvation, no fatality proposes more inexor- 
ably than love. Love is life, if it be not death. Cradle; coffin also. 
The same sentiment sayS yes and no in the human heart. Of all the 
things which God has made, the human heart is that Which sheds 
mostlight, and, alas! most night. 

God willed tha:t the love which Cosette met, should be one of

Through all the month of May of that year 1832, there were there, 
every night, in that poor, wild garden, iniiler that .shrulibery each 
day more odorous and more dense, two heings composed of every 
chastity and every innocence, overllowing with all the felicities of 
Heaven, more nearly .archangels than men, pure, noble, intoxicated, 
radiant, who were resplendent to each other in the darkness. It 
seemed to C'osette that Marins had .a crown, and to Marins that Co- 
sette iiad a halo. 'I'liey touched e.adi other, they Itchcld each other, 
they clasped each other’s hanils, they presseti closely to each other; 
but there was a tlistaiice which tliev did not jiass. Not that they re- ■ 
spected it ; they were ignorant &lt;if it. Marins felt a harrier, the purity 
of Cosetle, and l.'usette fell :i support, the loyalty t)f Marius. The 
I'.rst kiss was the Last .also. Mai ins, sin.a', ha 1 not gone heyoiul toiich- 
in.g Cosette’s hand, nr her lu-ekereldef . or her ringlets, with his lips, 
Coselte A'as to him a perfume, .and not a woman. 1 !e breathed her. 
She refuse«l nothing .and he le ked nothing. I 'osi’ite was happy, and, 
Maritts was sjitiidied. They iiveil in that ravishing eonditioii which 
might he called llic d.ai'aling of a .soiil hy .a .soul. It was lliat inelTable 
first emiiraceof two virginities in the it leal. Two swans meeting upon 
the Jun.g frail. 

At that liour tif love, an hour when tiassioii is ahsohitely silent 
tnuler the oinnipttlenva* of eistasy, Marius, the pure anti seraphic 
Marins, woiiK! have luen ca}iahle railna' of visiting a pnhlic woman 
of lifting t'osette’s dress to the height of her ankle. Once, on a , 
moonlight night, (atsette stoopeii ita pick up stiniething from the" 
ground, her dress lousemat am! tlisitl.ayeil t he n 'inniing of her bosom. 
M.arius turned awtty his eyes. 

What passw! heiwecn these two heinipo^ N’othing. I'hey were 
adoring' e.ach tither. 

At night, when they were there, this i-,.aiaieii seemeil a living and 
sacretl pl.aee. ,411 the flowers opeiied .ah. tin tlieiii, ami protTered them 
their incense ; they too opened their souls .am! imiiretl tliem forth to 
the ilowers; the lusty .ami vigorous vegetation tremhhai full of sap 
and intoxication ahmit these two iiinoiaail ereartires, and they spoke 
words of love at whieh the trees thrillial. 

W’hat were these words ? \Miisper&gt;, nothing more. These whispers 
were enough to armise .*11111 ext-iir all this nnini e. A intigic power, 
which one can hardly underst.aiul hy titis prattle, which is made to 
he home away and dissijwtial like whiffs of smoke hy the wiml under 
the le.*tve.s. 'I'.ake from these jnurmiir.s tif two lover.s that melody 
which springs front the sotil. and which accompanies them like a 
lyre, what remahts is only a shatie, Vrm s;ty ; W'hfit ! is that all? Yes, 
childish things, repetitions, Innghs ahaul nothing, inutilities, absurd- 
ities, all that is tU-epesi and most sublime in the world ! the only 
things whidh are worth bring said and listened to. 

These absurdities, tltcse poverties, the man who has never heard 



SAINTDENIS 847 

them, the man who has never uttered them, is an imbecile and a 
wicked man. 

Cosette said to Marius : 

• ‘Do you know my name is Euphrasie ?” 

“Euphrasie? Why no,. your name is Cosette.” 

“Oh ! Cosette is such an ugly name that they gave me someho'vv 
when I was little. But my real name is Euphrasie. IDon’t you lilce 
that name, Euphrasie?” 

“Yes — ^but Cosette is not ugly.” 

“Do you like it better than Euphrasie ?” 

“Why— yes.”^ 

“Then I like it better, too. It is true it is pretty, Cosette. Call me 
Cosette.” 

And the smile which she added made of this dialogue an idyl 
worthy of a celestial grove. 

At another time she looked at him steadily and exclaimed : 

“Monsieur, you are handsome, you are beautiful, you are witty, 
you are not stupid in the least, you are much wiser than I, but I defy 
yon with this word : I love you !” 

And Marius, in a cloudless sl&lt;y, thought he heard a strophe sung 
by a star. 

Or again, she gave him a little tap because he coughed, and said 
to him : 

“Do not cough, monsieur. I do not allow coughing here without 
permission. It is very naughty to cough and disturb me. I want you 
to be well, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I should be 
very unhappy. What will you have me do for you !” 

And that was all purely divine. 

Once Marius said to Cosette : 

“Just think, I thought at one time that your name was Ursula.” 

This made them laugh the whole evening. 

In the midst of another convers^ition, he happened to exclaim: 

“Oh ! one day at the Luxembourg I would have been glad to break 
the rest of the bones of an Invalidel” 

But he stopped short and went no further. He would have been 
obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was impossible 
for him. There was an unknown coast there, the flesh, before which 
this immense innocent love recoiled with a kind of sacred awe. 

Marius imagined life with Cosette like this, without anything 
else : to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to put aside the com^ 
plaisant old bar of the president’s grating, to sit side by side upon 
this seat, to behold through the trees the scintillation of the com- 
mencing night, to make the fold of the knee of his pantaloons in- 
timate with the fulness of Cosette’s dress, to caress her thumbnail, 
to say dearest to her, to inhale one ofter the other the odour of the 
same flower, for ever^ indefinitely. During this time the clouds were

pa;;sing above their heafis. b'very brerUh i&gt;f wind bears away more 
dreams from man than clouds from tlm sky. 

'riiat tliis chaste, almost severe. love w;is ahsohilely without gal- 
lantry, we will not .s:iy. "To jwy cumiiliments’’ to her whom we love 
is the first method of caressing, ;i demi-:iud:icify venturing. A com- 
pliment is .something liki; a kiss through a veil. Pleasure sets her 
soft seal there, even wliile hilling herself, lleforc jdeasure the heart 
recoils, to love belter. Marins’ soft words, all satur.ated as they were 
with chimera, were, so tti .spe.ak, .sky bine, ’riie birds, when they 
are flying on high beside tint angels, must liear .sudi words. There 
was mingled with them, Itowm-er, life, humanity, all the positiveness 
of which Marins was c:ii&lt;:ible, It was what is s.aid in the grotto, a nre- 
htile to what will he said in llte alcovo : a lyrie/i! etinsion, the .s'trophe 
anil the .sonnet Miini'.led, the geinie liyperboles of eooing, all the re- 
rmcmentsof adoration arranged in .a iiotupn't and exhaling a subtle 
cclesli.'il perfume, an meiVable warbling of lioart to heart. 

‘‘Oh!" nmrmnred .Marins, "bow beatnifitl you are! I d.are not 
look at yon. 'riril is why 1 st.-ire at yoii. Von ;ii e :i gnaee. 1 do not 
know what i.s the m.itier with me. Tiie hem of yottr dress, when the

mtidemoiselle. ! study yonr feet with the microscope and your soul 
with the telescope.” 

Ami CosetU; answered: 

“I have l«:en loving you a little more every minute .since this 
morning.'' 

Qnesliun.s ;nid answers fared as they might iit tins dialogue, al- 
ways falling naturally at kef upon love, like lho.se loaded toy.s 
which always fall ttpoii their hast*. 

t'osette'.s whole person was ;ilertiiess, ingenmnistu'.s,s, transpar- 
ency, whiteness, cattdonr, rjidiance. W'e might say of tHsette that 
she wa.s fwllneid. She gave to liiin who saw lier a sensation of April 
and of dawn, There was dew in her eyes, i iiseite w.as a conden.sation 
of auroral light in womiinly form. . 

It was rjuitc nainra! that JIarhis, .adoring her, should .ndinire her. 
Bui; the trnth is tliat this liiile .schmulgirl, fresli from the convent

a woman how to .say things at the same time sweet and profound. 
Sweetnras ami rleptli, this is all of woman ; this is .'ill of He.avcn. 

In this fulness of felicity, at eveiy instant iear.s came to their eyra. 



SAINTDENIS 849 

An insect trodden upon, a feather falling from a nest, a twig of 
hawthorn broken, moved their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly 
drowned in melancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. 
The most sovereign symptom of love, is a tenderness sometimes 
almost insupportable. ' 

And, by the side of this — all these contradictions are the lightning 
play of love — they were fond of laughing, and laughed with a 
charming freedom, and so familiarly that they sonietimes seemed 
almost like two boys. Nevertheless, though hearts intoxicated with 
chastity may be all unconscious, nature, who can never be forgotten,' 
is always present. There she is, with her aim, animal yet sublime ; 
and whatever may be the innocence of souls, we feel, in the most 
modest intercourse, the adorable and mysterious shade which 
separates a couple of lovers from a pair of .friends. 

They worshipped each other. 

The permanent and the immutable continue. There is loving, 
there is smiling and laughing, and little pouts with the lips, and inter- 
lacing of the fingers, and fondling speech, yet that does not hinder 
eternity. Two lovers hide in the evening, in the twilight, in the in- 
visible with the birds, with the roses, they fascinate each other in 
the shadow with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, they 
murmur, they whisper, and during all this time immense librations 
of stars fill infinity.

THE STUPEFACTION OF COMPLETE HAPPINESS 

Their existence was vague, bewildered with happiness. They did 
not perceive the cholera which decimated Paris that very month. 
They had been as confidential with each other as they could be, but 
this had not gone very far beyond their names, Marius had tbld 
Cosette that he was an orphan, that his name was Marius Pont- 
mercy, that he was a lawyer, that he lived by writing things for pub- 
lishers, that his father was a colonel, that he was a hero, and that 
he, Marius, had quarrelled with his grandfather who was rich. He 
had also said something about being a baron ; but that had produced 
no effect upon Cosette. Marius baron! She did not comprehend. She 
did not know what that Word meant. Marius was Marius. On her 
part she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the 
Convent of the Petit Picpus, that her mother was dead as well as 
his, that her father’s name was M., Fauchelevent, that he was very 
kind, that he gave much to the poor, but that he was poor himself, 
and that he deprived himself of everything while he deprived her of 

nothing. . , 

Strange to say, in the kind of symphony in which Manus had, 



850 L E S M I S £ R A B L E S 

been living since he had seen Cosclle, tlic ])ast, even the most recent 
had become so confused and distant to him that what Cosettetolci 
him satisfied him fully. He did not even think to speak to her of the 
night adventure at the Gorlx'au tcMU/mcnl, the Thenardiers, the 
burning, and the strange attitude and the singular flight of her father. 
Marius had temporaril}" forgotten all that ; lie did not even know at 
night what he had done in the morning, nor wliere he had break- 
fasted, nor who had spoken to him ; he had songs in his ear which 
rendered him deaf to every other thought ; he existed only during the 
hours in which he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in Heaven, it was 
quite natural that he should forget the earth. They were both sup- 
porting with languor the undefinable burden of the immaterial 
pleasures. Thus live these somnambulists called lovers. 

Alas ! who has not cxptTienced all tlusse things? why comes there 
an hour when we leave this a&gt;cure, ami why does life continue after- 
wards ? 

Love almost replaces thtnight. Love is a hiirning forgetfulness 
of all else. Ask logic then of passion. There is no more an absolute 
logical chain in the human lH‘art tlian there is a tier feet geometrical 
figure in ihe celestial mechanics. I'o Cosette and Marius there was 
nothing in lieing lieyond Marins and ( osetie. The'-universe about 
diem had fallen out of sight. Tliey livinl in a golden moment. There 
was nothing before, nothing afitT. It is doubtful if Marius thought 
whether C'osette had a iather. I le was so da/zled that all was effaced 
from his brain. Of what then did they talk, these lovers? We have 
seen, of the flowers, the swallows, the st*Uiug sun, the rising of the 
moon, of all important things. Tht.‘y ha&lt;I tolcl all, excejit everything. 
The all of lovers is nothing. But the father, the realities, the garre\ 
those bandits, that adventure, what was tlie use? and was he quite 
certain that that nightmare was real? Tlity were two, tliey adored 
each other, there was nothing hut tliat. Ivverylhing else was not. It 
is prohalile that this oblivion of the hell liehind us is a part of arrival 
at paradise. Have we seen demons ? are there any ? have we trembled ? 
have we suffert'd? We know nothing now about that. A rosy cloud 
rests upon it all. 

These two beings, then, w&lt;Te living thus, very high, with all the 
improbaliility of naUire ; neither at tlie nadir nor at the zenith, be- 
tween man and the seraph, above eartli, Inflow the ether, in the cloud ; 
scarcely flesh and bone, soul and ecstasy from head to foot; too 
sublimated already to walk Ujion the earllgand yet too much weighed 
down with humanity to di.sappear in the sky, in suspension like 
atoms which are awaiting precipitation ; apparently outside of des- 
tiny; ignoring that lieaten track yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; 
astounded, swnnj):ng, floating ; at times, Iiglil enough to soar into the 
infinity; almost ready for the eternal flight. 



SAINTDENIS SSl 

They were sleeping awake in this rocking cradle. O splendid leth- 
,irgy of the real overwhelmed by the ideal ! 

Sometimes, beautiful as was Cosette, Marius closed his eyes be- 
fore her. With closed eyes is the best way of looking at the soul. 

Marius and Cosette did not ask where this would lead them. They 
looked upon themselves as arrived. It is a strange demand for men t&lt;? 
ask that love should anywhither. 


SHADOW COMMENCES 

Jean Valjkan suspected nothing. 

Cosette, a little less dreamy than Marius, was cheerful, and that 
was enough to make Jean Valjean happy. The thoughts of Cosette, 
her tender preoccupations, the image of Marius which filled her 
soul, detracted nothing from the incomparable purity of her beauti- 
ful, chaste, and smiling forehead. She was at the age when the 
maiden bears her love as the angel bears her lily. And then when 
two lovers have an understanding they always get along well ; any 
third person who might disturb their love, is kept in perfect blind- 
ness by a very few precautions, always the same for all lovers. Thus 
never any objections from Cosette to Jean Valjean. Did he wish to 
take a walk ? yes, my dear father. Did he wish to remain at home? 
very well. Would he spend the evening with Cosette ? she was in 
raptures. As he always retired at ten o'clock, at such times Marius 
would not come to the garden till after that hour, when from the 
street he would hear Cosette open the glass-door leading out on 
the steps. We need not say that Marius was never met by day, Jean 
Valjean no longer even thought that Marius was in existence. Once, 
only, one morning, he happened to say to Cosette : ^ Why, you have 
something white on your backf The evening before, Marius* in a 
^ transport, had pressed Cosette against the wall 

(“)ld Iknissaint who went to bed early, thought of nothing but 
going to sleep, once her work was done, and was ignorant of all,* like 
Jean Valjean. 

Never did Marius set foot into the house. When he was with 
Cosette they hid themselves in a recess near the steps, so that they 
could neither be seen nor heard from the street, and they sat there, 
contenting themselves often, by way of conversation, with pressing 
each other's hands twenty times a minute while looking^ into the 
branches of the trees* At such moments, a thunderbolt might hz'^rt 
fallen within thirty paces of them, and they would not have sus- 
pected it, so deeply was the reverie of the one 
the reverie of the other* ' ' 



852 L E S M I S E R A B L K S 

Limpid purities. Hours all while, almost all alike. Such loves as 
these are a collection of lily leaves and clove-down. 

The whole garden was between theni and the street. Whenever 
Marius came in and went out, he cartd'itlly n‘placed the bar of the 
grating in such a way that no derang&lt;‘ment was visible. 

He went away commonly abotit midnight, returning to Coiirfey- 
rac’s, Courfeyrac saiil t() 1 kihorel : 

^^Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one 
o’clock in the mortiing/’ 

Bahorel answered : 

**What would you ex])ect ? every ytamg person has his wild oats.” 

At times Courfeyrac folded his artns, asstnned a serious air, and 
said to Marius : ^ ^ 

**You are getting dissipated, young man !” 

Courfeyrac, a ])raclieal man, w«as tiot pleased at this reflection of 
an invisible paradise upoti Marius ; he had little tast&lt;‘ for unpublished 
passions, he was impatient at tliem, and hc» occasionally would serve 
Marius with a summons to return to the nsnl. 

One morning, he threw &lt;nit this admonition : 

**My dear fellow, yotj strike me at prescait as iHung situated in 
the moon, kingdom of dream, province of ilhision, capital Soap- 
Bubble. CMine, be a ginxl boy, what is her name 

Ihit: notliing ciMiId make ilarius ‘‘confess.** Nknt might have torn 
his nails out stioru?r than one at tlie two saered syllables which com- 
posed that ineffable name, C Vm‘c//c. 1*rne Un*e is luminous as the 
dawn, and silent as the grave. Only tliere was, to Courfeyrac, this 
change in Marius, that lie had a nidiani taciturnity. 

During this sweet month tff ^May, Marius and Cosetle knew these 
transceiulent joys ; 

To (ptarrel and to say monsieur and mailemoisidle, merely to say 
Marius and Cosette better afterwards; 

talk at lenglli, and with most mimtte detail, of people who did 
not interest them in the least : a further proid that, in this ravishing, 
opera which is called have, the liiiretio is almost notliing ; 

h\&gt;r Marius, to listen to Cosette talking dress ; 

For Cosette, to listen to Marins Calking jHditics; 

To hear, knee ttniching knee, the waggons rtdl along the Rue de 
Bahylone ; 

To gar.e ujum the saint* jdanel in space, or the same worm glow in 
the grass ; 

To keep silence together; a pleasure still greater than to talk; 

■ , Ktc„ etc. 

Meanwhile various complications were approaching. 

One evening Maritis was making his way to the rendesKvous by the 
Boulevard des Invalides ; he ustinlly walked with Ins head bent down ; 



SAINT DENIS 853 

as he was just turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some 
one saying very near him : 

‘‘Good evening, Monsieur Marius.” 

He looked up, and recognised Eponine. 

This produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought 
even once of this girl since the day she brought him to the Rue Plu- 
met, he had not seen her again, and she had completely gone out of 
his mind. He had motives of gratitude only towards her ; he owed 
his present happiness to her, and still it was annoying to him to meet 
her. 

It is a mistake to suppose that passion, when it is fortunate and 
pure, leads man to a state of perfection; it leads him simply, as we 
have said, to a state of forgetfulness. In this situation man forgets 
to be bad, but he also forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, necessary 
and troublesome memories, vanish; A t any other time Marius would 
have felt very differently towards Eponine. Absorbed in Cosette, 
he had not even clearly in his mind that this Eponine’s name was 
Eponine Thenardier, and that she bore a name written in his father’s 
will, that name to which he would have been, a few months before, 
so ardently devoted. We show Marius just as he was. His father 
himself, disappeared somewhat from his soul beneath the splendour 
of his love. 

He answered with some embarrassment : 

“What ! is it you, Eponine ?” 

“Why do you speak to me so sternly ? Have I done anything to 
you?” 

“No,” answered he. 

Certainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt 
that he could not do otherwise, now that he had whispered to Co- 
sette, than speak coldly to Eponine. 

As he was silent, she exclaimed : 

“Tell me now — ” , 

Then she stopped. It seemed as if words failed this creature, once 
so reckless and so bold. She attempted to smile and could not. She 
resumed : 

«Well?— ” 

Then she was silent again, and stood with her eyes cast down. 

“Good evening, Monsieur Marius,” said she all at once abruptly^ 
and she went away.

CAB ROLLS IN ENGLISH AND YELPS IN ARGOT 

The next day, it was the 3rd of June, the 3rd of June, 1832, a date 
which must be noted on account of the grave events which were at 
that time suspended over the horizon of Paris like thunder-clouds. 



854 L K S M I S JC K A » L K S 

Marius, at nightfall, was following the same path as the evennw 
before, with the same rajiturous thoiiglii.s in Ih.s heart, when he per- 
ceived, under the trees of the houlcvard, If]&gt;onine approachint' him' 
Two days in succession, this was too much. 1 le turned hastily left 
the boulevard, changed his route, and went to the Rue PlumBt 
through the .Rue Mtmsieur. 

This caused liponine to follow him to tiie Rue Plumet, a thin? 
which she. had not done before. Siie had been content nntil then to 
see him on his way through the boulevard without even .scekino' to 
meet him. The evening [trevii ms, only, had she t rital to speak to him 

Eponine followed him then, without a suspicion on his part. She 
saw him push .aside the bar of tlie grating, and glide into the irai-den 

“Why!” .said she, “he is going into the lioti.se." 

She approached tlte grating, ftdt of tlie bars one after another, and 
easily recognised the one which Marins had di.Hplaced. 

ShcMunrmurcd in an undertone, with a mournful accent: 

“None of that, Lisette!” 

She .s.at down upon the ,stirh.ase &lt;4 the grating, close beside the 
bar, as if she were guarding it. It was just at the jiuint at which the 
grating joined the neiglihonriug wall. There w.as an obscure corner 
there, ill which liponine wa.s enliiely liidden. 

She remained thus for more tlian an hour, withmit: stirring and 
without breathing, a prey to her own thoughl.s. 

Al»ont ten o’clock in fiie evening, one of tlie two or three passers 
in the Hue Plumet, a belaUsi oki Itotirgeoi.s who was hurrying through 
this de.sefted and ill-famed |ilace. keeping along the garilen grating 
on reaching the angle which tlte grating made with the wall, heard a 
sullen and thretitening voice whi«ii : 

“1 wouldn’t Ih* .surjiriset] if he canin every evening!'’ 

J ie cast his eyes ahout him, saw iitihofly, tiareil not look into that 
dtirk corner, and wtis very mncli frigliiened, 1 h: doubled his jace. 

This person had re.tson to hasleii, for a very few moments after- 
wards sis nieii, who were walking separalely tnid at some distance 
frunt each other along the wall, ainl who might have been taken for a 
tijisy jKttrol. entered the Rue I’liimei, 

1 he first to arrive at the grating of tin* garden slopped and waited 
for the others; in a second liiey were ttll six together. 

These men began in talk in a low voice. 

“It i-s iV/VtiiV/c,’’ said one of iheiii. 

“Is there a t'tih ' in the garden'"" asked another. 

“1 &lt;lon'l know. At all events I Itave Atc ■* .a hnllet which we will

‘‘Yes/’ 

“The grating is old/’ added a fifth, who had a voice like a ventrilo- 
ijuist. 

“So much the better/’ said the second who had spoken. “It will 
not crihlcra ^ under the bastringue,^ and will not be so hard to fait- 
cher.^ 

The sixth, who had not yet opened his mouth, began to examine 
the grating as Eponine had done an hour before, grasping each bar 
successively and shaking it carefully. In this way he came to the bar 
which Marius had loosened. Just as he was about to lay hold of this 
bar, a hand, starting abruptly from the shadow, fell upon his arm, 
he felt himself pushed sharply back by the middle of his breast, and 
a roughened voice said to him without crying out : 

“There is a cahJ' 

At the same time he saw a pale girl standing before him. 

The man felt that commotion which is always given by the un- 
expected. He bristled up hideously; nothing is so frightful to see as 
ferocious beasts which are startled, their appearance when terrified 
is terrifying. He recoiled, and stammered : 

“What is this creature?” 

. “Your daughter.” 

It was indeed Eponine who was speaking to Thenardier. 

On the appearance of Eponine the five others, that is to say, Cla- 
quesous, Gueulemer, Babet, Montparnasse, and Brujon, approached 
without a sound, without haste, without saying a word, with the 
ominous slowness peculiar to these men of the night. 

In their hands might be distinguished some strangely hideous 
tools. Gueulemer had one of those crooked crowbars which the 
prowlers call fanchons. 

“Ah, there, what are you doing here ? what do you want of us ? are 
you crazy ?” exclaimed Thenardier, as much as one can exclaim in 
a whisper. “What do you come and hinder us in our work for ?” 

Eponine began to laugh and sprang to his neck. 

“I am here, my darling father, because I am here. Is there any 
law against sitting upon the stones in these days ? It is you who 
shouldn’t be here. What are you coming here for, since it is a bis- 
cuit ? I told Magnon so. There is nothing to do here. But embrace 
me now, my dear good father ! What a long time since I have seen 
you ! You are out then ?” 

Thenardier tried to free himself from Eponine’s arms, and mut- 
tered : 

“Very well. You have embraced me. Yes, I am out. I am not in 
Now, be off.”

But Eponine did not loose her hold and rctloul)led her caresses. 

“My darling father, how &lt;lid^you do it? You must have a good 
deal of wit to get out of that! Tell me about it 1 And my mother? 
where is my mother ? Give mo some news of mamma.” 

Thenardier answered : 

“.She is well, I don’t know, let me alone, T tell you to be off.” 

“I don’t want t(-&gt; go away just now," said Eponine, with the pet- 
tishness of a spoiled child, “you send me away when here it is four 
months that I haven’t seen you, and when i have hardly had time to 
emlmace you.” 

And she caught her father again bv the neck. 

“Ah! come now, this is foolish,” said Baltet. 

“l -et us hurry I’’ said ( Ineuleuitir, “tlie coquciin may come along.” 

The ventriloijuist .sang this &lt;Ustich:

Eponine turiusl towards the live bandits. 

“\Vhy,llits is .Vlonsieur Bnijnii. ( lot id-ilay, ’Monsieur Babet.Good-

“\'es, they recognise you." sai&lt;! Thenardier. “But good-day, good-

“It is the hour for foxes, am! not for pullets,” said Montparnasse. 

“You .sec well enougli that w«' are going to gonpiner icigo,’’* ad- 
ded Babet, 

Eponine took Montparnasse's band. 

“Take care,” .said he, “you will cut yoursidf, T have a Ungre*

“My dtirling Motitpaniasse." answi‘red Eponine very gently, “we

'^No, The people have moved away/’ 

‘‘The candles have not, anyhow !” said Babet. 

And he showed Eponine, through the top of the trees, a light which ' 
was moving about in the garret of the cottage. It was Toussaint, who 
had sat up to hang out her clothes to dry. 

Eponine made a final effort. 

“Well,” said she, “they are very poor people, and it is a shanty 
where there isn’t a sou.” 

“Go to the devil !” cried Thenardier. “When we have turned the 
house over, and when we have put the cellar at the top and the gar- 
ret at the bottom, we will tell you what there is inside, and whether 
it is halles, ronds, or brogues/' ^ 

And he pushed her to pass by. 

“My good friend Monsieur Montparnasse,” said Eponine, “I 
beg you, you who are a good boy, don’t go in !” 

“Take care, you will cut yourself,” replied Montparnasse. 

Thenardier added, with his decisive tone : 

“Clear out, fee, and let men do their work !” 

Eponine let go of Montparnasse’s hand, which she had taken 
again, and said : 

“You will go into that house then ?” 

“Just a little !” said the ventriloquist, with a sneer. 

Then she placed her back against the grating, faced the six 
bandits who were ai'med to the teeth, and to^ whom the night gave 
faces of demons, and said in a low and firm voice : 

“Well, I, I won’t have it.” , 

They stopped astounded. The ventriloquist, however, finished his 
sneer. She resumed. 

“Friends ! listen to me. That isn’t the thing. Now I speak. In the 
firk place, if you go into the graden, if you touch this grating, I 
shall cry out, I shall rap on doors, I shall wake everybody up, I shall 
have all six of your arrested, I shall call the sergents de ville.” 

“She would do it,” said Thenardier in a low tone to Brujon and 
the ventriloquist. 

She shook her head, and added : 

“Beginning with my father !” 

Th&amp;ardier approached, 

“Not so near, goodman!” said she. 

He drew back, muttering; between his teeth: “Why, what is the 
matter with her ?” and he added : 

“Slut!” 

She began to laugh in a terrible way : 

“As you will, you shall not go in, I am not the daughter of a dbg, 
for I am the daughter of a wolf . There are six of you, what is that 

1 Francs, sous, or farthings. 



858 LES MISERABLES 

to me? You are men. Now, I am a woman. I am not afraid of you, 
not a bit. I tell you that you shall not go into this house, because it 
does not please me. If you approach, I shall bark. I told you so, I 
am the cah, I don’t care for you. Go your ways, you annoy me. Go 
where you like, but don’t come here, 1 forbid it ! You have knives, I 
have feet and hands. That makes no difference, come on now !” 

She took a step towards the bandits, she was terrible, she began 
to laugh. 

“The devil ! I am not afraid. This summer, I shall be hungry ; this 
winter, I shall be cold. Are they fools, the.se geese of men, to think 
that they can make a girl afraid ! Of what ! afraid ? Ah, pshaw, in- 
deed ! Because you have hussies of mistresses who hide under the bed 
when you raise your voice, it won’t do here ! I, I am not afraid of 
anything!” 

She kept her eye fi.xed tipun Tlienardier, and said : 

“Not even you, father !” 

Then she went on, casting her ghastly hlood.shot eyes over the 
banditsS : 

“What is it to me wiiether somcliody picks me up to-morrow on 
the pavement of the Rue Plumet, beaten to deatli with a club by my 
father, or whether they find me in a year in the ditches of Saint 
Cloud, or at the He de Cygnes, among the old rotten rubbish and the 
dead dogs?” 

She was obliged to stojj ; a dry cough seized her, her breath came 
like a rattle from her narrow and feeble chest. 

She resumed : 

“I have but to cry out, they come, bang ! You are si.x ; but I am 
everybody,” 

Tlienardier made a movement towanls her. 

“ ’Broach not !” cried she. 

He stopped, and said to her mildly : 

“Well, no ; I will not ap{»ruacli, Init &lt;ion‘t speak so loud. Daughter, 
you want then to hinder us in our work ? Slijl we must earn our liv- 
ing. Have you no love for yoiir father now?” 

“You bother me,” said Epouine. 

“Still we mu.st live, we must eat-—-” 

“Die.” . ■ 

Saying which, she .sat down on the stirbase of the grating, hum- 
ming: 


M(jn bras si do&lt;lu,_ 
Ma jambe bw'ii faite, 
Kt !e temps perdu.' 


’ So plump is my arm, 
Myncg so well formed, 

Yet my time has no charm. 



SAINT DENIS 859 

She had her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she 
was swinging her foot with an air of indifference. Her dress was full 
of holes, and showed her sharp shoulder-blades. The neighbouring 
lamp lit' up her profile and her attitude. Nothing could be more res- 
olute or more surprising. 

The six assassins, sullen and abashed at being held in check by 
a girl, went under the protecting shade of the lantern and held coun- 
sel, with humiliated and furious shrugs of their shoulders. 

She watched them the while with a quiet yet indomitable air. 

‘‘Something is the matter with her,” said Babet. “Some reason. 
Is she in love with the cabf But it is a pity to lose it.Two women, an 
old fellow who lodges in a back-yard, there are pretty good curtains 
at the window^s. The old fellow must be a guinal} I think it is a good 
thing.” 

“Well, go in the rest of you,” exclaimed Montparnasse. “Do the 
thing. I will stay here with the girl, and if she trips ” 

He made the open knife which he had in his hand gleam in the 
light of the lantern. 

Thenardier said not a word and seemed ready for anything. 

Brujon, who was something of an oracle, and who had, as we 
know, “got up the thing,” had not yet spoken. He appeared thought- 
f ul. He had a reputation for recoiling from nothing, and they knew 
that he had plundered, from sheer bravado, a police station. More- 
over he made verses and songs, which gave him a great authority. 

Babet questioned him. 

“You don’t say anything, Brujon?” 

Brujon remained silent a minute longer, then he shook his head in 
several different ways, and at last decided to speak. 

“Here : I met two sparrows fighting this morning ; to-night, I run 
against a woman quarrelling. All this is bad. Let us go away.” 

They went away. 

As they Went, Montparnasse murmured : 

“No matter, if they had said so, I would have made her feel the 
weight of my hand.” 

Babet answered ; 

“Not 1. 1 don’t strike a lady.” 

At the corner of the street, they stopped and exchanged this enig- 
matic dialogue in a smothered voice : 

“Where are we going to sleep to-night ?” 

“Under Patm.” 2 

“Have you the key of the grating with you, Thenardier?” 

“Humph.” 

Eponine, who had not taken her eyes off from them, saw them 
turn back the way they had come. She rose and began to creep along

the walls and houses behind them. She followed tliem as far as the 
boulevard. There, they scjnirated, and s!ui saw these men sink away 
in the obscurity into which titey seemed tu melt. ^

THINV.S OK THE NIGHT 

After the departure of tlie l)aiu!its, the Rue Pluniet resumed its 
quiet night a|)])earanre. 

What had just taken [daet* in tliis street would not have astonished 
a forest. The trees, the copse, the lusath, the branches roughly in- 
tertangled, tlie tall grass, have a darkly mysterious existence; this 
wild multitude sees there siulden ajjparitious of the invisible; there

SAINT DENIS 

It was the first cloud in this wonderful dream. 

Marius’ first word was ; 

“What is the matter ?” 

“See.” 

Then she sat down on the seat near the stairs, and as he took his 
place all trembling beside her, she continued : 

“My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, that 
he had business, and that perhaps we should go away.” 

Marius shuddered from head to foot. 

When we are at the end of life, to die means to go away ; when we 
are at the beginning, to go away means to die. 

For six weeks Marius, gradually, slowly, by degrees, had been 
each day taking possession of Cosette. A possession entirely ideal, 
but thorough. As we have entirely explained, in the first love, the 
soul is taken far before the body; afterwards the body is taken far 
before the soul ; sometimes the soul is not taken at all ; the Faubla^, 
and the Prudhommes add ; because there is none ; but the sarcasm is 
fortunately a blasphemy. Marius then possessed Cosette, as minds 
possess ; but he wrapped her in his whole soul, and clasped her jeah 
ously with an incredible conviction. He possessed her smile, her 
breath, her perfume, the deep radiance of her blue eyes, the soft- 
ness of her skin when he touched her hand, the charming mark that 
she had on her neck, all her thoughts. They had agreed never to go 
to sleep without dreaming of each other, and they had kept their 
word. He possessed all Cosette’s dreams. He beheld untiringly, and 
he sometimes touched with his breath, the short hairs at the back of 
her neck, and he declared to himself that there was not one of those 
little hairs which did not belong to him, Marius. He gazed upon and 
adored the things which she wore, her knot of ribbon, her gloves, her 
cufiFs, her slippers, as sacred objects of which he was mastei. He 
thought that he was lord of those pretty shell-combs which she had 
in her hair, and he said to himself even, dim and confused stammer- 
ings of dawning desire, that there was not a thread of her dress, not 
a mesh in her stockings, not a fold of her corset, which was not his. 
At Cosette’s,side, he felt near his wealth, near his property, near his 
despot, and near his slave. It seemed as if they so mingled their souls, 
that if they desired to take them back again, it would have been im- 
possible to identify them. “This one is mine.” “No, it is mine.” “I 
assure you that you are mistaken. This is really 1.” “What you take 
for you, is I.” Marius was something which was a prt of Cosette, 
and Cosette was something which was a part of Marius. Marius felt 
Cosette living within him. To have Cosette, to possess Cosette, this 
to him was not separable from breathing. Into the midst of this 
faith, of this intoxication, of this virginal possession, marvellous 
and absolute, of this sovereignty, these words : “We are going away,” 



862 LESMIsflRABLES 

fell all at once, and the sharp voice of reality cried to him : “Cosette 
is not yours !” 

Marius awoke. For six weeks Marius had lived, as we have said 
outside of life; this word, going away, brought him roughly bade 
to it. 

He could not find a word. She said to him in her turn. 

“What is the matter ?” 

He answered so low that Cosette hardly heard him : 

“I don’t understand what you have said.” 

She resumed : 

“This morning my father told nie to arrange all my little affairs 
and to be ready, that he would give me his clothes to pack, that he 
was obliged to take a journey, that we were going away, that we must 
have a large trunk for me and a small one for him, to get all that 
ready within a week from now, and that we should go perhaps to 
England.” 

"But it is monstrous !” exclaimed Marius. 

It is certain that at that moment, in Marius’ mind, no abuse of 
power, no violence, no abomination of the most cruel tyrants, no ac- 
tion of Busiris, Tiberius, or Henry VIII., was equal in ferocity to 
this : M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter to England because he 
has business. 

He asked in a feeble voice : 

“And when would you start ?” 

“He didn’t say when.” 

"And when should you return ?” 

“He didn’t say when.” 

Marius arose, and .said coldly : 

“Cosette, shall you go ?” 

Cosette turned upon him her beautiful eyes full of anguish and 
answered with a sort of bewilderment: 

“Where?” 

“To England ? .shall you go ?’ ' 

“Why do you speak so to me ?” 

“I ask you if you .shall go?” 

“What would you have me do?” said she, clasping her hands. 

“So, you will go?” 

“If my father goes?” 

“So, you will go?” 

Cosette took Marius’ hand and presssed it without answering. 

“Very well,” .said Marius. “'Fhen I shall go elsewhere.” 

Cosette felt the meaning of this word still more than she under- 
stood it. She turned so pale that her face became white in the dark- 
ness, She stammered : 

"What do you mean?” 



SAINTDENIS 863 

Marius looked at her, then slowly raised his eyes towards heaven 
and answered : 

^‘Nothing/’ 

When his eyes were lowered, he saw Cosette smiling upon him. 
The smile of the woman whom, we love has a brilliancy which we 
can see by night. 

^"How stupid we are ! Marius, I have an idea.” 

W\^hat?” 

^^Go if we go ! I will tell you where ! Come and join me where I 
am!” 

Marius was now a man entirely awakened. He had fallen back 
into reality. He cried to Cosette : 

‘‘Go with you ? are you mad ? But it takes money, and I have none 1 
Go to England ? Why I owe now, I don't know, more than ten louis 
to Courfeyrac, one of my friends whom you do not know ! Why I 
have an old hat which is not worth three francs, I have a coat from 
which some of the buttons are gone in front, my shirt is all torn, 
my elbows are out, my boots let in the water ; for six weeks I have 
not thought of it, and I have not told you about it. Cosette 1 I am a 
miserable wretch. You only see me at night, and you give me your 
love ; if you should see me by day, you would give me a sou I Go to 
England? Ah 1 1 have not the means to pay for a passport I” 

He threw himself against a tree which was near by, standing with 
his arms above his head, his forehead against the bark, feeling neither 
the tree which was chafing his skin, nor the fever which was ham- 
mering his temples, motionless, and ready to fall, like a statue of 
Despair. 

He was a long time thus. One might remain through eternity in 
such abysses. At last he turned. He heard behind him a little stifled 
sound, soft and sad. 

It was Cosette sobbing. 

She had been weeping more than two hours while Marius had been 
thinking. 

He came to her, fell on his knees, tod, prostrating himself slowly, 
ne took the tip of her foot which peeped from under her dress and 
kissed it. 

She allowed it in silence. There are moments when woman accepts, 
like a goddess sombre and resigned, the religion of love. 

‘^Do not weep,” said he. 

She murmured : 

“Because I am perhaps going away, and you cannot come !” 

He continued : 

“Do you love me ?” 

She answered him by sobbing out that word of Paradise which 
is never more enrapturing than when it comes through tears : 

“I adore you.” 



864 L E S M I S E R A B I. E S 

He continued with a tone of voice which was an inexpressible 
caress : ^ 

not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, not to weep?” 

*‘Do you love me, too?” said she. 

He caught her hand. 

^‘Cosette, I have never given my word of honotir to anybody, be- 
cause I stand in awe of my word of honour, I feed that my father is 
at my side. Now, 1 give you niy most sacred word of honour that 
if you go away, I shall die.” 

There was in the tone with which he pronounct^l these words a 
melancholy so solemn and so quiet, that Cosette trcml)led. She felt 
that chill whicli is given by a stern and true fact passing over us. 
From the shock she ceased weeping. 

'*Nnw listen,” said he, “do not expect me to-morrow.” 

“Why not?” 

“Do not expect me till the diiy after lo-morrow!” 

“Oh ! wliy not ?” 

“You will see.” 

“A day without seeing yon ! Why, that is im|)o.ssil)]e.” 

“l/‘t us sacrifice one day to gain ]&gt;erhaps a whole life.” 

And Marius added in an nntler tone, and asidt*: 

“Jfe is a man who changes none of liis habits, and he has never 
received auyboily till evenitig.” 

“What man are y»m speaking of r” iiujuireil Co.sette. 

“]\Ie? I saiti nothing.” 

“What is it you hoi&gt;e ftw, 

“Wait till day after tomorrow.” 

“You wislt it ?” 

“Yt‘s, Cosette.” 

She t&lt;»ok his head iu bnth her hands, rising on tiptoe to reach his 
height, and striving tt) s&lt;'e his hope in his eyes, 

Alarius contintjed : 

“it occurs to me, you must know iny atldrt*ss, something may hap- 
pen, we &lt;lon*t: know; 1 live with tlmt friend nanietl t ourfeyrac, Rue 
de la Verrerie, mnnber 16.” 

He [nit his hand in his pockti, took out a penknife, and wrote with 
the blade upon the plastering of the wall; 

16, Rue if e la f VmriV. 

( jisette, meanwhile, began to look inti&gt; Ids eyes again. 

“Tell me your idea. Marins, jsiii have an i&lt;iea, lell me. Oh! tell 
me, so that I may pass a good night 

“My sdc‘a is this ; ,that it is impossifile that GckI should wish to 
sepafeate us. Expect me day after t&lt;i-morrow.” 

“What shall I do till then ?” said Cosette, “You, you are out doors, 
you go, you come! How happy mm are, I have to stay alone. Ohl 



SAINTDENIS 86S 

how sad I shall be ! What is it you are going to do to-morrow eve- 
ning, tell me ?” 

“I shall try a plan.” 

“Then I will pray God, and I will think of you from now till then, 
that you may succeed. I will not ask any more questions, since you 
wish me not to. You are my master. I shall spend my evening to- 
morrow singing that music of Euryanthe which you love, and which 
you came to hear one evening behind my shutter. But day after to- 
morrow you will come early ; I shall expect you at night, at nine 
o’clock precisely. I forewarn you. Oh, dear ! how sad it is that the 
days are long ! You understand ; — when the clock strikes nine, I shall 
be in the garden.” 

“And I too.” ■ _ 

And without saying it, moved by the same thought, drawn on by 
those electric currents which put two lovers in continual communi- 
cation, both intoxicated with pleasure even in their grief, they fell 
into each other’s arms, without perceiving that their lips were joined, 
while their uplifted eyes, overflowing with ecstasy and full of tears, 
were fixed upon the stars. 

When Marius went out, the street was empty. It was the moment 
when Eponine was following the bandits to the boulevard. 

While Marius was thinking with his head against the tree, an idea 
had passed through his mind ; an idea, alas ! which he himself deemed 
senseless and imppssible. He had formed a desperate resolution. 


VII 

THE OLD HEART AND YOUNG HEART IN PRESENCE 

Grandfather Gillenormand had, at this period, fully completed 
his ninety-first year. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand, 
Rue des Filles du Calvaire, No. 6, in that old house which belonged 
to him.. He was, as we remember, one of those antique old men who 
await death still erect, whom age loads without making them stoop, 
and whom grief itself does not bend. 

Still, for some time, his daughter had said : “My father is fail- 
ing.” He no longer beat the servants ; he struck his cane with less 
animation on the landing of the -stairs, when Basque was slow in 
opening the door. The revolution of July had hardly exasperated 
him for six months. He had seen almost tranquilly in the Monitew 
this coupling of words : M. Humblot Conte, peer of France. The fact 
is, that the old man was filled with dejection.. He did not bend, he 
did not yield ; that -was no more a part of his physical than of his 
moral nature; but he’ felt himself interiorly failing. Four years he 
had been waiting for Mariys, with his foot down, that is just the 



866 LES MISERABLES 

word, in the conviction that that naughty little scapegrace would, 
ring at his door some day or other : now he had come, in certain 
gloomy hours, to say to himself that even if Marius should delay, 

but little longer It was not death that was insupportable to him ; 

it was the idea that perhaps he should never see Marius again! 
Never see Marius again, — that had not, even for an instant, entered 
into his thought until this day ; now this idea began to appear to him, 
and it chilled him. Absence, as always happens when feelings are 
natural and true, had only increased his grandfather’s love for the 
ungrateful child who had gone away like that. It is on December 
nights, with the thermometer at zero, that wc_ think most of the 
sun. hi. Gillcnormand was, or thought himself, in any event, incap- 
able of taking a step, he the grandfather, towards his grandson; “I 
would die first,” said he. He acknowledged no fault on his part; but 
he thought of Marius only with a deep tenderness and the mute de- 
spair of an old goodman wlio js going away into the darkness. 

He was beginning to lose his teeth, wliich added to his sadness. 

M. Gillenonnancl, without however acknowledging it to himself, 
for he would have been ftirious and ashame&lt;l at it, had never loved 
a mistress as he knanl Marius. 

He had had hung in his room, at the foot of his bed, as the first 
thing which he wished to see on awaking, an old portrait of his 
other daughter, she who was dead, Madtune Pontmercy, a portrait 
taken when she was eighteen years old. He looked at this portrait 
incessantly. He happened one day to say, while looking at it : 

“I think it looks like the child.” 

“Like my sister?” replied Mademoiselle Gillenormand. “Why 
yes.” 

The old man added : 

“And like him also.” 

Once, as he wa.s sitting, his knees pressed together, and his eyes 
almost closed, in a posture of dejection, his daughter ventured to 
say to him : 

“Father, are you .still .so angry with him?" 

She .stopped, not daring to go further. 

“With whom ?” asked he, 

“With that poor Marius?” 

He raised his old head, laid his thin and wrinkled fist upon the 
table, and cried in his most irritated and quivering tone : 

“Poor Marius, you say? That gentleman is a rascal, a worthless 
knave, a little ungrateful vtutity, with no Iieart, no .soul, a proud, 
a wicked man !" 

And he turned away that his daughter ntight not see the t§ar he 
had in hi.s eyes. 

Three days later, after a silence which had lasted for four hours, 
he said to his daughter snappishly ; 



SAINT DENIS 867; 

“I have had the honour to beg Mademoiselle Gilleiiormand never 
to speak to me of him/' 

Aunt Gillenormand gave up all attempts and came to this pro- 
found diagnosis : father never loved my sister very much 

after her folly. It is clear that he detests Marius." 

‘‘After her folly" meant : after she married the colonel. 

Still, as may have been conjectured, Mademoiselle Gillenormand 
had failed in her attempt to substitute her favourite, the officer of 
lancers, for Marius. The supplanter Theodule had not succeeded. 
Monsieur Gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo. The void 
in the heart does not accommodate itself to a proxy. Theodule, for 
his part, even while snuffing the inheritance, revolted at the drudgery 
of pleasing. The goodman wearied the lancer, and the lancer shocked 
the goodman. Lieutenant Theodule was lively doubtless, but a 
babbler ; frivolous, but vulgar ; a good liver, but of bad company ; 
he had mistresses, it is true, and he talked about them a good deal, 
that is also true ; but he talked about them badly. All his qualities 
had a defect. Monsieur Gillenormand was wearied out with hearing 
him tell of all the favours that he had won in the neighbourhood of 
his barracks, Rue de Babylone. And then Lieutenant Theodule 
sometimes came in his uniform with the tricolour cockade. This 
rendered him altogether insupportable. Grandfather Gillenormand, 
at last, said to his daughter: “I have had enough of him, your 
Theodule. I have little taste for warriors in time of peace. Entertain 
him yourself, if you like. I am not sure, but I like the sabrers even 
better than the trailers of the sabre. The clashing of blades in battle 
is not so wretched, after all, as the rattling of the sheaths on the 
pavement. And then, to harness himself like a bully, and to strap 
himself up like afiirt, to w&lt;iir a corset under a cmrass, is to be ri- 
diculous twice over. A genuine man keeps himself at an equal dis- 
tance from swagger and roguery. Neither hector, nor heartless. 
Keep your Theodule for yourself," 

It was of no use for his daughter to say “Still he is your grand- 
nephew," it turned out that Monsieur Gillenormand, who was 
grandfather to the ends of his nails, was not grand-uncle at all. 

In reality, as he had good judgment and made the comparison, 
Theodule ofily served to increase his regret for Marius, 

One evening, it was the 4th of June, which did not prevent Mon- 
sieur Gillenormand from having a blazing fire in his fireplace, he 
had said goodnight to his daughter who was sewing in the adjoin- 
ing room. He was alone in his room with the rural scenery, his feet 
upon the andirons, half enveloped in his vast coromandel screen 
with nine folds, leaning upon his table on which two candles were 
burning under a green shade, buried in his tapestried armchair, a 
book in his hand, but not reading. He was dressed, according to his 
custom, ew incroyable, and resembled an antique portrait of Garat,

in rapture, affectionate words welled and overflowed in his breast ; 
indeed, all his tenderness started up and came to his lips, and, 
through the contrast which was the groundwork of his nature, there 
came forth a harsh word. He said abruptly : 

‘'What is it you come here for ?” 

Marius answered with embarrassment: 

“Monsieur 

M. Gillenormand would have had Marius throw himself into his 
arms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He felt 
that he was rough, and that Marius was cold. It was to the goodma.n 
an insupportable and irritating anguish, to feel himself so tender 
and so much in tears within, while he could only be harsh without. 
The bitterness returned. He interrupted Marius was a sharp tone : 

“Then what do you come for?'’ 

This then signified: If you don*t come to' embrace me. Marius 
looked at his grandfather, whose pallor had changed to marble 

“Monsieur " 

The old man continued, in a stern voice : 

“Do you come to ask my pardon ? have you seen your fault 

He fliought to put Marius on the track, and that “the child” was 
going to bend. Marius shuddered ; it was the disavowal of his father 
which. was asked of him ; he cast down his eyes and answered : 

“No, monsieur.” 

“And then,” exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief 
which was bitter and full of anger, “what do you want with me?” 

Marius clasped his hands, took a step, and said in a feeble and 
trembling voice : 

“Monsieur, have pity on me.” 

This word moved M. Gillenormand; spoken sooner, it would 
have softened him, but it came too late. The grandfather arose ; he 
supported himself upon his cane with both hands, his lips were white, 
his forehead quivered, but his tall stature commanded the stooping 
Marius. 

“Pity on you, monsieur ! The youth asks pity from the old man of 
ninety-one! You are entering life, I am leaving it; you go to the 
theatre, the ball, the cafe, the billiard-room ; you have wit, you please 
the women, you are a handsome fellow, while I cannot leave my 
chimney corner in midsummer ; you are rich, with the only riches 
there are, while I have all the poverties of old age ; infirmity, isola- 
tion. You have your thirty-two teeth, a gpod stomach, a keen eye, 
strength, appetite, health, cheerfulness, a forest of black hair, while 
I have not even white hair left; I have lost my teeth, I am losing 
my legs, I am losing my memory, there are three names of streets 
which I am always confounding, the Rue Chariot, the* Rue du 
Chaume, and the Rue Saint Claude, there is where I am ; you have 
the whole future before you full of sunshine, while I am beginning

not to see another drop of it, so deep am I getting into the night- 
you are in love, of course, I am not loved by anyljody in the world • 
and you ask pity of me. Zounds, Molicre forgot this. If that is the 
way you jest at the Palais, Messieurs Lawyers, I offer you my sincere 
compliments. You are funny fellows.” 

And the octogenarian resumed in an angry and stern voice; 

“Come now, what do you want of me ?” 

“Monsieur,” said Marius, “I know that my presence is displeasin&lt;r 
to you, but I come only to ask one thing of you, and then I will go 
away immediately.” 

“You are a fool !” said the old man. “Who tells you to go away?” 

This was the translation of tho.se loving words which he had deep 
in his heart : Come, ask my pardon lum! Thrmv yourself on my 
neck! M. Gillenormand felt that Marius w-as going’to leave him in 
a few moments, that his unkind reception repelled him, that his 
harshness was driving him away ; ho said all this to himself, and his 
anguish increased; and as his anguish immediately turned into 
anger, his harshness augmented. 1 le would liave had’ Marius com- 
prehended, and Marius did not coiupreheml ; wdiich rendered the 
goodman furious. lie continued: 

“What! you have left me! me, your grandfather, you have left 
my house to go. nobody knows wliere ; you have afflicted your aunt, 
you have been, that is clear, it is more pleasant, leading the life of a 
bachelor, playing the elegant, gtiing home at all hours, amusing 
yourself ; yeni have not given me a sign (jf life ; you have contracted 
debts without even telling me to pay them ; you have made yourself 
a breaker of windows and a rioter, and. at the end of four years, you 
come to my house, and have nothing to say l)Ut that !” 

This violent method of pushing the grandson to tenderness pro- 
duced only silence on the part of Marius, M, Gillenormand folded 
his arms, a posture yvhich with him was particularly imperious, and 
apostroi)lii.sed Marius bitterly. 

“Let us make an end of it. You have come to ask something of 
me, say you ? Wed what ? what is it ? speak 1" 

‘‘Monsieur,” said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that 
he is aliaut to fall into an ahys.s, “I come to ask your permission to 
mgrry.” 

Gillenormand rang. Basque half tipened the door. 

“Send my daughter in." 

A .second later — the door opened again. Mademoiselle Gillenor- 
mand did not come in, but showed hensel f . Marius was standing, 
mute, his arms hanging down, with the look of a criminal. M. Gille- 
normand was coming and going up and down the room. He turned 
towards hi.s daughter and .said to her : 

“Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Bid him good evening. Mon- 
sieur wishes to marry. That is all. Go.” 



SAINT DENIS 871 

The crisp, harsh tones of the old man’s voice announced a strange 
fulness of feeling. The aunt looked at Marius with a bewildered 
air, appeared hardly to recognise him, allowed neither a motion nor 
a syllable to escape her, and disappeared at a breath from her 
father, quicker than a dry leaf before a hurricane. 

Meanwhile Grandfather Gillenormand had returned and stood 
with his back to the fireplace. 

‘‘You marry ! at twenty-one ! You have arranged that ! You have 
nothing but a permission to ask ! a formality. Sit down, monsieur. 
Well, you have had a revolution since I had the honour to see you. 
The Jacobins have had the upper hand. You ought to be satisfied. 
You are a republican, are you not, since you are a baron? You ar- 
range that. The republic is sauce to the barony. Are you decorated 
by July? — did you take a bit of the Louvre, monsieur? There is 
close by here, in the Rue Saint Antoine, opposite the Rue des Non- 
aindieres, a ball incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house 
with this inscription ; July 28th, 1830. Go and see that. That pro- 
duces a good effect. Ah ! Pretty things those friends of yours do. By 
the way, are they not making a fountain in the square of the monu- 
ment of M. the Duke de Berry ? So you want to marry ? Whom ? can 
the question be asked without indiscretion?” 

He stopped, and, before Marius had had time to answer, he added 
violently : 

“Come now, you have a business ? your fortune made ? how much 
do you earn at your lawyer’s trade?” 

“Nothing,” said Marius, with a firmness and resolution which 
were almost savage. 

“Nothing? you have nothing to live on but the twelve hundred 
.livres which I send you?” 

Marius made no answer. M. Gillenormand continued : 

“Then I understand the girl is rich ?” 

“As I am.” 

“What! no dowry?” 

“No.” 

“Some expectations ?” 

“I believe not.” 

“With nothing to her back ! and what is the father ?” 

‘T do not know.” 

“What is her name ?” 

“Mademoiselle Fauchelevent.” 

“Fauchewhat ?” ' , 

“Fauchelevent.” 

“Pttt 1” said the old man. • 

“Monsieur!” exclaimed Marius. 

M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who 
is talking to himself. 



872 L E S M I S ft R A It L 1C S 

“That is it, twenty-one, no Ijiisiness, twelve linndrcd livres a year 
Madame the Baroness Pontrneicy will go to the market to buy two 
sous’ worth of ptirsley.” 

“Monsieur,” said Marius, iii the desperation of the last vanisliitw 
hope, “I sup])liaite you ! ,1 conjure you, in the name of heaven, with 
clasped hands, monsieur, 1 throw anyself at your feet, allow me to 
marry her!” 

The old man hurst into a shrill, dreary laugh, through which he 
couglicd and spoke. 

“Ha, ha, ha ! you said to yourself, 'The ilevil ! 1 will go and find 
that old wig, that silly dolt ! What a pity that 1 am not twenty-five! 
how I would toss him a gootl respectful notice! how I would give 
him the go-hy. Never mind, I will s;iy to hint : Oh! idiot, you are too 
happy to see me, I desire to n ;irrv. I &lt;!esire to espouse tnainselle

lie your stone to yourself, espoust! your jVitisseleveiit, your Coup- 
k'veiil — .Never, monsieur! never!" 

“I'atiier!" 

“Never !” 

At tlie tone m wliieh this “never" was pronounced Marius lost 
all lio^te. 1 fe waiket! llie room with slow steps, his head Isiwed down, 
tottering, more like a man who is living than like one who is going

sitting near the tables, the light of the candle made the wretched- 
ness of his dress apparent, and the grandfather gazed at it in as- 
tonishment. 

“Well, father,^’ . said Marius 

“Come now,'^ interrupted M. Gillenormand, “then you really 
haven't a sou ? you are dressed like a robber.’" 

He fumbled in a drawer and took out a purse, which he laid upon 
the table : 

“Here, there is a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat.” 

“Father,” pursued Marius, “my good father, if you knew. I love 
her. You don’t realise it ; the first time that I saw her was at the 
Luxembourg, she came there ; in the beginning I did not pay much 
attention to her, and then I do not know how it came about, I fell in 
love with her. Oh ! how wretched it has made me ! Now at last I see 
her every day, at her own house, her father does not know it, only 
think that they are going away, we see each other in the garden in 
the evening, her father wants to take her to England, then I said to 
myself : I will go and see my grandfather and tell him about it. I 
should go crazy in the first place, I should die, I should make myself 
sick, I should throw myself into the river. I must marry her because 
I should go crazy. Now, that is the whole truth, I do not believe that 
I have forgotten anything. She lives in a garden where there is a 
railing, in the Rue Plumet. It is near the Invalides.” 

Grandfather Gillenormand, radiant with joy, had sat down by 
Marius’ side. While listening to him and enjoying the sound of his 
voice, he enjoyed at the same time a long pinch of snuff. At that 
word. Rue Plumet, he checked his inspiration and let the rest of 
his snuff fall on his knees. 

“Rue Plumet ! — ^you say Rue Plumet ? — Let us see now !— Are 
there not some barracks down there? Why yes, that is it. Your 
cousin Theodule has told me about her. The lancer, the officer.^A 
lassie, my good friend, a lassie! — Lord yes, Rue Plumet. That is 
what used to be called Rue Blomet. It comes back to me now, I have 
heard tell about this little girl of the grating in the Rue PlurneL 
In a garden, a Pamela. Your taste is not bad. They say she is nice. 
Between ourselves, I believe that ninny of a, lancer has paid his 
court to her a little, I do not know how far it went. After all that 
does not amount to anything. And then, we must not believe him. 
He is a boaster. Marius ! I think it is very well for a young man like 
you to be in love. It belongs to your age. I like you better in love than 
as a Jacobin. litike you better taken by a petticoat, Lord I by twenty 
petticoats, than by Monsieur de Robespierre. For my part, I do my- 
self this justice that in the matter of sansculottes, I have never liked 
anything but women. Pretty women are pretty women, the devil I 
there is no objection to that. As to the little girl, she receives you

myself. More than one. Do yon kntiw how we do? we don’t take 
the thing ferociously; we don’t rush into tiie tragic; we don’t con- 
clude with marriage and with Mtuisieur the IMayor and his scarf 
We are altogether a slirewd fellow. We have gtjod sense, siip over 
it, mortals, don’t marry. We come and i'uul grandfather who is a 
goodman at heart, and who alinost always has a few rolls of loltis 
in an old drawer; we say to him: ‘tirand father, that’s how it is.’ 
And grandfather says: ‘11iat is all natural. \'oiith must fare and

You understand me ?” 

Marius, ])etriru*d and unahk* ii) articulate a woril, shook his head. 

The goodman burst into a laugh, winkt*d his &lt;dd eye, gave him a 
tap on tile knee, looked straight iut&lt;» his vyv^i with a significant and 
sparkling expressioti, and said Ut him with the mt)st amorous shrug 
of the shoulders: 

^*Stupid! make Iter your ini’^tress/* 

Marius turned ixde. He had nndersto&lt;H! nothing of all that his 
grandfatluT had been sa\ing. litis rigmarole of Ktie lllomct, of 
“I’arnela, of harraHcs, of a laiiciU'. had passtsl heftire Marius like a 
jihantasmagoria, Xothing of all eouhl relate to t 'osette, who was a 
lily. The goodman was wauderinfg Hut this wandering had ter- 
minated in a word which Marius did understand, and which was a 
deadly insult io t osette. Tliat phrase, muliC hvr ymir mistms, en- 
tered the. heart of tlie chaste young man like a swi&gt;rd. 

He nme, incked up liis hat which was on the Ikior, and walked 
towards tln^ door witli a firm ami assured step. Hjere lie turned, 
liowcd iirofmmdly before his grandfather, raised his head again, 
and .said : 

years ago yott outraged my father; to-day you have out- 
rageti my wife. I a&gt;k mubing more oi you, monsieur. Adieu,” 

Gramifuiher (iillenurinaud, astounded, opeiunl his mouth, 
stretched out his arms, attempted to rise, tnu liefore he could utter 
a word, the door closci! and Marius hufl disappt‘ared. 

The ok! man was for a few moments motionless, and as it were 
thunder-stneken, unable to sf^eak or hrt^athe, as if a hand were 
clutching liis throat. At last lie ittre himself from his chair, ran to the 
door ns fast as a man who is ninety-one can run, opened it and cried: 

^*ljelp!help!” 

His daughter appeared, then the servants. He continued with a 
pitiful rattle in his voice; 

**Rtin after him ! catch Irim ! what have 1 done to him ! he i.s mad! 
he is going away! Oh! my tkHl! oh! my tkid!— this time he will 
not come back !” 



SAINTDENIS 875 

He went to the window which looked upon the street, opened it 
with his tremulous old hands, hung more than half his body outside, 
while Basque and Nicolette held him from behind, and cried : 

“Marius ! Marius ! Marius ! Marius 

But Marius was already out of hearing, and was at that very 
moment turning the corner of the Rue Saint Louis. 

The octogenarian carried his hands to his temples two or three 
times, with an expression of anguish, drew back tottering, and sank 
into an armchair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless, shaking his head, 
and moving his lips with a stupid air, having now nothing in his eyes 
or in his heart but something deep and mournful, which resembled 
night.

de M.ars, revolving all wanner «&gt;f ihonghis in his nnnd. Thwmrdier, 
the police, the journey, and the ilifTicnliv of pnK-nring a uassoort. 
On alt these jxdnts he was atmiotts. 

Pinallv, an inexpliealdc circninstance which had just hiirst upon 
him, and with which he was still warm, had ndiled to his alann. On 
the morning of that very day, lieiiig the only one up in the house, 
and walking in the garden before C'tiseite's shutters were open, he 
had^suddenly come H|xin this line scratched ujion the wall, probably

It was quite recent, the lines were while in the old bladt mortar, 
a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall wa.s powdered with fmh Sae

plaster. It had probably been written during the night. What was it ? 
an address? a signal for others? a warning for him? At all events, 
it was evident that the garden had been violated, and that some 
persons unknown had penetrated into it. He recalled the strange in- 
cidents which had already alarmed the house. His mind worked 
upon this canvass. He took good care not to speak to Cosette of the 
line written on the wall, for fear of frightening her. 

In the midst of these meditations, he perceived, by a shadow which 
the sun had projected, that somebody had just stopped upon the 
crest of the embankment immediately behind him. He was about to 
turn round, when a folded paper fell upon his knees, as if a hand 
had dropped it from above his head. He took the paper, unfolded it, 
and read on it this word, written in large letters with a pencil : 

Remove. 

Jean Valjean rose hastily, there wa^‘ no longer anybody on the 
embankment ; he looked about him, and perceived a species of being 
larger than a child, smaller than a man, dressed in a grey blouse, 
and trousers of dirt-coloured cotton velvet, which jumped over the 
parapet and let itself slide into the ditch of the Champ de Mars, 

Jean Valjean returned home immediately, full of thought. 


II 

MARIUS 

Marius had left M. Gillenormand’s desolate. He had entered with 
a very small hope ; he came out with an immense despair. 

Still, and those who have observed the beginnings of the human 
heart will understand it, the lancer, the officer, the ninny, the' cousin 
Theodule, had left no shadow in his mind. Not the slightest. The 
dramatic poet might apparently hope for some complications from 
this revelation, made in the very teeth of the grandson by the grand- 
‘ father. But what the drama would gain, the truth would lose. Marius 
was at that age when we believe no ill ; later comes the age when he 
believes all: Suspicions are nothing more nor less than wrinkles. 
Early youth has none. What overwhelms Othello, glides over Can- 
dida. Suspect Cosette ! There are a multitude of crimes which 
Marius could have more easily committed. 

He began to walk the streets, the resource of those who suffer. 
He thought of nothing which he could ever remember. At two 
o'clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac's, and threw him- 
self,. dressed as he was, upon his mattress. It was broad sunlight 
when he fell asleep, with that frightful, heavy slumber in which the 
ideas come and go in the brain. When he awoke, he saw standing 
in the room, their hats upon their heads, all ready to go out, and 
very busy, Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre, 



878 L E S M I S E R A B L E S 

Coiirfeyrac said to him : 

‘‘Are you going to the funeral of General Lamarque?'' 

It seemed to him that Coiirfeyrac was speaking Chinese. 

He went out some time after them. He put into his pocket the 
pistols which Javert had confided to him at the time of the adventure 
of the 3rd of February, and which had remained in his hands. These 
pistols were still loaded. It would ht difficult to say what obscure 
thought he had in his mind in taking tliem with him. 

He rambled about all day without knowing where ; it rained at 
intervals, he did not perceive it ; for Iiis dinner he bought a penny 
roll at a baker's, put it in his pocket, and forgot it. It would appear 
that he took a bath in the Seine without being conscious of it. There 
are moments when a man has a furnace in his l)rain. Marius was in 
one of those moments. He hoped nothing more, he feared nothing 
more ; he had reached this condition since the evening before. He 
waited for night with feverish im|)atitaice, he had but one clear 
idea; that was, that at nine o'clock he should see Cosette. This last 
hapinness was now his whole future; aflcrwanls, darkness. At in- 
tervals, while walking along the most deserted boulevards, he 
seemed to hear strange souinls iii I\aris, lie roused himself from 
his reverie, and said: “Are tliey ilgliting?” 

At nightfall, at precisely jiine o’clock, as he had promised Cosette, 
he was in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he for- 
got everything else. It was ftn-iy-eight liours since he had seen 
Cosette, he was going to see her again, evtn-y other thought faded 
^away, and he felt now only a deep and wonderful joy. Those minutes 
^in which we live centuries alwaj^s have lliis sovereign and wonder- 
ful peculiarity, that for the moment wliile they are passing, they 
entirely fill the heart, 

Marius displaced the grating, and sprang into the garden. Cosette 
was not at the place where slic usually waited for him. He crossed 
the thicket and went to the recess near the steps, “She is waiting for 
me there/' said he, Cosette was not th&lt;?re. He raised Ins eyes, and saw 
the shutters of the house were closed, lie took a turn around the 
garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the house, 
and, mad with love, intoxicated, dismayed, exasperated with grief 
and anxiety, like a master wlio returns home in an untoward h^our, 
he rapped on the shutters. He rapj)e&lt;l, he rapj)ed again, at the risk 
of seeing the window 0 {)en and the forbidding face of the father 
appear and ask him : ^‘What &lt;lo yon want ?“ I'his was nothing com- 
pared with what he now began to see. When he had rapped, he 
raised his voice and called Cosette. “Cosette!*^ cried he. “Cosette!'* 
repeated he imperiously. There was no answer. It was settled. No- 
body in the garden ; nobody in the house. 

Marins fixed his despairing eyes ui)on that dismal house, as black, 
as silent, and more empty than a tomb. He looked at the stone scat 



SAINT DENIS 879 

where he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then he 
sat down upon the steps, his heart full of tenderness and resolution, 
he blessed his love in the depths of his thought, and he said to him- 
self that since Cosette was gone, there was nothing more for him 
but to die. 

Suddenly he heard a voice which appeared to come from the 
street, and which cried through the trees : 

“Monsieur Marius !” 

He arose. 

“Hey?” said he. 

^‘Monsieur Marius, is it you ?” 

“Yes.”_ 

“Monsieur Marius,” added the voice, “your friends are expecting 
you at the barricade, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie.” 

This voice was not entirely unknown to him. It resembled the 
harsh and roughened voice of Eponine. Marius ran to the grating, 
pushed aside the movable bar, passed his head through, and saw 
somebody who appeared to him to be a young man rapidly disappear- 
ing in the twilight. ■ 


III 

M. MABEUF 

Jean Valjean's purse was useless, to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his 
venerable childlike austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars ; 
he did not admit that a star could coin itself into gold louis. He did 
not guess that what fell from the sky came from Gavroche. He 
carried the purse to the Commissary of Police of the quartier, as a 
lost article, placed by the finder at the disposition of claimants. The 
purse was lost, in fact. We need not say that nobody reclaimed it, 
and it did not help M. Mabeuf. 

For the rest, M. Mabeuf had continued to descend. 

The experiments upon indigo had succeeded no better at the Jar- 
din des Plantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before, he 
owed his housekeeper her wages ; now, we have seen, he owed three 
quarters of his rent. The pawnbroker, at the expiration of thirteen 
months, had sold the plates of his Flora. Some coppersmith had 
made saucepans of them. His plates gone, being no longer able even 
to complete the broken sets of his Flora which he still possessed, 
he had given up engravings and text at a wretched price to a second- 
hand bookseller, as odd copies. He had now nothing left of the work 
of his whole life. He began to eat up the money from these copies. 
When he saw that this slender resource was failing him, he re- 
nounced his garden and left it uncultivated. Before this, and for a 
long time before, he had given up the two eggs and the bit of beef 



880 L E S M I S E R A B L K S ^ 

which he used to eat from time to time. He dined on bread and 
potatoes. He had sold his last furniture, then all hi.s spare bedding 
and clothing, then his collections of plants and his pictures ; but 1^ 
still had his most precious books, several of which were of great 
rarity, among other Les Quadrhis Hisloriqucs de la Bible, edition 
of 1^60, La Concordance dcs Bibles of Pierre dc P.esse, Les Mar- 
guerites dc la Marguerite of Jean de la 11 aye with a dedication to the 
Queen of Navarre, the Itook On the charge and^ dignity of the Am- 
bassador by the Sieur de Villiep J Intrnan, a I'lorilegiiwi Rabbini- 
cum of 1644. a Tibullus of _1.S67 with this splendid inscription: 
Venctiis, in cedihus Maniilianis; finally a Diogenes Laertius, printed 
at Lyons in 1644, eonlaining the famous variations of the manu- 
script 411, of the thirteenth century, in the Vatican, and those of 
the two manuscripts of \'enice, and 3‘H, so frtut fully consulted 
by Henry Estieiine, and .ill the passages in the Doric dialect which 
are found only in tlie celeliratetl mamiscript of the twelfth century 
of the library of Nai.iles. _M. Mahenf never made a fire in his room, 
and went to bed by d.aylight .so as not to burn a candle. It seemed 
that he had now no neighliyurs, he was shjinned when he went out; 
he w:ls aware of it. 'I'he nii.sery of a child is interesting to a mother, 
the misery of a young jnan is juteresting to a 3 'oung winnan, the 
misery of an old m;in is inlerestiiig to mibo&lt;ly. 'Fliis is of ;ill miseries 
the coldest. .Still I'alher ■Mabeuf Imd not entirely lost his childlike 
.serenity. His eye regaiiual some viv.acity when it w:is fi.xed upon 
his books, and he smiled when he thoughi tif the. Diogenes l-aertius, 
"which w:is a uniiiue copy. His glass bookcase was the only piece of 
furnittire which he had preserved beyond what was indispens.ible. 

One day Mother Plutarch said to him ; 

“f have nothing to buy the dinner with." 

What .she calkal the dinner was u loaf of bread and four or five 
potatoes. 

“On credit ?" said M. .Mabeuf. 

“You know well enough tliat they refu.se tne.’’ 

M. Mabeuf openefi his libniry, looked long at all his hooks one 
after another, as a fatlier, compelled to deeimale his ehildrcn, would 
look at them liefore choosing, then look one of them hastily, put it 
under his arm, and went out. lie retunasl two hours afterwards 
with nothing under his !irm, laid lliirly sous on the tjihle, .and said: 

“You will get some dinner." 

Prom that nionnmt, Mother Plutarch saw settling over the old 
man’s while face a tlark veil wliieli was never lifted again. 

The next day, the day after, every d;iy, he luwl to liegJn again. M. 

• Mabeuf went ont with si book and eame'back with a piece of money. 
As the bookstall keei»ers saw that he was forced to sell, they Itought 
from hint fur twenty sous w!i.at he ha»l {taid twenty francs for, 
sttmetimes ♦&lt;&gt; *he same ' ccksellers. Volume by volume, the whole 



SAINTDENIS 881 

library passed away. He said at times : '‘I am eighty years old how- 
ever/’ as if he had some lingering hope of reaching the end of his 
days before reaching the end of his books. His sadness increased. 
Once, however, he had a pleasure. He went out with a Robert Es- 
tienne which he sold for thirty-five sous on the Quai Malaquais 
and returned with an Aldine which he had bought for forty sous 
in the Rue des Gres. '‘I owe five sous,” said he to Mother Plutarch, 
glowing with joy. 

That day he did not dine. 

He belonged to the Society of Horticulture. His poverty was 
known there. The president of this society came to see him, promised 
to speak to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, 
and did so. '‘Why, how now 1” exclaimed the minister. 'T do be- 
lieve ! An old philosopher ! a botanist ! an inoffensive man ! We must 
do something for him !” The next day M. Mabeuf received an in- 
vitation to dine at the minister’s. Trembling with joy, he showed 
the letter to Mother Plutarch. "We are saved !” said he. On the 
appointed day, he went to the minister’s. He .perceived that his 
ragged cravat, his large, old, square coat, and his shoes polished 
with egg, astonished the ushers. Nobody spoke to him, not even the 
minister. About ten o’clock in the evening, as he was still expecting 
a word, he heard the minister’s wife, a beautiful lady in a low- 
necked dress, whom he had not dared to approach, asking : "What 
CiXn that old gentleman be ?” Pie returned home on foot, at midnight, 
in a driving rain. lie had sold an Elzevir to pay for a fiacre to go with. 

He had acquired the habit, every evening before going to bed, of 
reading a few pages in his Diogenes Laertius. He knew Greek well 
enough to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he possessed. He 
had now no other joy. Some weeks rolled by. Suddenly Mother 
Plutarch fell sick. There is one thing sadder than having nothing 
with which to buy bread from the baker ; that is, having nothing 
with which to buy drugs from the apothecary. One night, the doctor 
had ordered a very dear potion. And then, the sickness was growing 
worse, a nurse was needed- M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase ; thei'e 
was nothing more there. The last volume had gone. The Diogenes 
Laertius alone remained. 

Pie put the unique copy under his arm and went out ; it was the 
4th of June, 1832; he went to the Porte Saint Jacques, to Royol’s 
Successor’s, and returned with a hundred francs. He laid the pile 
of five-franc pieces on the old servant’s bedroom table, and went 
back to his room without saying a word. 

The next day, by dawn, he was seated on the stone post in the 
garden, and he might have been seen from over the hedge all the 
morning motionless, his head bowed down, his eye vaguely fixed 
upon the withered beds. At intervals he wept ; the old man did not 
seem to perceive it. In the afternoon, extraordinary sounds broke

BOOK TENTH— JUNE 5th, 1832

THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTION 

Of what is the emeute composed ? of nothing and of ever3d:hmg. Of 
an electricity gradually evolved, of a flame suddenly leaping forth, 
of a wandering force, of a passing wind. This wind meets talking 
tongues, dreaming brains, suffering souls, burning passions, howl- 
ing miseries, and sweeps them away. 

Whither ? 

At hazard. Across the state, across the laws, across the prosperity 
and the insolence of others. 

Irritated convictions, eager enthusiasms, excited indignations, 
the repressed instincts of war, exalted young courage, noble im- 
pulses ; curiosity, the taste for change, the thirst for the unexpected, 
that sentiment which gives us pleasure in reading the bill of a new 
play, and which makes the ringing of the prompter’s bell at the 
theatre a welcome sound ; vague hatreds, spites, disappointments, 
every vanity which believes that destiny has caused it to fail ; dis- 
comforts, empty dreams, ambitions shut in by high walls, whoever 
hopes for an issue from a downfall; finally, at the very bottom, the 
mob, that mud which takes fire, such are the elements of the emeute. 

Whatever is greatest and whatever is most infamous ; the beings 
who prowl about outside of everything, awaiting an opportunity, 
bohemians, people without occupation, loafers abotit the street-^ 
corners, those who sleep at night in a desert of houses, with no other 
roof than the cold clouds of the sky, those who ask their bread each 
day from chance and not from labour, the unknown ones of misery 
and nothingness, the bare arms, the bare feet, belong to the emeute. 

Whoever feels in his soul a secret revolt against any act what- 
ever of the state, of life or of fate, borders on the emeute, arid, so 
soon as it appears, begins to shiver, and to feel himself uplifted by 
the whirlwind. 

The emeute is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which 
suddenly takes form in certain conditions of temperature, and 
which, in its whirling, mounts, runs, thunders, tears up, razes, 
crushes, demolishes, uproots, dragging with it the grand natures and 
the paltry, the strong man and the feeble mind, the trunk of the tree 
and the blade of straw.

884 L E S M I S E 1&lt; A B E E s 

Woe to him whom it sweeps away, as well as to him whom it 
comes to smite ! It breaks them one aj'ainst the other. 

It communicates to those whom it seizes a mysterious and extra- 
ordinary power. It fills the first comer with the force of events - it 
makes projectiles of everything. It makes a bullet of a pebble and 
a general of a street porter. 

If we may believe certain oracles (jf crafty politics, from the 
governmental point of view, something of the emeutc is desirable 
System: the emeute strengthens those governments which it does 
not overthrow. It tests the army, it concentrates the bourgeoisie - it 
calls out the muscles of the ]_)olice_; it determines the strength of the 
social frame. It is a gymnastic training ; it is almost hygienic. Power 
is healthier after an emeute, as ;i man is after a rubbing. 

The emeute, thirty years ago, was looked upon from still other 
points of view. 

There is a tlienry for everything- which proclaims itself “common 
sense;” riiilintc against AlcesK-; meditation offered between the 
true and the false; explanation, admonition, a somewhat hau&lt;&gt;-hty 
extenuation which, because it is a mixture of blame and e.xcuse 
thinks itself wi.sdom, and is often only jH-dantrv. An entire political 
.school, called the compromise .school, h:is sjirung from this. Be- 
tween cold Wilier and warm water, this is the party of tepid -water. 
This .school, with its prctendi-d depth, wholly supurlicial, which dis- 
sects effect witliout going h,-tck to the causes, from the height of a 
lial f-.science, eludes the .-igitations of the pulilic .square. 

To hoar this school : “The emeuti-s with which the achievement 
of 1830 was complic.ateil, rohhed Ilmt great event of a portion of 
its purity. T'lie revolution of July h.-ul been a fine breeze of the 
popular wind, quickly followed hy blue sky. 'ITiey brought back 
the cloudy .sky. They degraded tluit n-voluiinn, at lirst so 'remark- 
able for unanimity, into a f[ttai-rel. fn the revohifion of July, as in all 
sudden progress, there were some secret fractures ; the emeute 
rendered them sensible. We might say; ‘.\h! this is broken.’ After 
the revolution of July, the ilelivenuice only was felt; after the 
cmeute.s, the catastnqdie was fell. 

“Kvery emeute clo.ses llie sliojis, d(-presses the funds, terrifies 
the .stockhoard, suspends enmnu-n-e, shackles Itusiness, precipitates 
failures ; no more money, private fortunes shaken, the public credit 
di.slurhed, inanufaetures disconcerted, ctipii.-d hoarded, labour 
depreciated, fear everywhere; reaetion.s in all the cities. Hence 
yawning gulfs. It has been caleulafed that the first day of an emeute 
costs France twenty millions, the second forty, tlie third sixty. An 
tuneute of three days eo,sts .n htindred and twe.iity tnillitins, that is to 
.say, looking otily at the financial result, is t'(|uivalent to a disa.ster, 
a shipwreck, or the loss of a battle, which should annihilate a fleet of 
sixty vessels of tlie line. 



SAINTDENIS 885 

‘'Beyond a doubt, historically, emeutes had their beauty ; the war 
of the pavements is no less grand and no less pathetic than the war 
of the thickets ; in the one there is the soul of forests ; in the other 
the heart of cities ; one has Jean Chouan, the other has Jeanne. The 
emeutes illuminated, with red light, but splendidly, all the most 
original outgrowths of the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, 
stormy gaiety, students proving that bravery is part of intelligence, 
the National Guard unwavering, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses 
of gamins, scorn of death among the people on the street. Schools 
and legions came in conflict. After all, between the combatants, 
there was only a difference of age; they were the same race; they 
are the same stoical men who die at twenty for their ideas, at forty 
for their families. The army, always sad in civil wars, opposed pru- 
dence to audacity. The emeutes, at the same time tha.t they mani- 
fested the intrepidity of the people, effected the education of the 
courage of the bourgeois. 

“Very well. But is it all worth the bloodshed? And to the blood- 
shed add the future darkened, progress incriminated, anxiety among 
the best men, noble liberals despairing, foreign absolutism delighted 
with these wounds inflicted on the revolution by itself, the vanquished 
of 1830 triumphing and saying : ‘We told you so Add Paris en- 
larged perhaps, but France surely diminished. Add, for we must tell 
all, the massacres which too often dishonoured the victory of order 
grown ferocious over liberty grown mad. Taken altogether, emeutes 
have been disastrous. 

Thus speaks this almost wisdom with which the bourgeoisie, that 
almost people, so gladly contents itself. 

As for us, we reject this too broad and consequently too con- 
venient word, emeute. Between a popular movement and a popular 
movement, we make a distinction. We do not ask whether an emeute 
cost as much as a battle. In the first place wherefore a battle? Here 
arises the question of war. Is war less a scourge than the emeute a 
calamity ? And then, are all emeutes calamities ? And what if Jhe 
14th of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions ? The establish- 
ment of Philip V. in Spain cost France two thousand millions. 
Even at the same price, we should prefer the 14th of July. Moreover, 
we put aside these figui^es, which seem to be reasons, and which are 
only words. An Emeute given, we examine it in itself. In all that 
is said by the theoretic objection above set forth, only the effect is 
in question, we seek for the cause. 

We specify.

THE BOTTOM OF THE QUESTION 

There is the emeute, there is the insurrection ; they are two angers r 



886 L E S M I S E K A » L E S 

one is wrong, the other is riglit. In tlemocratic stales, the only gov- 
ernments founded in justice, it sonieliines hapiiens that a fra^on 
usurps; then the whole rises up, and the necessary vindication of its 
right may go so far as to take up anus, i n all (juestions which spring 
from the collective sovereignly, the. war of the whole against the 
fraction is insurrection ; the attack of the frriction against 'the whole 
is an emeuto; according as the 'I'nileries contain the King or con- 
tain the Qmvention, thev are jnsfly or unjustly attacked. The same 
cannon pointed against the iiuiltitude is wrong the 10th of August 
and right the 14tli of \-'ejuleniiain'. Similar in appearance, different

lisation; the instinct (if the ina.sses, yi'sterday clear-sighted, may to-

storehouses, the tearing' up of mils, the demolition &lt;if dock.s, the false 
means of the multitudes, the tleiiials of justice liy the people to 
progress, Ramus assassinated hy the students. Rousseau driven out’ 
of Switzerland wit h_ stones, is the enieiite, Israel against Moses

is an act of violence against the human race. Insurrection is the 
Truth's access of fury; the paving stones which insurrection tears 
up, throw off the spark of right. These stones leave to the emeute 
only their mud. Danton against Louis XVI. is insurrection, Hebert 
against Danton is emeute. 

Hence it is that, if insurrection, in given cases, may be, as Lafay- 
ette said, the most sacred of duties, an emeute may be the most 
deadly of crimes. 

There is also some difference in the intensity of caloric ; the in- 
surrection is often a volcano, the emeute is often a fire of straw. 

The revolt, as we have said, is sometimes on the part of power. 
Polignac is an emeuter ; Camille Desmoulins is a governor. 

Sometimes, insurrection is resurrection. . 

« The solution of everything by universal suffrage being a fact 
entirely modeim, and all history anterior to that fact being, for four 
thousand years, filled with violated right- and the suffering of the 
people, each period of history brings with it such protest as is pos- 
sible to it. Under the Caesars there was no insurrection, but there 
was Juvenal. 

The fadt indignatio replaces the Gracchi. 

Under the Ca2sai“s there is the exile of Syene; there is also the 
man of the Annalcs, 

We do not speak of the sublime exile of Patmos, who also over- 
whelms the real woidd with a protest in the name of the ideal, makesr 
of a vision a tremendous satire, and throws upon Nineveh-Rome, 
upon Babylon-Rome, upon Sodom-Rome, the flaming reverbera- 
tion of the Apocalypse. 

John upon his rock is the Sphinx upon her pedestal; we cannot 
comprehend him ; he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew.; but the man who 
wrote the Annates is a Latin ; let us rather say he is a Roman. 

As the Neros reign darkly, they should be pictured so. Work 
with the graver only would be pale ; into the grooves should be 
poured a concentrated prose which bites. . 

Despots are an aid to thinkers. Speech enchained is speech tei'- 
tible. The writer doubles and triples his style when silence is im- 
posed by a master upon the people. There springs from this silence 
a certain mysterious fulness which filters and freezes into brass 
in the thoughts. Compression in the history produces conciseness 
in the historian. The granitic solidity of some celebrated prose is only 
a condensation produced by the tyrant. Tyranny constrains the 
writer to shortenings of diameter which are increases of strength. 
The Ciceronian period, hardly sufficient upon Verres, would lose 
its edge upon Caligula. Less roundness in the phrase, more intensity 
in the blow. Tacitus thinks with his arm drawn back.

it struck at hazard ; it marched like the blind elephant, crushing ; it 
left behind it the corpses of old men, women, and children ; it poured 
out, without knowing why, the blood of the inoffensive and the in- 
nocent. To nurture the people is a good end ; to massacre it is an evil 
means. 

Every armed protest, even the most legitimate, even the 10th of 
August, even the 14th of July, ends with the same trouble. Before 
the right is evolved, tliei'e is tumult and foam. In the beginning in- 
surrection is an emeute, even as the river is a torrent. Ordinarily it 
ends in this ocean, revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from 
those high mountains which rule the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, 
reason, right, made of the purest snow of the ideal, after a long fall 
from rock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency 
and been swollen by a hundred affluents in the majestic path of tri- 
umph, insurrection suddenly loses itself in some bourgeois quag- 
mire, like the Rhine in a marsh. 

All this is of the past, the future is different. Universal suffrage 
is so far admirable that it dissolves the emeute in its principle, and 
by giving a vote to insurrection, it takes away its arms. The vanish- 
ing of war, of the war of the streets as well as the war of the fron- 
tiers, such is inevitable progress. Whatever may be To-day, peace is 
To-morrow. 

However, insurrection, emeute, in what the first differs from the 
second, the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows little of these 
shades. To him, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, revolt of 
the dog against the master, attempt to bite which must be punished 
by chain and kennel, barking, yelping, till the day when the dog’s 
head, suddenly enlarged, stands out dimly in the darkness with a 
lion’s face. 

Then the bourgeois cries : Vive le peiiple ! 

This explanation given, what, for history, is the movement of 
June, 1832 ? is it an emeute ? is it an insurrection ? 

It is an Insurrection. 

We may happen, in this presentation of a fearful event, some- 
times to vSay the emeute, but only to denote the surface facts, and 
always maintaining the distinction between the form emeute and 
the substance insurrection. 

This movement of 1832 had, in its rapid explosion and in its dis- 
mal extinction, so much' grandeur that those even who see in it nnly 
an, emeute do not speak of it without respect. To them it is like a 
remnant of 1830. ^‘Excited imaginations,” say they, “do not calm 
down in a day. A revolution is not cut off square. It has always some 
necessary undulations before returning to the condition of peace 
like a mountain on descending towards the plain. There are no Alps 
without their Jura, nor Pyrenees without Asturias. 

This pathetic crisis of contemporary history, which the memory

period amid the stormy periods of this century. A last word before

which pleased the multitude ; and for seventeen years, hardly notic- 
ing intermediate events, he had majestically preserved the sadness 
of Waterloo. In his death-agony, at his latest hour, he had pressed 
against his breast a sword which was preseuUted to him by the of- 
ficers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon died pronouncing the word 
armee, Lamarque pronouncing the word patrie. 

His death, which had been looked for, was dreaded by the people 
as a loss, and by the government as an opportunity. This death was 
a mourning. Like everything which is bitter, mourning may turn 
into revolt. This is what happened. 

The eve and the morning of the Sth of June, the day fixed for the 
funeral of Lamarque, the Faubourg Saint Antoine, through the 
edge of which the procession was to pass, assumed a formidable 
aspect. That tumultuous network of streets was full of rumour. 
Men armed themselves as they could. Some joiners carried their 
bench-claw '‘to stave in the doors,” One of them had made a dagger 
of a shoe-hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump. 
Another, in the fever "to attack,” had slept for three nights with- 
out undressing. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, who 
asked him : "Where are you going ?” "Well ! I have no arms.” "What 
then ?” "I am going to my yard to look for my compasses.” "What 
for?” "I don’t know,” said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, a man of 
business, hailed every working-man who passed by with: "Come, 
you !” He bought ten sous’ worth of wine, and said : "Have you any 
work?” "No.” "Go to Filspierre’s, between the Barriere Montreuil 
and the Barriere Charonne, you will find work.” They found at Fils- 
piefre’s cartridges and arms. Certain known chiefs did the post; 
that is to say, ran from one house to another to assemble their peo- 
ple. At Barthelemy’s, near the Barriere du Trone, and at Capet’s, at 
the Petit Chapeau, the. drinkers accosted each other seriously. They 
were heard to say: ** Where is your pistol ‘^Vnder my blouse/^ 
''And yours r' "Under my shirt/' On the Rue Traversiere, in front 
of the Roland workshop, and in the Com* de la Maison Bmlee, in 
front of Bernier’s machine-shop, groups were whispering. Among 
the most ardent, a certain Mavot was noticed, who never worked 
more than a week in one shop, the masters sending him away, "be- 
cause they had to dispute with him every day.” Mavot was killed the 
next clay in the barricade, in the Rue Menilmontant. Pretot, who 
was also to die in the conflict, seconded Mavot, and to this question : 
"What is your object?” answered: ‘insurrection/' Some working- 
men, gathered at the corner of the Rue de Bercy, were waiting for a 
man named Lemarin, revolutionary officer for the Faubourg Saint 
Marceau. Orders were passed about almost publicly. 

On the Sth of June, then, a day Of mingled rain and sunshine, the 
procession of General Lamarque passed through Paris with the 
official military pomp, somewhat increased by way of precaution.

The cortege made its way, with a feverish slowness, from the- 
house of death, along the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained 
from time to time ; the rain had no effect upon that throng. Several 
incidents, the coffin drawn around the Vendome column, the stones- 
thrown at the Duke de Fitz-James who was seen on a balcony with 
his hat on, the Gallic cock torn, from a popular flag and dragged in 
the mud, a sergent de ville wounded by a sword thrust at the Porte 
Saint Martin, an officer of the 12th Light saying aloud : 'T am a re- 
' publican,'* the Polytechnic School unlooked for after its forced 
countersign, the cries : Vive Vecole polytechnique! Vive la repub- 
lique! marked the progress of the procession. At the Bastille, long 
and formidable files of the curious from the Faubourg Saint An- 
toine made their junction with the cortege, and a certain terrible 
ebullition began to upheave the multitude. 

One man was heard saying to another : “Do you see that man 
with the red beard ? it is he who will say when we must draw." It 
would appear that the same red beard was found afterwards with 
the same office in another emente ; the Quenisset affair. 

The hearse passed the Bastille, followed the canal, crossed the 
little bridge, and reached the esplanade of the Bridge of Auster- 
litz. There it stopped. At this moment a bird's-eye view of this multi- 
tude would have presented the appearance of a comet, the head of 
which was at the esplanade, while the tail, spreading over the Qua! 
Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and stretched along the boulevard as. 
far as the Porte Saint Martin. A circle was formed about the hearse. 
The vast assemblage became silent, Lafayette spoke and bade fare- 
well to Lamarque. It was a touching and august moment, all heads- 
were uncovered, all hearts throbbed. Suddenly a man on horseback,, 
dressed in black, appeared in the midst of the throng with a red flag,, 
others say with a pike surmounted by a i^ed cap. Lafayette turned 
away his head. Exelmans left the coi'tege. 

This red flag raised a storm and disappeared in it. From the 
Boulevard Bourbon to the Bridge of Austerlitz one of those shouts- 
which resemble billows moved the multitude. Two prodigious shouts- 
arose ; Lamarque to the Pantheon! Lafayette to the Hotel de Ville! 
Some young men, amid the cheei'S of the throng, harnessed them- 
selves, and began to draw Lamarque in the hearse over the bridge 
of Austerlitz, and Lafayette in a fiacre along the Quai Morland. 

In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, was no- 
ticed and pointed out a German, named Ludwig Snyder, who after 
wards died a centenarian, who had also been in the war of 1776^ 
and who had fought at Trenton under Washington, and under 
Lafayette at Brandywine. 

Meanwhile, on the left bank, the municipal cavalry was in mo- 
tion, and had just barred the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons 
left the Celestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men

frightful gaiety. At first there are clamours, the shops close, the dis- 
plays of the merchants disappear; then some isolated shots; people 
flee; butts of guns strike against porte-cocheres ; you hear the serv- 
ant girls laughing in the yards of the houses and saying: There is 
going to he a row! 

A quarter of an hour had not elapsed and here is what had taken 
place nearly at the same time at twenty different points in Paris. 

In the Rue Sainte Croix de la Bretonnerie, some twenty young 
men, with beards and long hair, entered a smoking-room and came 
out again a moment afterwards, bearing a horizontal tricolour flag 
covered with crape, and having at their head' three men armed, one 
with a sword, another with a gun, the third with a pike. 

In the Rue des Nonaindieres, a well-dressed bourgeois, who was 
pursy, had a sonorous voice, a bald head, a high forehead, a black 
beard, and one of those rough moustaches which cannot be smoothed 
down, offered cartridges publicly to the passers-by. 

In the Rue Saint Pierre- Montmartre, some men with bare arms 
paraded a black flag on which these words could be read in white 
letters: Reptiblic or death,' In the Rue des Jeuneurs, the Rue du 
Cadran, the Rue Montorgueil, and the Rue Mandar, appeared 
groups waving flags on which were visible in letters of gold, the 
word section with a number. One of these flags was red and blue 
with an imperceptible white stripe between. 

A manufactory of arms was rifled, on the Boulevard Saint Mar- 
tin, and three armourer’s shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the 
second in the Rue Michel le Comte, the third in the Rue du Temple. 
In a few minutes the thousand hands of the multitude seized and 
carried off two hundred and thirty musjeets nearly all double-bar-' 
relied, sixty-four swords, eighty-three pistols. To arm more people, 
one took the gun, another the bayonet. 

Opposite the Quai de la Greve, young men armed with muskets 
installed themselves with the women to shoot. One of them had a 
musket with a match-lock. They rang, entered, and set to making 
cartridges. One of these women said: did not know what car- 

tridges were, my husband told me toT 

A throng broke into a curiosity shop in the Rue des Vieilles Hand, 
riettes and took some yataghans and Turkish arms. 

The corpse of a mason killed by a musket shot was lying in the 
Rue de la Perle. 

And then, right bank, left bank, on the quais, on the boulevards, 
in the Latin quartier, in the region of the markets, breathless men, 
working-men, students, sectionaries, read proclamations, cried: 
"To arms !” broke the street lamps, unharnessed waggons, tore up 
the pavements, broke in the doors of the houses, uprooted the trees, 
ransacked the cellars, rolled hogsheads, heaped up paving . stones, 
pebbles, pieces of furniture, boards, made barricades.

SAINT DENIS 897 

be the chief of the barricade a roll which looked like a roll of money. 
^^This/' said he, to pay the expenses, wine, et c cetera!^ A 3 oung 
man of a light complexion, without a cravat, went from one barricade 
to another carrying orders. Another, with drawn sword and a blue 
police cap on his head, was stationing sentinels^ In the interior, within 
the barricades, wine-shops and porters’ lodges were converted into 
guard-houses. Moreover, the emeute was conducted according to the 
soundest military tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full 
of turns and corners, were admirably chosen ; the environs of the 
markets in particular, a network of streets more intricate than a 
forest. The Society of the Friends of the People, it was said, had 
assumed the direction of the insurrection in the Quartief Sainte 
Avpye. A man, killed in Rue du Ponceau, who was searched, had a 
plan of Paris upon him. 

What had really assumed the direction of the emeute was a sort 
of unknown impetuosity which was in the atmosphere. The insur- 
rection, abruptly,. had built the barricades with one hand, and with 
the other seized nearly all the postil of the garrison. In less than three 
hours, like a train of powder which takes fire, the insurgents had 
invaded and occupied on the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayor’s 
office of the Place Royale, all the Marais, the Popincourt manufac- 
tory of arms, the Galiote, the Chateau d’Eau, all of the streets near 
the markets ; on the left bank, the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte 
Pelagie, the Place Maubert, the powder-mill nf the Deux Moulins, 
all the Barrieres. At five o’clock in the afternoon they were masters 
of the Bastille, the Lingerie, the Blancs Manteaux; their scouts 
touched the Place des Victoires, and threatened the Bank, the bar^ 
racks of the Petits Peres, and the Hotel des Postes. The third of 
Paris was in the emeute. 

At all points the struggle had commenced on a gigantic scale ; and 
from the disarmings, from the domiciliary visits, from the armour- 
ers’ shops' hastily invaded, there was this result,, that the combat 
which was commenced by throwing stones, was continued by 
throwing balls. 

About six o’clock in the afternoon, the arcade Du Saumon be- 
came a field of battle. The emeute was at one end, the troops at the 
end opposite. They fired from one grating to the other. On observer, 
a dreamer, the author of this book, who had gone to get a near view 
of the volcano, found himself caught in the arcade between the two 
fires. He had nothing but the projection of the pilasters which 
separate the shops to protect him from the balls ; he was nearly half 
an hour in this delicate situation. 

Meanwhile the drums beat the long roll, the National Guards 
dressed and armed themselves in haste, the legions left the mairies, 
the regiments left their barracks. Opposite the arcade De I’Ancre, a 
drummer received a thrust from a dagger. Another, on the Rue du 



898 I- K S M I S E R A B L E S 

Cygne, was assailed by some thirty yoim.j^ men, who destroyed his 
drum and took away liis sword. Another was killed in the Rue Gre- 
nier Saint Lazarc. .In the ivue Michel Ic Comte three officers fell 
dead one after another. Several Municipal Guards, wounded in the 
Rue des Lombards, turned back. 

In front of the Com* liatave, a detachment of National Guards 
found a red flag bearing this inscription : Republican revolution, No, 
127, Was it a reyolul ion, in fact ? 

The insurrection had matle the centre of Paris a sort of inextric- 
able, tortuous, colossal citadel. 

There was the focus, tlnn-e was evidently the (juest ion. All the rest 
were only skirmishes. W'hat proved that there all would be decided,"

In some regiments, tlu^ soldkr.s w(‘re doubt ful, which added to the 
friglilful obscurity of the crisis. 1'hey rtniuanbercd tlic popular ova- 
tion, which in July, hSdO, liad greeted the luaitrality of the 53rd of the

ets at tiu! coriuu's of the streets and b(ddly .sent patrols ouside of the 
barricades. Tht‘y kept watch &lt;»n InUli sides. The government, with 
an army in its hand, hesitated : night \yas coining on, and the tocsin 
of vSaint Merry began to be heard. The Minister of War of the 
time, Marshal" SouH, who liad seen Austerlitz, beheld this with 
gloomy C( lunlenance. 

These old saihirs, nceustom&lt;Hl lo ta.u*rect manoeuvring, and having 
no resource or guide, save tactics, that compass of Iiattles, are com- 
pletely lost: in ju'esence c»f that iininensi? foam which is called the

(mimxAtJTv OF VAms 

Within two years, as we have saitl, Paris liail seen more than one 
insnrreetton, Otitsirle of the insurgent ^piartier.s, nothing is usually 
more strangely calm than the i»hysu&gt;giiomy of Pari.s durinsr an 



SAINTDENIS 899 

aneute. Paris accustoms itself very quickly to everything — it is only 
an emeute — and Paris is so busy that it does not trouble itself for 
so slight a thing. These colossal cities alone can contain at the same 
time a civil war, and an indescribably strange tranquillity. Usually, 
when the insurrection begins, when the drum, the long-roll, the 
generale, are heard, the shopkeeper merely says : 

“It seems there is sonie squabble in the Rue Saint Martin/’ 

Or: 

“Faubourg Saint Antoine.” 

Often he adds with unconcern : 

“Somewhere down that way.” 

Afterwards when he distinguishes the dismal and thrilling uproar 
of musketry and the firing of platoons, the shopkeeper says : 

“It is getting warm, then ! Hullo, it is getting warm !” 

A moment afterwards, if the emeute approaches and increases, he 
precipitately shuts his shop, and hastily puts on his uniform ; that is 
to say, places his goods in safety and risks his person. 

There is firing at the street corners, in an arcade, in a cul-de-sac ; 
barricades are taken, lost, and retaken; blood flows, the fronts of 
the houses are riddled with grape, balls kill people in their beds, 
corpses encumber the pavement A few streets off, you hear the 
clicking of billiard balls in the cafes. 

The theatres open their doors and play comedies ; the curious chat 
and laugh two steps from these streets full of war. The fiacres jog 
along ; passers are going to dine in the city. Sometimes in the very 
quartier where there is fighting. In 1831 a fusilade was suspended 
to let a wedding party pass by. 

At the time of the insurrection of the 12th of May, 1839, in the 
Rue Saint' Martin, a little infirm old man, drawing a hand-cart sur- 
mounted by a tricoloured rag, in which there were decanters filled 
with some liquid, went back and forth from the barricade to the 
troops and from the troops to the barricade, impartially offering 
glasses of cocoa — now to the government, now to the anarchy... 

Nothing is more strange ; and this is the peculiar characteristic of 
the emeutes of Paris, which is not found in any other capital. Two 
things are requisite for it, the greatness of Paris and its gaiety. 
It requires the city of Voltaire and of Napoleon. 

This time, however, in the armed contest of the 5th of June, 1832, 
the great city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than, 
herself. She was afraid. You saw everywhere, in the most distant and 
the most “disinterested” quartiers,, doors, windows, and shutters 
closed ill broad day. The courageous armed, the poltroons hid. The 
careless and busy wayfarer disappeared. Many streets were as empty 
as at four o’clock in the morning. Alarming stories were circulated, 
ominous rumours were spread. “That they were masters of the 
Bank ;” “that, merelv at the cloisters of Saint Merry, there were

BOOK ELEVENTH 

THE ATOM FRATERNISES WITH THE HURRICANE 

I 

SOME INSIGHT INTO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE's POETRY 

INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN UPON THAT POETRY 

At the moment the insurrection, springing up at the shock of the 
people with the troops in front of the Arsenal, determined a back- 
ward movement in the multitude which was following the hearse 
and which, for the whole length of the boulevards, weighed, so to 
say, upon the head of the procession, there was a. frightful reflux. 
The mass wavered, the ranks broke, all ran, darted, slipped away, 
some with cries of attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great 
river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling, over- 
flowed on the right and on the left, and. poured in torrents into two 
hundred streets at once with the rushing of an opened mill-sluice. 
At this moment a ragged child who was coming down the Rue 
Menilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of laburnum in bloom, 
which he had just gathered on the heights of Belleville, caught sight, 
before a second-hand dealer's shop, of an old horse pistol. He threw 
his flowering branch upon the pavement, and cried : 

“Mother What's-your-name, I'll borrpw your machine." 

And he ran off with the pistol. 

Two minutes later, a flood of terrified bourgeois who were fleeing 
through the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, met the child who was 
brandishing his pistol and singing : 

La nuit on ne vpit rien, 

Le jour on voit tres-bien, 

D’un ecrit apocryphe 
Le bourgeois s^ouriffe, 

Pratiquez la vertu, 

Tutu chapeau pointu 1 

It was little Gavroche going to war. 

On the boulevard he perceived that the pistol had np hammer. 

Whose was this refrain jvhich served him to time his march, and 
all the other songs which, on occasion, he was fond of singing? we 
do not know. Who knows ? his own perhaps. Gavroche besides kept 
up with all the popular airs in circulation, and mingled with them 

901 



902 L E S Ml S E R'A B L E S 

his own warbling. A sprite and a devil, he made a medley of the 
voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory 
of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He knew some 
painter’s boys, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had been, as it ap- 
pears, three months a printer’s apprentice. He had done an errand 
one day for Monsieur, Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche 
was a gamin of letters. 

Gavroche moreover had no suspicion that on that wretched rainy 
night when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two 
brats, it was for his own brothers that he had acted the part of Pro- 
vidence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning ; such 
had been his night. On leaving the Rue des Ballets at early dawn, he 
had returned in haste to the elephant, artistically extracted the two 
momeSy shared with them such breakfast as he could invent, then 
went away, confiding them to that good mother, the street, who. had 
almost brought him up himself. On leaving them, he had given them 
rendezvous for the evening at the same place, and left them this 
discourse as a farewell : ^7 cut stick, otherwise spoken, 1 esbigne, or, 
as they say at the court, I haul off; Brats, if you don't find papa and 
mamma, come back here to-night. I will strike you up some supper 
and put you to bed!^ The two children, picked up by some sergent 
de ville and put in the retreat, or stolen^ by some mountebank, or 
simply lost in the immense Chinese Parisian turmoil, had not re- 
turned. The lower strata of the existing social world are full of these 
lost traces. Gavroche had not seen them since. Ten or twelve weeks 
had elapsed since that night. More than once he had scratched the 
top of his head and said: ‘Where the devil are my two children?” 

Meanwhile he had reached, pistol in hand, the Rue du Pont aux 
Choux. He noticed that there vyas now, in that street, but one shop 
open, and, a matter worthy of reflection, a pastry-cook’s shop. This 
was a providential opportunity to eat one more apple-puff before 
entering the unknown. Gavroche stopped, fumbled in his trousers, 
felt in his fob, turned out his pockets, found nothing in them, not a 
sou, and began to cry : “Help !” 

It is hard to lack the final cake. 

Gavroche none the less continued on his way. 

Two minutes later, he was in the Rue Saint Louis. While passing 
through the Rue du Parc Royal he felt the need of some compen- 
sation for the impossible apple-puff, and he gave himself the im- 
mense pleasure of tearing down the theatre posters in broad day. 

A little further along, seeing a group of well-to-do persons pass 
by, who appeared to him fo be men of property, he shrugged his 
shoulders, and spit out at random this mouthful of philosophic 
bile': 

“These rich men, how fat they are 1 they stuff themselves. They 
wallow in good dinners. Ask whaf with ttieir money. 



SAINT DENIS 903 

They don’t know an3"thing about it. They eat it, they do I How much 
of it the belly carries away.” 


II 

GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH 

The brandishing a pistol without a hammer, holding it in one’s 
hand in the open street, is such a public function that Gavroche felt 
his spirits rise higher with every step. He cried, between the snatches 
of the Marseillaise which he was singing: 

‘Tt’s all going well. I suffer a good deal in my left paw, I am 
broken with my rheumatism, but I am content, citizens. The bour- 
geois have nothing to do but to behave themselves, I am going to 
sneeze subversive couplets at them. What are the detectives ? they 
are dogs. By jinks ! don’t let us fail in respect for dogs. Now I wish 
I had one to my pistol.^ I come from the boulevard, my friends, it is 
getting hot, it is boiling over a little, it is simmering. It is time to 
skim the pot. Forward, men ! let their impure blood water the fur^ 
rows ! I give my days for my country. I shall never see my concubine 
again, n-e-ver, over, yes. Never ! but it’s all the same, let us be joyful ! 
let us fight, egad ! I have had enough of despotism.” 

At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard, who 
was passing, having fallen down, Gavroche laid his pistol on the 
pavement, and raised up the man, then he helped to raise the horse* 
After which he picked up his pistol, and resumed his way. 

In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace and silence. This apathy* 
suited to the Marais, contrasted with the vast surrounding uproar. 
Four gossips were chatting upon a doorstep. Scotland has her trios 
of witches, but Paris has her quartettes of gossips ; and the ‘'thou 
shalt be king,” would be quite as ominously cast at Bonaparte in the 
Baudoyer Square as at Macbeth in the heath of Armuyr. It would 
be almost the same croaking. 

The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny were busy only with their own 
affairs. They were three portresses and a rag-picker with her basket 
and hook. 

The four seemed standing at the four corners of old age, which, 
are decay, decrepitude, ruin, and sorrow. 

The rag-picker was humble. In this out-door society, the rag- 
picker bows, the poi'tress patronises. That is a result of the sweep- 
ings which are, as the portresses will, fat or lean, according to the 
fancy of her who makes the head. There may be kindness in the 
broom. 

This rag-picker was a grateful basket, and she smiled, what a 
smile ! to the three portresses. Such things as this were said : 

^ The French call the hammer of a pistol, the dog of it.

“Lud&lt;ly 1 cats, you know, are nat'rally the enemies of clogs. It is

“And folks, too.” 

“Still, cats’ fleas clon’t get on folks."

full extent, 

The rag-[&gt;lcker cried t 

“Spiteful go&gt;hare-jiaw.s!"

with a beard, I used to see him go by every morning with a young 
thing in a pink cap under his arm ; to-day I see him go by, he was 
giving his arm to a musket. Ma’am Bacheux says that there was a 
revolution last week at — at — at — ^where is the place ? — at Pontoise. 
And then see him there with his pistol, that horrid blackguard ? It 
seems the Celestins are all full of cannon. What would you have 
the government do with the scapegraces who do nothing but invent 
ways to disturb people, when we are beginning to be a little quiet, 
after all the troubles we have had, good Lord God, that poor queen 
that I see go by in the cart ! And all this is going to make snuff 
dearer still. It^is infamous ! and surely I will go to see you guillo- 
tined, you scoundrel.” 

‘‘You sniffle, my ancient,” said Gavroche. “Blow your promon- 
tory.” 

And he passed on. 

When he reached the Rue Pavee, the rag-picker recurred to his 
mind, and he soliloquised thus: 

“You do wrong to insult the Revolutionists, Mother Pleap-in-the- 
corner. This pistol is in your interest. It is so that you may have 
more things good to eat in your basket.” 

Suddenly he heard a noise behind him : it was the portress Patagon 
who had followed him, and who, from a distance, was shaking her 
fist at him, crying : 

“You are nothing but a bastard !” 

“Yes,” said Gavroche, “I amuse myself at that in a profound 
manner.” 

Soon after, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he shouted 
out his appeal : 

“En route for battle !” 

And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He looked at his 
pistol with a reproachful air, which seemed an endeavour to soften 
it : 

“I go off,” said he to it, “but you do not go off.” 

One dog may distract attention from another. A very lean cur 
was passing. Gavroche was moved to pity. * 

“My poor bow-wow,” said he, “have you swallowed a barrell, 
fhen, that all the hoops show?” 

Then he bent his steps towards the Orme Saint Gervais. 

^III 

JUST INDIGNATION OF A BARBER 

The worthy barber, who drove away the two little boys to whom 
Gavroche opened the paternal intestines of the elephant, was at this 
moment in his shop, busy shaving an old legionary soldier who had 



906 LES MISERABLES 

served under the empire. 1 licy were chatting. Fh^barber had natur- 
ally spoken to the veteran of the emeute, then of General Lamarque, 
and from Lamarque they had come to the ein])eror. lienee a conver- 
sation between a barber and a soldier, which Prudhomme, if he had 
been present, would have enriched witli arabesques, and which he 
would have entitled : Dklugitc of the niaor and the sabre. 

“Monsieur,” said the wig-maker, “how did tire emperor mount 

on horseback ?” - „ r- , r „ 

“Badly. He didn’t know how to fall. So he never fell.’ 

“Did he have fine horses? he must have had jinc horses !” 

“The dav he gave me the cross, 1 noticed his animal. She was a 
running mare, perfectly white. 1 ler ears were, very wide apart, sad- 
dle deep, head line, marked with a black star, neck very long, knees 
strongly jointed, ribs protruding, shoidders sloping, hind quarters 
powerful. A little more than fifteen hands high.” 

“A pretty horse,’’ said the barber. ^ 

“It was the animal of his majesty." 

The barber felt that tifter this word a little silence was proper, 
he conformed to it, then resumed : 

“1'hc emperor was never wounded but once, was he, monsieur?” 

The old soldier answered with the calm and sovereign tone of a 
man who was there : 

“In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as he 
was that day. lie was :is neat as a penny.” 

“And you, Monsieur Veteran, you must have been wounded of- 
ten?" 

“I?” said the soldier, “ah ! no peat thing. I got two sabre slashes 
in my neck at Mtirengo. a liall in iny right ;irm at Austerlitz, an- 
other in nty left hip at Jena, at b'riediand a bayonet thrust— there,, 
—at Jiloscow seven or eight lance thrusts, no matter where, at Lut- 
zen a .shell hurst which cnislied m.y linger—.Mi ! ;md then at Water- 
loo a hullet in mv leg. 'I’liat is aU.” 

“How beautiful it is," exclaimed the barber with a pindaric ac- 
cent, “to die, o’n the field of battle! Ppon my word, rather than die 
in my lied, of .sickness, .slowly, a little every day, with drugs, plas- 
ters, syringes, anti metheine, I wtuild prefer a cannon ball in my 

tt’liy.” 

“Von are not fastidktns," stiit! the soither. 

He had litirtlly fmishetl when a frightful crash shook the shop. 
A pane tif the wintlow had heen .sudtlenly shattered. 

The litirber liecame pallid. 

“O God !" cried he, “liiere is one !” 


“What?" 

“A cannon Imll." 

“Here it is,” said the soldier. 



SAINT DENIS 90 ) 

And he picked up something which was rolling on the- floor. 
was a stone. 

The barber ran to the broken window and saw Gavroche, who 
was running with all his might towards the Saint Jean market. On 
passing the barber’s shop, Gavroche, who had the two momes on 
his mind, could not resist the desire to bid him good day, and had 
sent a stone through his sash. 

‘"See!” screamed the barber, who from white had become blue, 
*'he makes mischief for the sake of mischief. What has anybody 
done to that gamin 


IV 

THE CHILD WONDERS AT THE OLD MAN 

Meanwhile Gavroche at the Saint Jean market where the 
guard was already disarmed, had just — effected his junction — ^with 
a band led by Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Feuilly. They 
were almost armed. Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had joined them 
and enlarged the group. Enjolras had a double-barrelled fowling 
piece. Combeferre a National Guard’s musket bearing the number 
of the legion, and at his waist two pistols which could be seen, his 
coat being unbuttoned, Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musketoon, 
Bahorel a carbine; Courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed 
sword-cane. Feuilly, a drawn sabre in his hand, marched in the van, 
crying : ‘‘Poland for ever !.” 

They came from the Quai Morland cravatless, hatless, breath- 
less, soaked by the rain, lightning in their eyes. Gavroche ap- 
proached them calmly : 

“Where are we going ?” 

“Come on,” said Courfeyrac. 

Behind Feuilly marched, dr rather bounded, Bahorel, a fish in 
the water of the emeute. He had a crimson waistcoat, and those 
words which crush everything. His waistcoat overcame a passer, 
who cried out in desperation : 

“There are the reds !” 

“The reds, the reds !” replied Bahorel. “A comical fear, bour- 
geois. As for me, I don’t tremble before a red poppy, the little red 
hood inspires me with no dismay. Bourgeois, believe me, leave the 
fear of red to horned cattle.” 

He caught sight of a piece of wall on which was placarded the 
most peaceful sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, 
a charge for Lent, addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his 
“ouailles” [flock]. 

Bahorel exclaimed : 

^^Ouailles; polite way of saying oies'* [geese]. 



^■&gt;08 L E S U I S K K A li L K S 

And he tore tne char^'e from the wall. 1'his coiujuered Gavrochc 
From tliat moment, GavrtK'he bej^an in sliuly I'ahorel. 

‘‘Bahorcl,’” observed Enjolras, “you arc wn)ni^^ \'ou should have

expending your wrath uselessly* Feonomist* your arnnnmition. We 
don’t lire out of rank, — more with the soul tlian with the nin” 
*'Eachin his own way, bhijbdras/’ retorted Bahorel. “'riiis bishop’s

raining all the morning, and was raining hard at that very moment. 
Courfeyrac recognised Father Mabeuf . He knew him from having 
seen him many times accompanying Marius to the door. Knowing 
the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old church- warden- 
book- worm, and astounded at seeing him in the midst of this tumult, 
within two steps of the cavalry charges, almost in the midst of a 
fusilade, bareheaded in the rain, and walking among the bullets, 
he went up to him, and the emeuter of five-and-twenty and the oc- 
togenarian exchanged this dialogue: 

'^Monsieur Mabeuf, go home.’’ 

‘‘What for?" 

“There is going to be a row.” 

“Very well,” 

“Sabre strokes, musket shots. Monsieur Mabeuf.” 

“Very well” 

“Cannon shots,” 

“Very well Where are you going, you boys?” 

“We are going to pitch the government over.” 

“Very well” 

And he followed them. From that moment he had not uttered a 
word. His step had suddenly become firm ; some workingmen had 
offered him an arm, he refused with a shake of the head. He advanced 
almost to the front rank of the column, having at once the motion 
of a man who is walking, and the countenance of a man who is 
asleep. 

“What a desperate goodman !” murmured the students. The 
rumour ran through the assemblage that he was — an ancient Con- 
vetitionist — an old regicide. The company had turned into the Rue 
de la Verrerie.

'Well, if you call'me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again, I shall cal]

'^There is somebody who wishes to speak to you.’* 

‘Who is it?” 

*‘I don’t know.” 

‘Where is he?” 

“In my lodge.” 

“The devil !” said Courfeyrac. 

“But he has been waiting more than an hour for you to ooine 
home !” replied the portress. 

At the same time, a sort of young working-man, thin, pale, small, 
freckled, dressed in a torn blouse and patched pantaloons of ribbed 
velvet, and who had rather the appearance of a girl in boy’s clothes 
than of a man, came out of the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a 
voice which, to be sure, was not the least in the world like a woman’s 
voice. 

“Monsieur Marius, if you please?” 

“He is not in.” 

“Will he be in this evening?” 

“I don’t know anything about it.” 

And Courfeyrac added: “As for myself, I shall not be in.” 

The young man looked fixedly at hihi, and asked him : 

“Why so?” 

“Because.” 

“Where are you going then ?’* 

“What is that to you ?” 

“Do you want me to carry your box ?” 

“I am going to the barricades.” 

“Do you want me to go with you ?” 

“If you like,” answered Courfeyrac. “The road is free ; the streets 
belong to everybody.” 

And he i"an of? to rejoin his friends. When he had rejoined them, 
he gave the box to one of them to carry. It was not until a quarter 
of an hour afterwards that he perceived that the young man had in’ 
fact followed them. 

A mob does not go precisely where it wishes. We have explained 
that a gust of wind carries it along. They went beyond Saint Merry 
and found themselves, without really knowing how, in the Rue 
Saint Denis.

as if by chance, and separated but slightly, like blocks of stone in a 
stone yard, by narrow crevices. 

We say narrow crevices, and we cannot give a more just idea of 
those obscure, contracted, angular lanes, bordered by ruins eight 
stoides high. These houses were so dilapidated, that in the Rues 
de la Chanyrerie and de la Petite Truanderie, the fronts were 
shored up with beams, reaching from one house to another. The 
street was narrow and the gutter wide, the passer walked along a 
pavement which was always wet, beside shops that were like cellars, 
great stone blocks encircled with iron, immense garbage heaps, and 
alley gates armed with enormous and venerable gratings. The Rue 
Rambuteau has devastated all this. 

The name Mondetour pictures marvellously well the windings 
of all this route. A little further along you found them still better 
expressed by the Rue Pirouette^ which ran into the Rue Mondetour. 

The passer who came from the Rue Saint Denis into the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie saw it gradually narrow away before him as if he 
had entered an elongated funnel. At the end of the street, which was 
very short, he found the passage barred on the market side, and he 
would have thought himself in a cul-de-sac, if he had not perceived 
on the right and on the left two black openings by which he could 
escape. These were the Rue Mondetour, which communicated on 
the one side with the Rue des Precheurs, on the other with the Rues 
du Cygne and Petite Truanderie. At the end of this sort of cul-de- 
sac, at the corner of the opening on the right, might be seen a house 
lower than the rest, and forming a kind of cape on the street. 

In this house, only two stories high, had been festively installed 
for three hundred years an illustrious wine-shop. This^ wine-shop 
raised a joyful sound in the very place which old Theophile has 
rendered famous in these two lines : 

La branie Ic sqiielette horrible 
D’un pauvre amant qui se pendit.^ 

The location was good. The proprietorship descended from father 

to son. , . . , j 

In the times of Mathurin Regnier, this wme-shop was called 
the Pot aux Roses (the Pot of Roses), and as rebuses were in fash- 
ion, it had for a sign a post {poteau) painted rose colour. In the last 
century, the worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters now held 
in disdain by the rigid school, having got tipsy several times in this 
wine-shop at the same table where Regnier had got drunk, out of 
gratitude painted a bunch of Corinth grapes upon the rose-coloured 
post. The landlord, from joy, changed his sign and had gilded be- 
low the bunch these words : The Grape of C onntK Hence the name 

* There rattles the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who hung himself.

A basement room in whieli was tin* counter, a room on the first 
floor in which was the In'IIiard table, a sjiiral wooden staircase pierc-

the basement-room led to the cellar. ( )n the second floor were the 
rooms of the l Iticheloni)s. Wm asccndcil by a stairway, which was

returned on account of Carpes au Gras, They drank there, they 
ate there, they shouted there ; they paid little, they paid poorly, they 
did not pay at all, they were always welcome. Father Hucheloup

Hucheloup, a goodman, we have just said, was a cook with mous- 
taches : an amusing variety. He had always an ill-humoured face, 
seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at people 
who came to his house, and appeared more disposed to pick a quar- 
rel with them than to serve them their soup. And still, we maintain, 
they were always welcome. This oddity had brought custom to his 
shop, and led young men to him, saying to each other : ^^Come and 
hear Father Hucheloup grumble.^' He had been a fencing-master. 
He would suddenly burst out laughing. Coarse voice, good devil. 
His was a comic heart, with a tragic face ; he asked nothing better 
than to frighten you, much like those snuff-boxes which have the 
shape of a pistol. The discharge is a sneeze. 

His wife was Mother Hucheloup, a bearded creature, an(4 very^ 
ugly. 

Towards 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him the secret of the 
carpes au gras was lost. His widow, scarcely consolable, continued 
the wine-shop. But the cuisine degenerated and became execrable, 
the wine, which had always been bad became frightful. Courfey- 
rac and his friends continued to go to Corinth, however — ^‘‘from 
pity,*' said Bossuet. 

Widow Hucheloup was short-winded and deformed, with memo-* 
ries of the country. She relieved their tiresomeness by her pro- 
nunciation. She had a way of her own of saying things which spiced 
her village and spring-time reminiscences, it had once been her 
fortune, she affirmed, to hear ^^the lead-breasts sing in the hawk-* 
thorns.” 

The room on the first floor, in which was ^'the restaurant,” was a 
long and wide room, encumbered with stools, crickets, chairs, 
benches, and tables, and a rickety old billiard-table. It was reached 
by the spiral staircase which terminated at the corner of the room, 
in a square hole like the hatchway of a ship. 

This room, lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp 
which was always burning, had the appearance of a garret. All the 
pieces of furniture on four legs behaved as if tliey had but three.. 
The whitewa'shed walls had no ornament except this quatrain in 
honour of Ma'am Hucheloup : 

Elle ^tonne a dix pas, elle 4pouvante i deux, 

Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux ;

The wine-shop was empty; they two only were there. 

Fricassee, recognising Joly and Laigle, put a bottle of wine oiv 
the table. 

As they were at their first oysters; a head appeared at the hatch- 
way of the stairs, and a .voice said : 

‘T was passing. I smelt in the street a delicious odour of Brie 
cheese, I have come in.” 

It was Grantaire. 

Grantaire took a stool and sat down at the table. 

Fricassee, seeing Grantaire, put two bottles of wine on the tabl^. 

That made three. 

“Are you going to drink those two bottles?” inquired Laigle of 
Grantaire. 

Grantaire answered : 

“All are ingenious, you alone are ingenuous* Two^Dottles never 
astonished a man.” 

The others had begun by eating. Grantaire began by drinking, 
A half hottU was quickly swallowed. 

“Have you a hole in your stomach ?” resumed Laigle* 

“You surely have one in your elbqw,” said Grantaire. 

And, after emptying his glass, Ke added : 

“Ah, now, Laigle of the funeral orations, your coat is old.” 

“I hope so,” replied Laigle. “That makes us agree so well, my coat 
and I. It has got all my wrinkles, it doesn't bind me anywhere, it has 
fitted itself tt) all my deformities, it is complaisant to all my motions ; 
I feel it only because it keeps me warm. Old coats are the same thing 
as old friends.” 

“That’s true,” exclaimed Joly, joining in the dialogue, “an old 
habit [coat] is an old abi [friend].” 

“Especially,” said Grantaire, “in the mouth of a man whose head 
is stopped up.” 

“Grantaire,” asked Laigle, “do you come' from the boulevard ?” 

“No.” . 

“We just saw the head of the procession pass, Joly and I*’/ 

“It is a barvellous spectacle,” said Joly. 

“Flow quiet this street is !” exclaimed Laigle. “Who would sus- 
pect that Paris is all topsy-turvy? You see this was formerly all 
monasteries about here ! Du Breul and Sauval give the list of them, 
and the Abbe Lebeuf . They were all around here, they swarmed, 
the shod, the unshod, the shaven, the bearded, the greys, the blacks, 
the whites, the Franciscans, the Minimi, the Capuchins, the Car- 
melites, the Lesser Augustines, the Greater Augustines, the Old 
Augustines. They littered.” 

“Don’t talk about monks,” interrupted Grantaire, “it makes me 
want to scratch.” 

Then he exclaimed ;

not go. Quick, a revolution., God has his hands black with this vil- 
lanous cart-grease all the time. In his place, I would work more 
simply, I wouldn’t be winding up rhy machine every minute, I would 
lead the human race smoothly, I would knit the facts stitch to stitch, 
without breaking the thread, I would have no emergency, I would 
have no extraordinary repertory. What you fellows call progress 
moves by two springs, men and events. But sad to say, from time to 
time the exceptional is necessary. For events as well as for men, 
the stock company is not enough ; geniuses are needed among men, 
and revolutions among events. Great accidents are the law ; the or- 
der of things cannot get along without them ; and, to see the ap- 
paritions of comets, one would be tempted to believe that Heaven 
itself is in need of star actors. At the moment you least expect it, 
God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some strange 
star comes along, underlined by an enormous tail. And that makes 
Csesar die. Brutus strikes him with a knife, and God with a comet. 
Crack, there is an aurora borealis, there is a revolution, there is a 
great man; ’93 in big letters. Napoleon with a line to himself, the 
comet of 1811 at the top of the poster. Ah ! the beautiful blue poster, 
all studded with unexpected flourishes! Boom! boom! extraor- 
dinary spectacle. Look up, loungers. All is dishevelled, the star as 
well as the drama. Good God, it is too much, and it is not enough. 
These resources, used in emergency, seem magnificence, and are 
poverty. My friends. Providence is put to his trumps. A revolution, 
what does that prove ? That God is hard up. He makes a coup d'etat, 
because there is a solution of continuity between the present and the 
future, and because he, God, is unable to join the two ends. In fact, 
that confirms me in my conjectures about the condition of Jeho- 
vah’s fortune ; and to see so much discomfort above and below, so 
much rascality and odiousnes.s and stinginess and distress in the 
heavens and on the earth, from the bird which has not a grain of 
millet to me who have not a hundred thousand livres of income, to 
see human destiny, which is very much worn out, and even royal 
destiny, which shows the warp, witness the Prince of Conde hung, 
to see winter, which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which 
the wind blows, to see so many tatters even in the bran new purple 
of the morning on the tops of the hills, to see the dew drops, those 
false peai’ls, to see the frost, that paste, to see huinanity ripped, and 
events patched, and so many spots on the sun, and so.many holes in 
the moon, to see so much misery everywhere, I suspect that God is not 
rich. He keeps up appearances,, it is true, but I feel the pinch. He 
gives a revolution as a merchant, whose credit is low, gives a ball. 
We must not judge the gods from appearances. Beneath the gilding 
of the sky I catch a glimpse of a poor universe. Creation is bank- 
rupt. That is why I.am a malcontent. See, it is the fifth of June, it is 
very dark; since morning I have been waiting for the d^break, it

Marius is a fog, and he must have found a vapour. Marius is of the 
race of poets. He who says poet, says fool. TymbrcBus Apollo, Ma- 
rius and his Mary, or his Maria, or his Marietta, or his Marion, 
they must make droll lovers. I imagine how it is. Ecstasies where 
they forget to kiss. Chaste upon the earth, but coupling in the in- 
finite. They are souls which have senses. They sleep together in the 
stars.’' 

Grantaire was entering on his second bottle, and perhaps his 
second harangue, when a new actor emerged from the square hole 
of the stairway. It was a boy of less than ten years, ragged, very 
small, yellow, a mug of a face, a keen eye, monstrous long hair, wet 
to the skin, a complacent look. 

The child, choosing without hesitation among the three, although 
he evidently knew none of them, addressed himself to Laigle de 
Meaux. 

^'Are you Monsieur Bossuet?” asked he. 

‘'That is my nickname,’- answered Laigle. “What do you want 
of me?” 

“This is it. A big light-complexioaed fellow on the boulevard 
said to me; Do you know Mother Hucheloup? I said: Yes, Rue 
Chanvrerie, the widow of the old man. He said to me. Go there. 
You will find Monsieur Bossuet there, and you will tell him from 
me: A — B — C. It is a joke that somebody is playing on you, isn’t 
it ? He gave me ten sous.” 

“Joly, lend me ten sous,” said Laigle, and turning towards Gran- 
taire : “Grantaire, lend me ten sous.” 

This made twenty sous which Laigle gave the child. 

“Thank you, monsieur,” said the little fellow. 

“What is your name ?” asked laigle. 

“Navet, Gavroche’s friend.” 

“Stop with us,” said Laigle. 

“Bi'eakfast with us,” said Grantaire. 

The child answered : 

“I can’t, I am with the procession, I am the one to cry, Down with 
Polignac.” 

And giving his foot a long scrape behind him, which is the most 
respectful of all possible bows, he went away. 

The child gone, Grantaire resmued : 

, “This is the pure gamin. There are many varieties in the gamin 
genus. The notary gamin is called saute-ruisseau, the cook gamin is 
called marmiton, the baker ga)0n is called mitron, the lackey gamin 
is called groom, the sailor gamin is called mousse, the soldier gamin 
is called tapin, the painter gamin is called rapin, the trader gamin is 
called trot tin, the courtier gamin is called menin, the king gamin is 
czlltd dauphin, the god gamin is called bambino.^' 

Meanwhile Laigle was meditating; he said in an under tone ;

SAINTDENIS 923 

three vapours, beer, brandy, and absinth, that the lead of the soul 
is formed.. They are three darknesses; the celestial butterfly is 
drowned in them ; and there arise, in a membranous smoke vaguely 
condensed^ into bat wings, three dumb furies, nightmare, night, 
death,' flitting above the sleeping Psyche. 

Grantaire was not yet at this dreary phase ; far from it He was 
extravagantly gay, and Bossuet and Joly kept pace with him. They 
touched glasses. Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of his 
words and ideas incoherency of gesture; he rested his left wrist 
upon his knee with dignity, his arms a-kimbo, and his cravat untied, 
bestriding a stool, his full glass in his right hand, he threw out to 
the fat servant Chowder these solemn words : 

“Let the palace doors be opened! Let everybody belong to the 
Academic Frangaise, and have the right of embracing Madame 
Hucheloup ! ' let us drink.” 

And turning towards Ma'am Hucheloup he added : 

“Antique woman consecrated by use, approach that I may gsize 
upon thee 1” 

And Joly exclainied : 

“Chowder add Fricassee, dod't give Gradtaire ady bore to drigk. 
He spedds his bodey foolishly. He has already devoured sidce this 
bordigg in desperate prodigality two f rages didety-five cedtibes.” 

And Grantaire replied : 

“Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission to 
put them on the table in the shape of candles ?” 

Bossuet, very drunk, had preserved his calmness. 

Fie sat in the open window, wetting his back with the falling rain, 
and gazed at his two friends. 

Suddenly he heard a tumult behind him, hurried steps, cries 
arms! He turned, and saw in the Rue Saint Denis, at the end of the* 
Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, carbine in hand, and Gav- 
roche with his pistol, Feuilly with his sabre, Courfeyrac with his 
sword, Jean Propvaire with his musketoon, Combef erre with his 
musket, Bahorel with his musket, and all the armed and stormy 
gathering which followed them. 

The Rue de la Chanvrerie was hardly as long as the range of a 
carbine. Bossuet improvised a speaking trumpet with his two hands, 
and shouted : 

“Courfeyrac 1 Courfeyrac ! ahoy 1” n 

Courfeyrac heard the call, perceived Bossuet, and came a few steps 
into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, crying a “what do you want ?” which 
was met on the way by a “where are you going ?” 

“To make a barricade,” answered Courfeyrac. 

“Well, here 1 this is a good place ! make it here 1” 

“Tloat is true, Eagle,” said Courfeyrac. 

And at a sign from Courfeyrac;. the barid rushed into the Rue de 
la Chanvrerie.

NIGHT BEGINS TO GATHKU OVER CKANTAIRE 

The place was indeed adniirahly ehnson, the entrance of the street 
■wide, the further end eonlraeio&lt;l an&lt;l lilve a cul-de-sac, Corinth 
throttling it. Rue Mumletour easy to l&gt;ar at the right and left, no at- 
tack possilde except from the Rue Saint nenis, that is from the 
front, and without cover. Bossuel tipsy had the coup d’ccil of Han- 
nibal fasting. ■ , , 

At the irruption of the mem, ehsniay seized the whole street, not 
a passer hut had gone into eclipse. In a Hash, at the end, on the right, 
on the left, shops, stalls, alley gales, wimlnws, blinds, dormer- 
windows, shutters of every size, were cliised front the ground to the 
roofs. One frightened old woman li-ad lixed a mattress before her 
window on two clothes poles, as a shield against the musketry. The 
wine-shop was the. otily lionse which remaim^d open ; and that for 
a good rea.sim, heeanse the hand ha'd rnshed into it. “Oh my God! 
Oh my Coil!” siglietl Ma'am lluehelotip. 

Bo.ssuel had gone down to meet Courfeyrac. 

Joly, who had come to tlie window, cried: 

“Cotirfeyrae. ymt hiist take ad uhhrella. h'uu will catch cold.” 

Meanwhile, in* a few minnle.s, twenty iron liars had been wrested 
from the grateil front of the wine-shop, twenty yards of pavement 
had been torn up; Cavroehe and Balmrel hail seized on its passage 
and tipped over the. dray of ;i lime merchant named Anceau, this 
dray contained three barrels full of Hme, which they had placed 
under the piles of paving stones; ICnjulrtis had opened the trap- 
door of the cellar ami all the widow I luchelonp’.s empty casks had 
gone to flank the lime barrels ; h'euilly, with his fingers accustomed 
to colour the delicate folds of faiis.iiad Imllressed the barrels and the 
dray with two massive heaps of stones, .Stones improvised like the 
rest, and uht.-iined nohody knows where. Some shoring-timbers had 
been jiulled down from tlie front of a neiglibonring house and laid 
upon the casks. When Bossnet atnl Cotirfeyrae tuniecl round, half 
the street was already Iwrred hy a nimpart liiglier than a man. 
T’here is nothing like llie j«i|iular hnml to hnikl whatever can be built 
by demolishing. 

Cliowder ami I'ricassee hail joined the lalsatrers. I'ricassee went 
back and forth loaded with nihhish. Her wetiriness contributed to 
the liarrieatle. She servetl jwviug stones, as she would have served 
wine, with a sleepy air. 

An oninihiis with two white fiorses passed at the end of the street. 

Bossuet .sprang over the pavement, ran, slopjied the driver, made 
liie passengers get down, gave hi."i liand “to the ladies,” dismissed 



SAINTDENIS 925 

the conductor, and came back with the vehicle, leading the horses 
by the bridle, 

“An omnibus,^’ said he, “doesn’t pass by Corinth. Non licet omni-- 
bus adire Corinthum'^ 

A moment later the horses were unhitched and going off at will 
through the Rue Mondetour, and the omnibus, lying on its side 
completed the barring of the street 

Ma’am Hucheloup, completely upset, had taken refuge in the first 
story. 

Her eyes were wandering, and she looked without seeing, crying 
in a whisper. Her cries were dismayed and dared not come out of her 
throat. 

, “It. is the end of the world,” she murmured. 

•Joly deposited a kiss upon Ma’am Hucheloup’s coarse, red, and 
wrinkled neck, and said to Grantaire : “My dear fellow, I have al- 
ways considered a woman’s neck an infinitely delicate thing.” 

But Grantaire was attaining the highest regions of dithyramb. 
Chowder having come up to the first floor, Grantaire seized her by 
the waist and pulled her towards the window with long bursts of 
laughter, 

“Chowder is ugly !” cried he ; “Chowder is the dream of ugliness ! 
Chowder is a chimera. Listen to the secret of her birth : a Gothic 
Pygmalion who was making cathedral waterspouts, fell in love 
with one of them one fine morning, the most horrible of all. He im- 
plored Love to animate her, and that made Chowder. Behold her, 
citizens ! her hair is the colour of chromate of lead, like that of 
Titian’s mistress, and she is a good girl. I warrant you that she 
will fight well. Every good girl contains a hero. As for Mother 
Hucheloup, she is an old brave. Look at her moustaches ! she in- 
herited them from her husband. A hussaress, indeed, she will fight 
too. They two by themselves will frighten the banlieue. Comrades, 
we will overturn the government, as true as there are fifteen acids 
intermediate between margaric acid and formic acid, which I don’t 
care a fig about. Messieurs, my father always detested me, because 
I could not understand mathematics. I only understand love and 
liberty, I am Grantaire, a good boy. Never having had any money, 
I have never got used to it, and by that means I have never felt the 
need of it; but if I had been rich, there would have been no more 
poor! you should have seen. Oh! if the good hearts had the fat 
purses, how much better everything would go! I imagine Jesus 
Christ with Rothschild’s fortune ! How much good he would have 
done ! Chowder, embrace me ! you are voluptuous and timid !, you 
have cheeks which call for the kiss of a sister, and lips which de ' 
mand the kiss of a lover.” 

“Be still, wine-cask I” said Courf eyraci 

Grantaire answered : 



926 ' L E S M I s ft K A 1U- H S 

“I am Capitoul aiid Master of l-loral Games !” 

Eniolras, who was slaiulins on the crest of the harncade, musket 
in hand raised his fine austere face, h.njolras, we knour, had some- 
tlunff of the Spartan and of the Puritan. He would have died at 
Themiopylte with ].eonidas, and woul&lt;I have Imrned Drogheda with

“Grantaire.” cried he, go sleep yourself sober away from here. 
This is the place for intoxication and not for tlrunkenncss. Do not 

dishonour the barricmle!’’ r&gt; . • • i 

This angry speecii jtrodneed upon C.rantaire a singular effect. 
One woukriiave said that he ha«l received a glass of cold water in 
his face, lie upiieared suddenly .soliereil. 1 h- sal down, leaned upon 
a 'talile near llie window, looked at Enjolr.as with an inexpressible 
gentleness, and .said to him t

Rut Grantaire, keeping his ti-n«!er and trouhled eyes fixed upon 
him, answered : 

“Let me sleep Viere- nnlil 1 die here, 
h'.njolras regarded him with a disdainful eye; 

“Grantaire. you are ineapahle of belief, of thought, of will, of 

life, and of death.’" • t,- it i i ,i i • i j 

He stamniered out tt few iiiot e intintelligllile wtmls, then his head

satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman who, having received 
a blow from her husband, went to complain to her father, crying 
for vengeance and saying: ‘Tather, you owe my husband affront 
for affront/’ The father asked : “Upon which cheek did you receive 
the blow?” “Upon the left cheek.” The father struck the right 
cheek, and said : “Now you are satisfied. Go and tell your husband 
that he has struck my daughter, but that I have struck his wife.” 

The rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Some working-men 
had brought under their blouses a keg of powder, a hamper contain- 
ing bottles of vitriol, two or three carnival torches, and a basket full 
of lamps, “relics of the king’s fete,” which fete was quite recent, 
having taken place the 1st of May. It was said that these supplies 
came from a grocer of the Faubourg Saint Antoine, named Pepin. 
They broke the only lamp in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the lamp op- 
posite the Rue Saint Denis, and all the lamps in the surrounding 
streets. Mondetour, du Cygne, des Prccheurs, and de la Grande, 
and de la Petite Truanderie. 

Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, directed everything. Two 
barricades were now building at the same time, both resting on the 
house of Corinth and making a right angle ; the larger one closed 
the Rue de la Chanyreide, the other closed the Rue Mondetour in. 
the direction of the Rue du Cygne. This last barricade, very narrow, 
was constructed only of casks and paving stones. There were about 
fifty labourers there, some thirty armed with muskets, for, on their 
way, they had effected a wholesale loan from an armourer’s shop. 

Nothing could be more fantastic and more motley than this band. 
One had a short- jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two horse-pistols ; an- 
other was in shirt sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-horn 
hung at his side ; a third had a breast-plate of nine sheets of brown 
paper, and was armed with a saddler’s awl. There was one of them 
who cried : ^'Lct us exterminate to the last man, and die on the' point 
of our bayonctsT This man had no bayonet. Another displayed 
over his coat a cross-belt and cartridge-box of the National Guard, 
with the box cover adorned with this inscription in red cloth: Pub-- 
He Order, Many muskets bearing the numbers of their legions, few 
hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this all ages, 
all faces, small pale young men, 'bronzed wharfmen. All were hur- 
rying, and, while helping- each other, they talked about the possible 
chances — that they would have help by three o’clock in the morn- 
ing — that they wex'e sure of one regiment — ^that Paris would rise. 
Terrible subjects, with which were mingled a sort of cordial jovial- 
ity. One would have said they were brothers, they c^id not know 
each other’s names. Great perils have this beauty, that they bring 
to light the fraternity of strangers. 

A fire had been kindled in the kitchen, and they were melting 
pitchers, dishes, forks, all the pewter ware of the wine-shop into

Still, he was furious at his pistol without a hammer. He went 
from one to another, demanding: “A musket? I want a musket? 
Why don't you give me a musket ?" 

''A musket for you ?" said Combef erre. 

"Well?'' replied Gavroche, ""why,not? I had one in 1830, in the 
dispute with Charles X." 

Enjolras shrugged his shoulders. 

""When there are enough for the men, we will give them to the 
children." 

Gavroche turned fiercely, and answered him : 

""If you are killed before me, I will take yours." 

Gamin r said Enjolras. 

""Smooth-face ?" said Gavroche. 

A stray dandy who was lounging at the end of the street made 
a diversion.. 

Gavroche cried to him : 

""Come with us, young man? Well, this poor old country, you 
won't do anything for her then ?” 

The dandy fled. 


V 

THE PREPARATIONS 

The journals of the time which said that the barricade of the Rue 
de la Chanvrerie, that almost inexpugnable construction, as they 
call it, attained the level of a second story, were mistaken. The fact 
is, that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It 
was built in such a mann|fchat the combatants could, at will, either 
disappear behind the wiffjror look over it, and even scale the crest 
of it by means of a quadruple range of paving-stones 'superposed 
and arranged like steps* on the inner side. The front of the barricade 
on the outside, composed of piles of paving-stones and of barrels 
bound together by timbers and boards which were interlocked in 
the wheels of the Anceau cart and the overturned omnibus, had a 
bristling and inextricable aspect. 

An opening sufficient for a man to pass through had been left be- 
tween the wall of the houses and the extremity of the bandcade 
furthest from the wine-shop ; so that a sortie was possible. The pole 
of the omnibus was turned directly up and held with ropes, and. a 
red flag, fixed to this pole, floated over the barricade. 

The little Mondetour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop, 
was not visible. The two barricades united formed a staunch re- 
doubt. Enjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought proper to barri- 



930 I' ^ ‘ ^ *’• “ '• ^ 

cadi: the other end of the Hne Mondetnnr which opens a passage 
to the markets thrmif;h the Hue ties Privlienrs, wishing doubtless to 
preserve a pt&gt;ssihU‘ cunimuiucation witli the outside, and having 
little dread of being atlarked from the dangerous and difficult alley 
ties Precheurs. . ^ 

Except this passage reniamnig tree, wliu'h ci'iistituted what Fo-

WHILE WAITING 

In these hours of waiting what did they do? This we must tell — 
for this is history. 

While the men were making cartridges and the women lint, while 
a large frying-pan, full of melted pewter and lead, destined for the 
bullet-mould, was smoking over a burning furnace, while the 
videttes were watching the barricades with arms in their hands, 
while Enjolras, whom nothing could distract, was watching the 
videttes, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Bos- 
suet, Joly, Bahorel, a few others besides, sought each other and got 
together, as in the most peaceful days of their student-chats, and in 
a corner of this wine-shop changed into a casemate, within two 
steps of the redoubt which they had thrown up, their carbines 
primed and loaded resting on the backs of their chairs, these gal- 
lant young men, so near their last hour, began to sing love-rhymes. 

What rhynies ? Here they are : 

Vous rappel e 2 -vous iiotre douce vie, 

Lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux, 

Et que nous n’avions au coeur d*autre envie 
Que d’etre bien mis et d’etre amoureux. 

Lorsqu’en ajoutant votre age a mon age, 

Nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans, 

Et que, dans notre humble et petit menage. 

Tout, meme I’hiver, nous etait printemps? 

» 

Beaux jours ! Manuel dtait fier et sage, 

Paris s’asseyait a de saints banquets, 

Foy lanqait la foudre, et votre corsage 
Avait une ^piijigle oit je me piquais. 

Tout vous contemplait Avocat sans causes, 

Quand je vous menais au, Prado diner, 

Vous etiez 'jolie au point que les roses 
Me faisaient I’effet de se retourner. 

« 

Je les entendais dire : Est-elle belle I 
Comme elle sent bon I quels cheveux k flots ! 

Sous son mantelet .elle cache une aile; 

Son bonnet charmant est k peine ddos. 

Jerrais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple. 

Les passants croyaient que Tamour charme 
Avait mari6, dans notre heureux couple, 

Le doux mois d’avril au beau mois de mai. 

Nous vivions caches, content^ portc close, 

D^vorant Tamour, bon e^fendu ;

pathetic charm to these rhymes, murmured in a low tone in the 
twilight by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a sweet poet. 

Meanwhile they had lighted a lamp at the little barricade, and 
at the large one, one of those wax torches which are,, seen on Mardi 
Gras in front of the waggons loaded with masks, which are going 
to the Comtille. These torches, we have seen, came from the Fau- 
bourg Saint Antoine. 

The torch had been placed in a kind of cage, closed in with pav- 
ing-stones on three sides, to shelter it from the wind, and disposed 
in such a manner that all the light fell upon the flag. The street and 
the barricade remained plunged in obscurity, and nothing could be 
seen but the red flag, fearfully lighted up, as if by an enormous dark 
lantern. 

This light gave to the scarlet of the flag an indescribably terrible 
purple. 


VII 

THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES 

It was now quite night, nothing came. There were only confused 
sounds, and at intervals volleys of musketry ; but rare, ill-sustained, 
and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged, was a sign that 
the government was taking its time, and massing its forces. These 
fifty men were awaiting sixty thousand. 

Enjolras felt himself possessed by that impatience which seizes 
strong souls on the threshold of formidable events. He went to find 
Gavroche who had set himself to making cartridges in the basement 
room by the doubtful light of two candles placed upon the counter 
through precaution on account of the powder scattered over the 
tables. These two candles threw no rays outside. The insurgents 
moreover had taken care not to have any lights in the upper stories. 

Gavroche at this moment was very much engaged, not exactly 
with his cartridges. 

The man from the Rue des Billettes had just entered the basement 
room and had taken a seat at the table which was least lighted. An 
infantry musket of large model had fallen to his lot, and he held 
it between his knees. Gavroche hitherto, distracted by a hundred 
'^amusing'* things, had not even seen this man. 

When he came in, Gavroche mechanically followed him with his 

eyes, admiring his musket, then, suddenly, when the man had sat 

down, the gamin arose. Had any one watched this man up to this 

time, he would have seen him observe everything in the barricade 

and in the band of insurgents with a singular attention ; but since 

he had come into the room, he had fallen into a kind of meditation

themselves upon him. 

Tlien Ihtjolras approached the man and asked liini : 

“W'hn are you ?“ 

At this altrupt quMtion, the man gave a start. Me looked straight 
to the iKiftom t)f Knjo!ras‘ frank eye and a|&gt;|«rared to catch his 
iltought. Me smiled with a smile which, of all things in the world,

was the most disdainful, the most energetic, and the most resolute, 
and answered with a haughty gravity : 

‘‘I see how it is Well, yes 

‘'You are a spy ?” 

“I am an officer of the government/’ 

“Your name is?” 

“Javert.” 

Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In a twinkling, before Ja- 
vert had had time to turn around, he was collared, thrown down, 
bound, searched. 

They found upon him a little round card framed between two 
glasses, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved with 
this legend : Surveillance et vig^ilance, and on the other side this en- 
dorsement: Javert, inspector of police, aged fifty-two, and the 
signature of the prefect of police of the time, M. Gisquet. 

He had besides his watch and his purse, which contained a few 
gold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch, 
at the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope, 
which Enjolras opened, and on which he read these six lines, written 
by the prefect’s own hand. 

“As soon as his p6litical mission is fulfilled. Inspector Javert 
will ascertain, by a special examination, whether it be true that male- 
factors have resorts on the slope of the right bank of the Seine, near 
the bridge of Jena.” 

The search finished, they raised Javert, tied his arms behind his 
back, fastened him in the middle of the basement-room to that cele- 
brated post which had formerly given its name to the wine-shop. 

Gavroche, who had witnessed the whole scene and approved the 
whole l 3 y silent nods of his head, approached Javert and said to him : 

“The mouse has caught the cat.” . , 

All this was executed so rapidly that it was finished as soon as it 
was perceived about the wine-shop. Javert had not uttered a cryc 
Seeing Javert tied to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Gombe- 
ferre, and the men scattered about the two barricades, ran in. 

Javert, backed up against the post, and so surrounded with ropes 
that he could' make no movement, held up his head with the intrepid 
serenity of the man who has never lied. 

“It is a spy,” said Enjolras. 

And turning towards Javert : 

“You will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken. 

Javert replied in his most imperious tone: 

“Why not immediately ?” 

“We are economising powder.” 

“Then do it with a knife.” 

'"Spy,” said the handsome Enjolras, “we are judges, not assas* 
fins.”

Then he seizes a musket and begins to beat the door with the butt. 
It was an old alley door, arched, low, narrow, solid, entirely of oak, 
lined on the inside with sheet-iron and with iron braces, a genuine 
postern of a bastille. The blows made the house tremble, but did not 
shake the door. 

Nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were alarmed, for 
they finally saw a little square window on the third story light up 
and open, and there appeared at this window a candle, and the pious 
and frightened face of a grey-haired goodman who was the porter* 

The man who was knocking, stopped. 

“Messieurs,” asked the porter, “what do you wish?” 

“Open!” said Le Cabuc. 

“Messieurs, that cannot be.” 

“Open, I tell you!” 

“Impossible, messieurs !” 

Le Cabuc took his musket and aimed at the porter’s head ; but as 
he was below, and it was very dark, the porter did not see him. 

“Yes, or no, will you open?” 

“No, messieurs !” 

“You say no?” 

“I say no, my good — ” 

The porter did not finish. The musket went off ; the ball entered 
under his chin and passed out at the back of the neck, passing through 
the jugular. The old man sank down without a sigh. The candle fell 
and was extinguished, and nothing could now be seen but an im- 
movable head lying on the edge of the window, and a little whitish 
smoke floating towards the roof. 

“That’s it !” said Le Cabuc, letting the butt of his musket drop 
on the pavement. ’ . 

Hardly had he uttered these words when he felt a hand pounce 
upon his shoulder with the weight of an eagle’s talons, and heard 
a voice which said to him : 

“On your knees.” . ^ ^ - 

The murderer turned and saw before him the white cold face of 
Enjolras. Eiijolras had a pistol in his hand. ■ 

At the explosion, he had come up. 

He had grasped with his left hand Le Cabuc’s collar, blouse, shirty 
and suspenders. . , 

“On your knees,” repeated he. 

And with a majestic movement the slender young man of twenty 
bent the broad-shouldered and robust porter like a reed and made 
him kneel in the mud. Le Cabuc tried to resist, but he seemed to have 
been seized by a superhuman grasp. , 

Pale, his neck bare, his hair flying, Enjolras, with his woman’s 
face, had at that moment an inexpressible something of the ancient 
Themis. His distended nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his im-

placable Greek profile that expression ut wrall^ and that expression 
of chastity which frotii the point of view ot; the ancient world be- 
longed to jnslice. ^ 

The whole barricatle ran up. then all ranged in a circle at a dis- 
tance, feeling that it was inipossihle to utter a word in presence of 
the act which they wt'rt* alumt to wit!u*ss, 

Le Calnic, vaiu|tiishe&lt;h no longer attetn])ted to defend himself, 
but trenil)led in every limb. ICujolras let go of him and took out his 
watch. 

‘‘Collect yotir ilionghts/’ sai&lt;l he. “ih^ay or think. You have one 
minute/* 

“rurdon!** niunnured the nmnlenng tlum Ite liowed his head and 
mumbled some inarticulate oaths,^ 

h'njolras did not take his eyes tdl his watch : he let the inimite pass, 
iheu 1 k! put his watcli iKick into his fola 11ns dune, he took Le Cabuc, 
who was writhing against his knees^and howling, by the hair, and 
;)!aced the inuz/.h* cd' Ins pisod at his ear. I^lany of those intrepid 
nneig wlio had so traru|tn!ly entered ttpt&gt;it the most terrible of enter- 
pris(*s, turned away their heads. 

They lu*aril the ex]itosiom tin* assassin fell face forward on the 
pavement, and Mijulras straightened up and cast about him his look 
determined and severe, 

11n*n lie pushed the body away with his foot, and said : 

“Throw that mitside/* 

Three men lifted the body of the wretch, which was quivering 
with the last luechnnical eou\mlsit»ns of the life tliat had flown, and 
threw it over t!ie small barricade into the little Rue Mondetour. 

Eitjolras hat! naiiaiited ilmughtful. Shadow, mysterious and

Fraternity. This is not a moment to pronounce the word love. No 
matter, I pronounce it^ and I glorify it. Love, thine is the future. 
Death, I use thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, there shall be in the future 
neither darkness nor thunderbolts ; neither ferocious ignorance nor 
blood for blood. As Satan shall be no more, so Michael shall be no 
more. In the future no man shall slay his fellow, the earth shall be 
radiant, the human race shall love. It will come, citizens, that day 
when all shall be concord, harmony, light, joy, and life ; it will come, 
and it is that it may come that we are going to die.'" 

Enjolras was silent. His virgin lips closed ; and he remained some 
time standing on the spot where he had spilled blood, in marble im- 
mobility. His fixed eye made all about him speak low. 

Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre silently grasped hands, and, lean- 
ing upon one another in the corner of the barricade, considered, 
with an admiration not unmingled with compassion, this severe 
young man, executioner and priest, luminous like the crystal, and 
rock also. 

Let us say right here that later, after the action, when the corpses 
were carried to the Morgue and searched, there was a police officer's 
card found on Le Cabuc. The author of this book had in his own 
hands, in 1848, the special report made on that subject to the pre- 
fect of police in 1832. 

Let us add that, if we are to believe a police tradition, strange, but 
probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The fact is, that 
after the death of Le Cabuc, nothing more was heard of Claquesous. 
Claquesous left no trace on his disappearance, he would seem to have 
been amalgamated with the invisible. His life had been darkness, his 
end was night. 

The whole insurgent group were still under the emotion of this 
tragic trial, so quickly instituted and so quickly terminated, when 
Courfeyrac again saw in the barricade the small young man who in 
the morning had called at his house for Marius. 

This boy, who had a bold and reckless air, had come at night i ) 
rejoin the insurgents.

He liegan to walk raiiidly. It Iwpiiene&lt;l that lie was armed, having 
Javerl 's pi.siols with him. 

The young man whom he thought he had seen was lost from his 
eyes in the .streets. 

ilanns, who had left the Rue I’hunet hv the hotilevard, crossed 
the Hs|»lanade and the Hridgeof the Inv.dides, the Champs Elysdes, 
the I'laee I.nt}is X and entererl the R’ne th* Rivoli. Tlie .stores were 
open, the gas wits hnrning muler the arche.s, women were buying 
in the shop, jifoide wt‘re taking ices at the Cafe Latter, they were 
eating little cake.s at the IViiisscrie .Anglaise. However, a few post 
chaises were .setting o(T at a gallop from the Hotel de.s Princes and 
the Hotel Meiiriee.

Marins followed the Rue St. Hottori. As he receded from the 
Palais Royal, there were fewer lighted windows; the shops were 
entirely closed, nobody was chatting in the doors, the street grew 
gloomy, and at the same time the Uirong grew dense. For the pas^rs

now Were a throng. Nobody was seen to speak in this throng, and 
still there came from it a deep and dull hum. 

Towards the Fontaine de TArbre Sec, there were ‘‘gatherings, 
•immovable and sombre groups, which, among the comers and goers, 
were like stones in the middle of a running stream. 

At the entrance of the Rue des Prouvaires, the throng no longer 
moved. It was a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impene- 
trable block of people, heaped together and talking in whispers. 
Black coats and round hats had almost disappeared. Frocks, blouses, 
caps, bristly and dirty faces. This multitude undulated confusedly 
in the misty night. Its whispering had the harsh sound of a roar. 
Although nobody was walking, a trampling was heard in the mud. 
Beyond this dense mass, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prou- 
vaires, and in the prolongation of the Rue Saint Honore, there was 
not a single window in which a candle was burning. In those streets 
the files of the lamps were seen stretching away solitary and de- 
creasing. The lamps of that day resembled great red stars hanging 
from ropes, and threw a shadow on the pavement which had the 
form of a large spider. These streets were not empty. Muskets could 
be distinguished in stacks, bayonets moving and troops bivouacking. 
The curious did not pass this bound. There circulation ceased. There 
the multitude ended and the army began. 

Marius willed with the will of a man who no longer hopes. He 
had been called, he must go. He found means to pass through the 
multitude, and to pass through the bivouac of the troops, he avoided 
the patrols, evaded the sentinels. He made a detour, reached the 
Rue de Bethisy, and made his way towards the markets. At the 
corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais the lamps ended. 

After having crossed the belt of the multitude and passed the 
fringe of troops, he found himself in the midst of something terrible. 
Not a passer more, not a soldiei*, not a light ; nobody. SoHtude, si-, 
lence, night ; a mysterious chill which seized upon him. To enter a 
street was to enter a cellar. 

Fie continued to advance. “ . 

He took a few steps. Somebody passed near him running. Was it 
a man ? a woman ? were there sever^ ? He could not have told. It had 
passed and had vanished. 

By a circuitous route, he came to a little street which he judged to 
be the Rue de la Poterie ; about the middle of this alley he ran against 
some obstacle. He put out his hands". It was an overtujrned cart; his 
foot recognised puddles of water, mud-holes, paving-stones, scat- 
tered and heaped up. A barricade had been planned there and aban- 
doned. He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other 
side of the obstruction. He walked vepr near the posts and guided 
himself by the walls of the houses- A^ little beyond the barricade, he 
seemed to catch a glimpse of something white in front of him. He

broken and fantastic lines, outlines of singular constructions, some- 
thing like ghostly gleams, coming and going among ruins; these 
were the barricades. The rest was a lake of obscurity, misty, h.eavy, 
funereal, above which rose, motionless and dismal silhouettes, the 
tower Saint Jacques, the church Saint Merry, and two or three others 
of those great buildings of which man makes giants and of which 
night makes phantoms. 

All about this deserted and disquieted labyrinth, in the quartiers 
where the circulation of Paris was not stopped, and where a few 
rare lamps shone out,’ the aerial observer might have distinguished 
the metallic scintillation of s^feres and bayonets, the sullen rumbling 
of artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions augmenting from 
moment to moment; a formidable girdle which was tightening and 
slowly closing about the aneute. 

The invested quartier was now only a sort of monstrous cavern ; 
everything in it appeared to be sleeping or motionless, and, as we 
have just seen, none of the streets on which you might have entered, 
offered anything but darkness. 

A savage darkness, full of snares, full of unknown and formid- 
able encounters, where it was fearful to penetrate and appalling to 
stay, where those who entered shuddered before those who were 
awaiting them, where those who waited trembled before those who 
were to come. Invisible combatants intrenched at every street-cor- 
ner ; the grave hidden in ambush in the thickness of the night. It was 
finished. No other light to be hoped for there henceforth save the 
flash of musketry, no other meeting save the sudden and rapid ap- 
parition of death. Where? how? when? nobody knew; but it was 
certain and inevitable. There, in that place marked out for the con- 
test, the government and the insurrection, the National Guard and 
the popular societies, the bourgeoisie and the emeute were to grope 
their way. For those as for these, the necessity was the same. To 
leave that place slain or victors, the only possible issue henceforth. 
A situation so extreme, an obscurity so overpowering, that the most 
timid felt themselves filled with resolution and the Boldest with 
terror. 

Moreover, on both sides, fury, rancour, equal determination. For 
those to advance was to die, and nobody thought of retreat; for 
those to stay was to die, and nobody thought of flight. 

All must be decided on the morrow, the triumph must be on this 
side or on that, the insurrection must be a revolution or a blunder. 
The government understood it as well as the factions; the least 
bourgeois felt it. Hence a feeling of anguish which mingled with 
the impenetrable darkness of this quartier where all was to be de- 
cided ; hence a redoubling of anxiety about this silence whence a 
catastrophe was to issue. But one sound could be heard, a sound 
heart-rending as a death rattle, menacing as a malediction, the tocsin

MARim had arrived at the maikrts, 

There nil was more calm, niorr mIisciii c, and more motionless still 
that! in llte neighlioHring sitreis, &lt; ine would have said that the icy 
jieace of the grave liatl come forth from the earth and spread over 
the sky. 

A red glare, however, rnt out Mjion this dark lackgnntnd the high 
roofs of the hornsrs which liarrrd the Une ile l,a t hanvrerie on the 
sidctow.'irds Saint iMisiache. It was the rrilrciion of the torch which 
was blazing in the Iwrricade of t ••rinih. .Marins directed his steps 
towards this glare. It led him to the Hi-d .Market, and he dimly saw 
the «l:irk month of the Hue des Prechenrs, Me eiiiereti it. The vidette 
of the insnrgenis who was on guard at the other end did not perceive 
him. He felt that he wa.s very near what he had come to seek, and 
he walked n|«&gt;n tiptoe. He r«iclie«l in this way the ellmw of that 
ahort end of the Kite Mondi^our, which was, as we renwmber, the 
only communiratinn ivrescrvcd by Mnjolraa with the outside. Round 
the comer of the last tamm! on his left, cant ionsly advancing his hea4 
he todted into this end of the Rue Monddtour. 

A Htth) beyond the black comer of the alley and the Roe de ki 



SAINT DENIS 94S 

Chanvrerie, which threw a broad shadow, in which he was himself 
buried, he perceived a light upon the pavement, a portion of the 
wine-shop, and behind, a lamp twinkling in a kind of shapeless wall, 
and men crouching down with muskets on their knees. All this was 
within twenty yards of him. It was the interior of the barricade. 

The houses on the right of the alley hid from him the, rest of the 
wine-shop, the great barricade, and the flag. 

Marius had but one step more to take. 

Then the unhappy young man sat down upon a stone, folded his 
arms, and thought of his father. 

He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy who had been so 
brave a soldier, who had defended the frontier of France under the 
republic, and reached the frontier of Asia under the emperor, who 
had seen Genoa, Alessandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dres- 
den, Berlin, Moscow, who had left upon every field of victory in 
Europe drops of that same blood which he, Marius, had in his viens, 
who had grown grey before his time in discipline and in command, 
who had lived with his sword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his 
breast, his cockade blackened by powder, his forehead wrinkled by 
the cap, in the barracks, in the camp, in the bivouac, in the ambulance, 
and who after twenty years had returned from the great wars with 
his cheek scarred, his face smiling, simple, tranquil, admirable, pure 
as a child, having done everything for France and nothing against 
her. 

He said to himself that his day had come to him also, that his hour 
had at last struck, that after his father, he also was to be brave, 
intrepid, bold, to run amidst bullets, to bare his breast to the 
bayonets, to pour out his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that 
he was to wage war in his turn and to enter upon the field of battle, 
and that that field of battle upon which he was about to enter, was 
the street, and that war which he was about to wage, was civil war f 

Pie saw civil war yawning like an abyss before him, and that in it 
he was to fall. 

Then he shuddered. 

Pie thought of that sword of his father which his grandfather had 
sold to a junk-shop, and which he himself had so painfully regretted. 
He said to himself that it was well that that chaste and valiant sword 
had escaped from him, and gone off in anger into the darkness ; that 
if it had fled thus, it was because it was intelligent and because it 
foresaw the future ; because it foreboded the emeute, the war of 
the gutters, the war of the pavements, the firing from cellar win- 
dows, blows given and received from behind ; because, coming from 
Marengo and Friedland, it would not go to the Rue de la Chanvrerie, 
because after what it had done with the father, it would not do this 
with the son ! He said to himself that if that sword were there, if. 
having received it from the bedside of his dead father, he had dar^d 



946 1- K S M ! S K K A U L !•: S 

to take it and Imntj it away for this iiiKlit combat between French- 
men at the street corners, most surely it. woiibl have burned hi" 
Imnds, and flamed before him like the swonl of tlie angel! He said 
to himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and tliat it had 
tlisapiH!ared, that it was well, tjiat it was jtisi, that bis grandfather 
had been the true gnrirdian of his father’s gbiry, and that it was 
better that the colontd’s swonl had been yried at’ auction, sold to a 
dealer, thrown .anumg old iron, than tlait it should be used to-day to 
pierce the side of tbeeoimtry. 

And then be began to weep bitterly. 

It was hiirrible. l!nt what could be d»t? Live without Cosette he 
could not. .‘since she had gone away, he must surely die. Had he not 
given her his word of honour that he shoid*! die? She had gone away 
knowing that ; therefore it pleaseil her that M.arius should die. And 
then it was clear that site iio longer joved him. since she Lid' gone 
away thus, without nolin iug him. without a word, without a letter 
anti she ktiew his aildre^s! U'hat use in life anti why live longer? 
And then, imleein tt&gt; luive come st» f.ir, ami to recoil! to have ap- 
prufiched the danger. :md to llee!_tt» have come iind looked into the 
iKtrricaiie, and to slink .iwtiy ! to slink .ivvay all tremhling, s.iying: “in 
fact, 1 have had etiotigli of tliis, I have .seen, that is sulllcient, it is 
civil war, i ;uii goin.g away !" l o ahamlon his friemls who were ex- 
pecting him! who perhaps hml need ttf him! who were a handful 
against an army ! ‘lo fait iu all lhiut;s at the same time, in his love, 
his frieiiilship, liis wor*i I 'I'o give bis pollnstnery the pretext of pa- 
triotism! But Ibis was tmjjossible. ami if bis fatbtM-'sgho.st were there 
in the shadow .ind saw him recoil, b,* wtnibl strike liim with the flat 
of his sword and cry to him : " \»ivan»'e. cowarii !" 

A prey to the sw.iying of his thou,i;his, he bowed his head. 

Suddenly he.siraiglUeiieil up. A sort of splendid rectification was 
wrought iii his spirit, Tltere was au expaiistou of thought fitted to 
the coiifiuity of the tomb ; to be near «leath makes us .see the truth. 
The vision of the act u|Hin which he felt himself, j&gt;erhaps on the 
p{&gt;int of euteriiig, iijipe.ircd to him uo lituger lauteiilahle, but superb, 
The mr of the street w.is smldeuly traiisligured bv some indescrib- 
able interior throe of tbc soul, liefore the eye of Ids mind. All the 
tumultuous internigatiun jjoints »«f his reverie througed upon him, 
but without troubling itim. Me left none without au answer. 

Let us see, why should hi.s fallier Iw iniligniinl ? are there not 
cases when insurrection rises to the dignity of duty? what would 
there ijc then Ijcliitling to the stm of Colonel Hontmcrcy in the im- 
pending combat ? it is no longer Montmirail or Champautert; it is 
something else. It is no longer a &lt;iucsiirin of a .sacred territory, but 
of a holy idea, The country laments, so be it ; but humanity applauds, 
Besides is it true that the countre mourns ? France bleeds, but liberty 
smiles: wad before the smile of liberty, France forgets her wound. 



SAINTDENIS 947 

And then, looking at the matter from a still higher stand, why do men 
talk of c*ivil war ? 

Civil war ? What does this mean ? Is there any foreign war ? Is 
not every war between men, war between brothers ? War is modified 
only by its aim. There is neither foreign war, nor civil war; there is 
only unjust war and j'ust war. Until the day when the great human 
concordat shall be concluded, war, that at least which is the struggle 
Txri hurrying future against the lingering past, may be necessary. 
What reproach can be brought against such war ! War becomes 
shcime, the swoid becomes a dagger, only when it assassinates right, 
piogiess, leasbn, civilisation, truth. Then, civil war or foreign war, 
it is inicjuitous ; its name is crime. Outside of that holy thing, jus- 
tice, by what right does one form of war despise another? by what 
right does the sword of Washington disown the pike of Camille 
Desmoulins? Leonidas against the foreigner, Timoleon against the 
tyrant, which is the greater ? one is the defender, the other is the 
liberator. Shall we brand, without troubling ourselves with the ob- 
ject, every resort to arms in the interior of a city ? then mark with 
infamy Brutus, Marcel, Arnold of Blankenheim, Coligny. War of 
the thickets ? war of the streets ? Why not ? it was the war of Am- 
biorix, of Artaveld, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought 
against Rome, Artaveld against France, Marnix against Spain, Pela- 
gius against the Moors ; all against the foreigner. Well, monarchy 
is the foreigner; oppression is the foreigner; divine 'right is the 
foreigner. Despotism violator the moral frontier, as invasion violates 
the geographical frontier. To drive out the tyrant or to drive out 
the Iinglish is, in either case, to retake your territory. There conies 
an hour when protest no longer suffices ; after philosophy there must 
be action ; the strong hand finishes what the idea has planned ; 
Prometheus Bound begins, Aristogeiton completes ; the Encyclo- 
pedic enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them. After 
.^schylus, ■ Thrasybulus ; after Diderot, Danton. The multitudes 
have a tendency to accept a master. Their mass deposits apathy. A 
mob easily totalises itself into obedience-. Men must be aroused, 
pushed, shocked by the very benefits of their deliverance, their eyes 
wounded with the truth, light thrown them in terrible handfuls. 
They should be blinded a little for their own safety; this dazzling 
wakens them. Hence the necessity for tocsins and for wars. Great 
warriors must arise, illuminate the nations by boldness, and shake 
free this sad humanity which is covered with shadow by divine right. 
Caesarean glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power, and abso- 
lute dominion, a mob stupidly occupied with gazing, in their twilight 
splendour, at these gloomy triumphs of the night. Down with the 
tyrant ! But what ? of whom do you speak ? do you call Louis Philippe 
the tyrant? no ; no more than Louis XVI. They are both what his-- 
tory is accustomed to call good kings ; but principles cannot be par

BOOK FOURTEENTH 
THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR 
I 

THE FLAG : FIRST ACT 

Nothing came yet. The clock of Saint Merry had struck ten. En- 
jolras and Combeferre had sat down, carbine in hand, near the 
opening of the great barricade. They were not talking, they were 
listening ; seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound 
of a march. 

Suddenly, in the midst of this dismal calm, a clear, young, cheer- 
ful voice, which seemed to come from the Rue Saint Denis, arose 
and began ‘to sing distinctly to the old popular air, Au clair de la 
lune, these lines which ended in a sort of cry similar to the crow of 
acock: 

Mon nez est en lartnes, 

Mon ami ©ugeaud, 

Pret-moi tes, gendarmes 
Pour leur dire un mot. 

Encapote bleue, 

La poule au shako, 

'Voici la banlieuel 
Co“CocoricoP 

They grasped each other by the hand : 

^*It is Gavroche,” said En jolras. 

^'He is warning us,’* said Combeferre. 

A headlong run startled the empty street ; they saw a creature 
nimbler than clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded 
into the barricade all breathless, saying : 

^‘My musket ! Here they are.** 

* My nose is in tears, 

My good friend Bugeaud, 

Just lend me your spears 
To tell them my woe. 

In blue cassimere, 

And feathered shako. 

The banlieue is here! 

Co-cocoricol 

949 



950 ■ LESMISEKABLES 

An electric thrill ran through the whole liarricade, and a moving 
of hands was heard, feeling for tlieir muskets. ^ 

“Do you want niy carbine?” said Enjolras to the gamin. 

“I want the big musket,” answered Gavroche. 

And he took Javert’s musket. 

Two sentinels had been clriven back, and had come in almost at the 
tame time as Gavroche. They were the sentinel from the end of the 
’street, and the videttc from la Petite Truanderic. The vidette in the 
little Rue des Precheurs remained at his post, which indicated that 
nothing was coming from the direction of the bridges and the mar- 
kets. 

The Rue do la Chanvrerie, in wdiich a few paving-stones were 
dimly visilde by the reilection of the light which was"” thrown upon 
the flag, offered to the insurgents the appearance of a great black 
porch opening into a cloud of smoke. 

Every man had t:iken bis post for the combat. 

Forty-thr&lt;?e insurgents, anuing them Enjolras, Combeferre, Cour- 
feyrac, Rossuet, Joly, Hahorel, ainl Gavroche, were on their knees 
in the great barricade, their heads even with the crest of the wall 
the liarrds of their muskets :uui their carbines pointed over the 
paving-stones as through loophidcs, watchful, silent, ready to fire. 
Six’, commanded by j'Vuilly, were stationed with their muskets at 
their shoulders, in the windows of the two upper .stories of Corinth. 

A few moments more elapsed, then a .sound of steps, measured^ 
heavy, immcrous, was distinctly heard from the direction of Saint 
I-eti. Thi.s .sound, at first faint, (hen distinct, then heavy and sonor- 
ous, approached slowly, witliout halt, without interruption, with a 
tranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing hut this could be heard It 
was at once the silence and the sound tif tlic statue of the Com- 
mander, Init this stony tread w.as so indi'.scrihahly enormous and so 
mult iplex, that it calle&lt;l up at the same time llie iilea of a throng and 
of a spectre. You woukniave thought you heard the .stride of the 
fearftil .statue r.egiun. Thi.s treail approached; it approached still 
nearer, and stopptl. They setimed to hear at the end of the street 
the hrpthing of many men. 'fhey .saw nothing, however, only 
they discovered at the very ent!, in tliat dense obscurity, a multi- 
tude of metallic threatls, as fine as needles nn&lt;! almost imperceptible, 
which moved alioiU like tlwisc imleserihahle phosphoric networks 
which we pereeive under otir closed eyelids at the moment of going 
to sleep, in the first mists of slumber, 'fhey were bayonets and mus- 
ket barrels dimly lighted up by the distant reflection of the torch. 

There was .still a pause, as if on both sides they were awaiting. 
Suddenly, from the depth of that shadow, a voice, so much the more 
ominous, because nolKwIy could be seen, and because it seemed as if 
it were the olsscurity itself which was speaking, cried ; 

"Who is there?” 



SAINT DENIS 951 

At the same time they heard the click of the levelled muskets. 

Enjolras answered in a lofty and ringing tone : 

'Trench Revolution V 

'Tire V said the voice. 

A flash empurpled all the fagades on the street, as if the door of 
a furnace were opened and suddenly closed. 

A fearful explosion burst over the barricade. The red flag fell. 
The volley had been so heavy and so dense that it had cut the staff, 
that is to say, the very point of the pole of the omnibus. Some balls, 
which ricocheted from the cornices of the houses, entered the barri- 
cade and wounded several men. 

The impression produced by this first charge was freezing. The 
attack was impetuous, and such as to make the boldest ponder. It 
was evident that they had to do with a whole regiment at least. 

• "Comrades, cried Courfeyrac, "don’t waste the powder. Let us 
v/ait to reply till they come into the street.” 

"And first of all,” said Enjolras, "let us hoist the flag again!” 

He picked up the flag which had fallen just at his feet. 

, They heard from without the rattling of the ramrods in the mus- 
kets : the troops were reloading. 

Enjolras continued : 

"Who is there here who has courage ? who replants the flag on 
the barricade ?” 

Nobody answered. To mount the barricade at the moment when 
without doubt it was aimed at anew, was simply death. The bravest 
hesitates to sentence himself, Enjolras himself felt a shudder. He 
repeated : 

"Nobody volunteers!” 

n 


THE flag: second act 

Singe they had arrived at Corinth and had commenced building the 
barricade, hardly any attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. 
M. Mabeuf, however, had not left the company. He had entered 
the ground floor of the wine-shop and sat down behind the counter. 
There he had been, so to speak, annihilated in himself. He no longer 
seemed to look or to think. Courfeyrac and others had accosted him 
two or three times, warning him of the danger, entreating him to 
withdraw, but he had not appeared to hear them. When nobody was 
speaking to him, his lips moved as if he were answering somebody, 
and as soon as anybody addressed a word to him, his lips became still 
and his eyes lost all appearance of life. Some hours before the bar- 
ricade was attacked, he had taken a position which he had not left 
since, his hands upon his knees and his head bent forward as if he 
were looking into an aby{ss. Nothing had been able tp,^# him"

When everybody had ffonc to take his |&gt;la&lt;-e for the combat, there 
remained in the ixisement room only Javert tied to the post, an ’insur- 
gent with drawn salire watt-hing JaveH:, and he, Mabeuf. At the

to elintb .slowly njt Ihe siairway of p;tv iiig-siiines httill into the barri- 
cade. It was stt gltrtfttiy and so gr;iitt! dun .all ahont him cried: “Hats 
olT !” Al eaelt step it was ft ig.hi iitl ; his wliiut hair, his decrepit face, 
his kirgt^ I'ufeiieutl lahl aitil wiinlded, his Imllow eyes, his (|uiverii^ 
aitd open iiiunili, his old .'inti raising the red hanner, surged up out 
ttf die .shadow :tiid gifw grand in the hluody light of Ihe torch, and 
they .seemed to see ihe gliusi of ''U rising out of die earth, the flag 
of ierror in ils liaiul. 

When he was on the fop of the last step, when this tremhling and 
terriide phantom, standing npun iltai niuinid of nthhish before twelve 
itninlreii iiivisilde muskets, ruHe up, in the face of death and as if lie 
were stronger titan it, the whole harric.ule lutd in the darkness a 
supernamnil ant! colos&gt;al iippearant e. 

There was one of those stUmces which occur tinly in pre,senceof 
prntiifjies. 

In the midst of litis silence the old man wavetl the. red flag and 
cried : &gt; 

"{ 'hv /« f 1 iv,' hi ir^iihthiiu-! fraieriiity ! etiuality ! and 

rlealh!” . ’ , . 

Tliey heard from the barricade a hnv .‘iii»l rapitl tiintlering like the 
nmririHr ttf a hnrried priesi tlispalching a jirayer. It was probably 
the cornmissai V of police who was making die legal siiinmons at the

*'l'm h rej^HblUiiu'!" 



SAINT DENIS 

*‘Fire !” said the voice. 

A second discharge, like a shower of grape, beat against the bar*v 
ricade. 

The old man fell upon his knees, then rose up, let the flag drop, 
and fell backwards upon the pavement within, like a log, at full 
length with his arms crossed. 

Streams of blood ran from beneath him. His old face, pale and 
sad, seemed to behold the sky. 

One of those emotions superior to man, which make us forget even 
to defend ourselves, seized the insurgents, and they approached the 
corpse with a respectful dismay. 

‘'What men these regicides are !” said Enjolras. 

Courfeyrac bent over to Enjolras’ ear. 

“This is only for you, and I don’t wish to diminish the enthus- 
iasm. But he -was anything but a regicide. I knew him. His name 
was Father Mabeuf. I don’t know, what ailed him to-day. But he 
was a brave blockhead. Just look at his head.” 

“Blockhead and Brutus heart/’ answered Enjolras. 

Then he raised his voice : 

“Citizens ! This is the example which the old give to the young. 
We hesitated, he came ! we fell back, he advanced ! Behold what those 
who tremble with old age teach those who tremble with fear ! This 
patriarch is august in the sight of the country. He has had a long 
life and a magnificent death! Now let us protect his corpse, let ev- 
ery one defend this old man dead as he would defend his father liv- 
ing, and let his presence among us make the barricade impregnable !” 

A murmur of gloomy and determined adhesion followed these 
words. 

Enjolras stooped down, raised the old man’s head, and timidly 
kissed him on the forehead, then separating his arms, and handling 
the dead with a tender care, as if he feared to hurt him, he took off 
his coat, showed the bleeding holes to all, and said : 

“There now is our flag.” 


Ill 

GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT EN JOLRAS’ CARBINE 

They threw a long black shawl belonging to the widow Hucheloup 
.over Father Mabeuf. Six men made a barrow of their muskets, they 
jaid the corpse upon it, and they bore it, bareheaded, with solemn 
^lowness, to the large table in the basement room. 

These men, completely absorbed in the grave and sacred thing 
•Yrhich they were doing, no longer thought of the perilous situation 
in which they were. 

When the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassible, En- 
jolras said to the spy :

SAINT DENIS 9SS 

At the shots, at the cries of the wounded Guards, the assailants 
had scaled the intrenchment, upon the summit of which could now 
be seen thronging Municipal Guards, soldiers of the Line, National 
Guards of the banlieue, musket in hand. They already covered more 
than two-thirds of the wall, but they did not leap into the inclosure ; 
they seemed to hesitate, fearing some snare. They looked into the 
obscure barricade as one would look into a den of lions. The light of 
the torch only lighted up their bayonets, their bearskin caps, and 
the upper part of their anxious and angry faces. 

^ Marius had now no arms, he had thrown away his discharged 
pistols, but he had noticed the keg of powder in the basement room 
near the door. 

As he turned half round, looking in that direction, a soldier aimed 
at him. At the moment the soldier aimed at Marius, a hand was laid 
upon the muzzle of the musket, and stopped it. It was somebody who 
had sprung forward, the young working-man with velvet pantaloons. 
The shot went off, passed through the hand, and perhaps also 
through the working-man, for he fell, but the ball did not reach 
Marius. All this in the smoke, rather guessed than seen. Marius, who 
was entering the basement room, hardly noticed it. Still he had 
caught a dim glimpse of that musket directed at him, and that hand 
which had stopped it, and he had heard the shot. But in moments 
like that the things which we see, waver and rush headlong, and we 
stop for nothing. We feel ourselves vaguely pushed towards still 
deeper shadow, and all is cloud. 

The insurgents, surprised, but not dismayed, had rallied. EnjoL 
ras had cried : ‘‘Wait ! don’t fire at random !” In the first confusion, 
in fact, they might hit one another. Most of them had gone up to the 
window of the second story and to the dormer windows, whence they 
commanded the assailants. The most determined, with Enjolras, 
Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, and Combeferre, had haughtily placed 
their backs to the houses in the rear, openly facing the ranks of 
soldiers and guards which crowded the barricade. 

All this was accomplished without precipitation, with that strange 
and threatening gravity which precedes melees. On both sides they 
were taking aim, the muzzles of the guns almost touching ; they were 
so near that they could talk with each other in an ordinary tone. Just 
as the spark was about to fly, an officer in a gorget and with huge 
epaulets, extended his sword and said : 

“Take aim!” 

“Fire 1” said Enjolras. , 

The two explosions were sibiultaneous, and everything disap- 
peared in the smoke. 

A stinging and stifling smoke amid which writhed, with dull and 
feeble groans; the wounded and the dying.^ 

When the smoke cleared away, on both sides the combatants were

seen, thinned out, hut still in the snine jilru'cs, ami reloadine thpiV 

pieces in silence. _ , ^ ^ 

Suddenly, a tliumlerin;4' voice was heard, crying: 

“Begone, or I’ll blow up the harricude!" 

All turned in tlie direction whence the voice came. 

Maritis had entered the ha.-ieni.ait room, .and had taken the keg of 
powder, tlien he had pronted hy ilie smoke and the kind of obscure 
fog which fdled the iiilreitelted im li,iNurc, to glide along the barricade 
as far as that cage of iiaviiig-sinnes in whii-li the torch was fixed.

the pile of paving stone-, upon the keg, which ,st(na‘ it in, with a sort

Marins upon this harriiaade, after the oelogenari.an, was the vision 
of the young revolnlittii .after the app;trjtioii iif the old. 

“Blow np the hanaeade!” said a serge, ant, “and yourself alsoT 

Marins answered : 

“Ami myself also.” 

And he appro, ached the torch to the keg of powder. 

But there was no longer anybody on the wail. Tiie assailants!, leav- 
ing tln-ir ekyad and woinidr'd, fled pell -nrell .and in disorder towards 
the extremity of the street, atid were again lost in the night. It was 
a rout.

were without, and were sweeping him along. It seemed to him that 
he was already at an immense distance from life. His two luminous 
months of joy and of love, terminating abruptly upon this frightful 
precipice, Cosette lost to him, this barricade, M. Mabeuf dying for 
the republic, himself a chief of insurgents, all these things appeared 
a monstrous nightmare. He was obliged to make a mental effort to 
assure himself that all this which surrounded him was real. Marius 
had lived too little as yet to know that nothing is more imminent 
than the impossible, and that what we must always foresee is the 
unforeseen. He was a spectator of his own drama, as of a play which 
one does not comprehend. 

In this mist in which his mind was struggling, he did not recognise 
Javert who, bound to his post, had not moved his head during the 
attack upon the barricade, and who beheld the revolt going on about 
him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge. 
Marius did not even perceive him. 

Meanwhile the assailants made no movement, they were heard 
marching and swarming at the end of the street, but they did not 
venture forward, either that they were awaiting orders, or that 
before rushing anew upon that impregnable redoubt, they were 
awaiting reinforcements. The insurgents had posted sentinels, and 
some who were students in medicine had set about dressing the 
wounded. 

They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the excep- 
tion of two reserved for lint and cartridges, and that on which lay 
Father Mabeuf ; they added them to the barricade, and hadrreplaced 
them in the basement room by the mattresses from the beds of the 
widow Hucheloup, and the servants. Upon these mattresses they 
had laid the wounded ; as for the three poor creatures who lived in 
Corinth, nobody knew what had Become of them. They found them 
at last, however, hidden in the cellar. 

A bitter emotion came to darken their joy over the redeemed 
barricade. 

They called the rdll. One of the insurgents was missing. And who ? 
One of the dearest. One of the most valiant, Jean Prouvaire. They 
sought him among the wounded, he was not there. They sought 
him among the dead, he was not there. He was evidently a prisoner. 

Combeferre said to Enjoli-as : 

“They have our friend; we have their officer. Have you set your 
heart on the death of this spy 

“Yes,’’ said Enjolras ; “but less than on the life of Jean Prou- 
vaix‘e.” 

This passed in the basement room near Javert’s post. 

“Well,” replied Combeferre, “I am going to tie my handker- 
chief to my cane, and go with a flag of truce to offer to give them 
their man for ours.”

“Listen,” said Enjolras, Ids hand tin t 'oinlicferre’s arm. 

There was a significant click infj tif arms at the end of the street 

They heard a manly voice cry 

'‘Vivcla France ! F ive raven ir ! 

They recognized Frotivaire’.s voice. 

There was a fla.sh and an e.'cplosion. 

Silence reigned again. 

“They have killed him.” exclainu'd Coinhefcrre. 

Enjolras looked at Javert anti said to him: 

“Your friend.s have just .shot ytm.” 

VI 

THE AtiO.VY Ol'' DKaTlt AI'TEK THE AltONY OF LIFE 

A PECUr.iARiTY of this kind of war is that the attack on the barri- 
cades is almost always made in front, ainl that in general the as- 
sailants abstain from tinning the luisitions, whether it he that they 
dread amlinscades. or tliat they fear to become entangled in the 
crnokeil streets. 'I be whole attention of the insin-gents therefore 
was directed to tlie gretit barricaile, which was evidently the point 
still thre.alened, and where the struggle must infallibly recommence. 
Marins, liowever, lliought of the little harricade and went to it. 
It was deserted. ;ind was guarded only hy the lamp which flickered 
between the .Htones. 'I'lie little K'ue Nloniletour, moreover, and the 
liraneh streets de la iVtile Tnianderie and du Cygne, were per- 
fectly quiet. 

As Marius, the iiisfwction made, was retiring, he heard his name 
faintly pronmtnceti in the olisenrity : 

“Mousiettr Marius!” 

He slniddered, for he recognised the voice which had called him 
two ivntrs hefon*, through the grating in tlie Rue Plumet. 

f hilv this voice now st.emed to he hut a hrealh. 

He loolua! .tIkiuI him and saw nobody. 

Mariu.s thought he was decdvtnl, and that it was an illusion 
added hy Itis mind to the exlraorditiary realities which were throng- 
ing about him. lit? started Ut leave Uie retired recess in which the 
harricade w.as sitnatei!. 

“Monsieur Marius!” repe.aled the voice, 

'I’his time he coiiltl not dotilrt, lie hiid hcanl distinctly; he looked, 
and .saw nothing. 

“At your feet,” .sttkl the voice. 

He stfsqied ainl saw a form in the shadow, which was dragging 
itself towards him. It was crawling along the pavement. It was 
this that had Ri&gt;oken to him. . 

The l^p enabled him to distinguish a blouse, a pair of torn 



SAINTDENIS 959 

pantaloons of coarse velvet, bare feet, and something which re- 
sernbled a pool of blood. Marius caught a glimpse of a pale face 
which rose towards him and said to him : 

‘"You do not know me?” 

“No.” 

“Eponine.” 

Marius bent down quickly. It was indeed that unhappy chil4 
She was dressed as a man. 

“How came you here ? what are you doing there ?” 

“I am dying,” said she. 

There are words and incidents which rouse beings who are 
crushed. Marius exclaimed, with a start : 

“You are wounded ! Wait, I will carry you into the room ! They 
will dress your wounds ! Is it serious ? how shall I take you up so as 
not to hurt you ? Where are you hurt ? Help ! my God ! But what 
did you come here for?” 

And he tried to pass his arm under her to lift her. 

In lifting her he touched her hand. 

She uttered a feeble cry. 

“Have I hurt you ?” asked Marius. 

“A little.” 

“But I have only touched your hand.” 

She raised her hand into Marius* sight, and Marius saw in the cen- 
tre of that hand a black hole. 

“What is the matter with your hand ?” said he. 

, “It is pierced.” 

“Pierced?” 

“Yes.** 

“By what?** 

“By a ball.** 

“How?** 

“Did you see a musket aimed at you ?** 

“Yes, and a hand which stopped it.** 

“That was mine.** 

Marius shuddered. 

“What madness ! Poor child ! But that is not so bad, if that is all, 
it is nothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will care for you, 
people don’t die from a shot in the hand.” 

She murmured: 

“The ball passed through my hand, but it went out through my 
back. It is useless to take me from here. I will tell you how you can 
care for me, better than a surgeon. Sit down by me on that stone.** 
He obeyed; she laid her head on Marius* knees, and without 
looking at him, she said : 

“Oh ! how good it is ! How kind he is ! That is it ! I don’t suffer 
any more !*’

*'Your brother?*' asked Marius, who thought in the bitterest and 
most sorrowful depths of his heart, of the duties which his father 
had bequeathed him towards the Thenardiers, 'Vho is your 
brother ?*' 

‘ ^That little boy/^ 

^The one who is singing?” 

^Tes.” 

Marius started. 

“Oh ! don’t go away !” said she, “it will not be long now !” 

She was sitting almost upright, but her voice' was very low and 
broken by hiccoughs. At intervals the death-rattle interrupted her. 
She approached her face as near as she could to Marius’ face. She 
added with a strange expression: 

“Listen, I don’t want to deceive you. I have a letter in my pocket 
for you. Since yesterday. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I 
didn’t want it to reach you. But you would not lilie it of me perhaps 
when we meet again so soon. We do meet again, don’t we ? Take your 
letter.” 

She grasped Marius’ hand convulsively with her wounded hand, 
but she seemed no longer to feel the pain. She put Marius’ hand 
• into the pocket of her blouse. Marius really felt a paper there. 

“Take it,” said she. 

Marius took the letter. 

She made a sign of satisfaction and of consent. 

“Now for my pains, promise me — ” 

And she hesitated. 

“What?” asked Marius. 

“Promise me !” 

“I promise you.” 

“Promise to kiss me on the forehead when I am dead. I shall feel 
it.” 

She let her head fall back upon Marius’ knees and her eyelids 
closed. He thought that poor soul had gone. Eponine lay motionless ; 
but just when Marius supposed her for ever asleep, she slowly 
opened her eyes in which the gloomy deepness of death appeared, 
and said to him with an accent the sweetness of which already 
seemed to come from another world : 

“And then, do you know, Monsieur Marius, I believe I was a little 
in love with you/’ 

She essayed to smile again and expired. 

VII 

GAVROCHE A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES 

Marius kept his promise. He kissed that livid forehead from which 



962 L E S M I S E R A B L E S 

oozed an icy sweat. This was not inlulclity to Cosette ; it was a 

thoughtful and gentle farewell to an unhappy soul. 

He had not taken the letter which Lponine had given him with- 
out a thrill. He had felt at once the presence of an event. He was 
impatient to read it. The hi'art of man is thus niade; the unfor- 
tunate child had hardly closed her eyes when Marius thought to un- 
fold this paper. He laid her gently upon the ground, and went away. 
Something tohl him that he could not read that letter in sight of this 


^°Se\cnt to a candle in the haseineiit-rooni. Tt was a little note, 
foidcd and scaled with the elegant care of woman. The address 
was in a woinau’.s hand, and ran:_ 

“'I'o Monsieur, Monsieur Marius rontmercy, at M. Courfey- 
rac’s. Rue de la Verrerie, No. lo." 

He broke the seal and reail : 

“My beloved, alas! my fallier wishes to start immediately. We 
shall lie to-night in the Rue de I’llomme .\rme, No. 7. In a week we 
shall lie in Ktiglaml. C'oskttk June dth.” . 

Such was the innocence of this love that Marius did not even know 

Cosetle’.s handwriting. 

What hnppeneil mav he told in a few words, h^ponine had done 
it all. After the evening of the ord of June, she had liad a double . 
thought, to thwart tlu- projects of her father and the liandits upn 
the house in the Hue I'lumd. and to .separate Marius from Cosette. 
She had changed rags with the tirst young rogue who thought it 
amusing to dress as a woman whih* Eponine disguised herself as a 
man. It was .she who, in flie Champ de Mars, had given Jean Val- 
jeantiie expressive warning : Rnmirc. Jean Valjean returned home, 
and .said to Cosette : xUwt tn-nuiht. mtl tve arc goinci to the Rue 
de nioiitme Jtrmc tcilh Toussaiut. Next week wc Ml be in Lon- 
don CosetKs prostrated hv this unexjwcted blow, had hastily writ- 
ten two lines to Marius. Ihit how should she get the letter to the 
post ? .She dill not go out alone, aiul 'roussaint. surprised at such an 
errand, would surely show the letter to M. hatichelevent. In this 
anxiety, tiiwette saw. through tlie grating, Eponine in mens clothes, 
who w’a.s now wrowting contimudly ahout the garden. Cosette called 
'This young working-man" and liand&lt;‘d him five franc.s and the 
letter, saying to him ; "carry this letter to its address right away. 
EiHUiine put the letter in her jxwket. Ihe next day, June 5th, she 
went to Courfevrac's to ask for Manus, not to give him the letter, 
but. a thing wliich every jealous an&lt;l loving soul will understand, 
"to sec." There she waited for Marius, or, at least, for Courfe^ 
—still to see. When Courfeynae said to her: we are f. the bar- 

ricades. an idea flashed across her mmd.^ 1 o throw 
death as she would have thrown herself into any other, and to push 
Mariua into it. She followed Courfeyrac, made sure of the post

where they were building the barricade ; and very sure, since Marius 
had received no notice, and she had intercepted the letter, that he 
would at nightfall be at his usual evening rendezvous, she went to 
the Rue Plumet, waited there for Marius, and sent him, in the 
name of his friends, that appeal which must, she thought, lead him 
to the barricade. She counted upon Marius’ despair when he should 
not find Cosette ; she was not mistaken. She returned herself to the 
Rue de la Chanvrerie. We have seen what she did there. She died 
with that tragic joy of jealous hearts which drag the being they love 
into death with them, saying : nobody shall have him ! 

Marius covered Cosette’s letter with kisses. She loved him then? 
He had for a moment the idea that now he need not die. Then he 
said to himself : “She is going away. Her father takes her to Eng- 
land, and my grandfather refuses to consent to the marriage. Noth- 
ing is changed in the fatality.” Dreamers, like Marius, have these 
supreme depressions, and paths hence are chosen in despair. The 
fatigue of life is insupportable; death is sooner over. Then he 
thought that there were two duties remaining for him to fulfil : to 
inform Cosette of his death and to send her a last farewell, and to 
save from the imminent catastrophe which was approaching, this 
poor child, Eponine’s brother and Thenardier’s son. 

He had a pocket-book with him ; the same that had contained the 
pages upon which he had written so many thoughts of love for 
Cosette. He tore out a leaf and wrote with a pencil these few lines : 

“Our marriage was impossible. I have asked my grandfather, he 
has refused ; I am without fortune, and you also. I ran to your 
house, I did not find you, you know the promise that I gave you ? 
I keep it, I die, I love you. When you read this, my soul will be near 
you, and will smile upon you.” 

Having nothing to seal this letter with, he merely folded the 
paper, and wrote upon it this address : 

''To Mademoisnelle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M, Fauchelevenfs, 
Rue de VHomnie Arme, No. 7.” 

The letter folded, he remained a moment in thought, took his 
pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote these four lines on the first 
page with the same pencil : 

’ “My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my corpse to my grand- 
father’s, M. Gillenormand, Rue des Filles du Calvaire, No. 6, in 
the Marais.” 

tie put the book into his coat-pocket, then he called Gavroche. 
The gamin, at the sound of Marius’ voice, ran up with his joyous 
and devoted face; 

“Will you do something for me?” 

“Anything,” said Gavroche. “God of the good God ! without you. 
I should have been cooked, sure.” 

“You see this letter?”

BOOK FIFTEENTH 
THE RUE DE UHOMME ARMfi 
I 

BLOTTER, BLABBER 

What are the convulsions of a city compared with the emeutes of 
the soul? Man is a still deeper depth than the people. Jean Val- 
jean, at that very moment, was a prey to a frightful uprising. All the 
gulfs were reopened within him. He also, like Paris, was shuddering 
on the threshold of a foi'midable and obscure revolution. A few 
hours had sufficed. His destiny and his conscience were suddenly 
covered with shadow. Of him also, as of Paris, we might say : the 
two principles are face to face. The angel of light and the angel of 
darkness are to wrestle on the bridge of the abyss. Which of the 
two shall hurl down the other ? which shall sweep him away ? 

On the eve of that same day, June Sth, Jean Valjean, accom- 
panied by Cosette and Toussaint, had installed himself in the Rue 
de rPIomme Arme. A sudden turn of fortune awaited him there. 

Cosette had not left the Rue Plumet without an attempt at re- 
sistance. For the first time since they had lived together, Cosette’s 
will and Jean Val jean’s will had shown themselves distinct, and 
had been, if not conflicting, at least contradictory. There was ob- 
jection on one side and inflexibility on the other. The abrupt advice : 
remove, thrown to Jean Valjean by^an unknown hand, had so far 
alarmed him as to render him absolute. He believed himself tracked 
out and pursued, Cosette had to yield. 

They both arrived in the Rue dfe THomme Arme without opening 
their mouths or saying a word, absorbed in their personal medita- 
tions; Jean Valjean so anxious that he did not perceive Cosette’s 
sadness, Cosette so sad that she did not perceive Jean Val jean’s 
anxiety. 

Jean Valjean had brought Toussaint, which he had never done 
in his preceding absences. He saw 'that possibly he should not return 
to the Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behind, nor 
tell her his secret. Besides he felt that she was devoted and safe. 
Between domestic and master, treason begins with curiosity. But 
Toussaint, as if she had been predestined to be the servant of Jean 
Valjean, was not curious. She said through her stuttering, in her 
Barneville peasant’s speech : 'T am from same to same; I think my

busy with this little removal, set a cold fowl on the dining-room 
table, which Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to 
look at, 

^ This done, Cosette, upon pretext of a severe headache, said good 
night to Jean Valjean, and shut herself in her bedroom. Jean Val- 
jean ate a chicken’s wing with a good appetite, and, leaning on the 
tables, clearing his brow little by little, was regaining his sense of 
security. 

While he was making this frugal dinner, he became confusedly 
aware, on two or three occasions, of the stammering of Toussaint, 
who said to him : “Monsieur, there is a row ; they are fighting in 
Paris.” But, absorbed in a multitude of interior combinations, he 
paid no attention to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard. 

He arose and began to walk from the window to the door, and 
from the door to the window, growing calmer and calmer. 

With calmness, Cosette, ^his single engrossing care, returned to 
his thoughts. Not that he was troubled about this headache, a petty 
derangement of the nerves, a young girl’s pouting, the cloud of a 
moment, in a day or two it would be gone ; but he thought of the 
future, and, as usual, he thought of it pleasantly. After all, he saw 
no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course. At certain hours, 
everything seems impossible; at other hours, everything appears, 
easy; Jean Valjean was in one of those happy hours. They come 
ordinarily after the evil ones, like day after night, by that law of 
succession and contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature, 
and which superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street, 
in which he had taken refuge, Jean Valjean was relieved from all 
that had troubled him for some time past. From the very' fact that 
he had seen a good deal of dai'kness, he began to perceive a little 
blue sky. To have left the Rue Plumet without complication and 
without accident, was already a piece of good fortune. Perhaps it 
would be prudent to leave the country, were it only for a few months, 
and go to London. Well, they would go. To be. in France, to be in 
England, what did that matter, if he had Cosette with him ? Cosette 
was his nation. Cosette sufficed for his happiness ; the idea that 
perhaps he did not suffice for Cosette’s happiness, this idea, once 
his fever and his bane, did not even present itself to his mind. All 
his past griefs had disappeared, and he was in full tide of optimism. 
Cosette, being near him, seemed to belong to him ; an optical effect 
which everybody has experienced. He arranged in his own mind, 
and with every possible facility, the departure for England with 
Cosette, and he saw his happiness reconstructed, no matter where, 
in the perspective of his reverie. 

While yet walking up and down, with slow steps, his eye suddenly 
met something strange.

A circumstance strange and sad, Marius at that moment had not 
yet Cosette’s letter; chance had brought it, like a traitor, to Jean 
Valjean before delivering it to Marius. 

Jean Valjean till this day had never been vanquished when put 
to the proof. He had been subjected to fearful trials ; no violence 
of ill fortune had been spared him ; the ferocity of fate^ armed with 
every vengeance and with every scorn of society, had taken him 
for a subject and had greedily pursued him. He had neither re- 
coiled nor flinched before anything. He had accepted, when he must, 
every extremity ; he had sacrificed his reconquered inviolability of 
manhood, given up his liberty, risked his head, lost all, suffered 
all, and he had remained so disinterested and stoical that at times 
one might have believed him translated, like a martyr. His con- 
science, inured to all possible assaults of adversity, might seem for 
ever impregnable. Well, he who could have seen his inward moni- 
tor would have been compelled to admit that at this hour it was 
growing feeble. 

For, of all theJortures which he had Undergone in that inquisi- 
tion of destiny, this was the most fearful. Never had such pincers 
seized him. Fie felt the mysterious quiver of every latent sensibility. 
He felt the laceration of the unknown fibre. Alas, the sttpreme or- 
deal, let us say rather, the only ordeal, is the loss of the beloved 
being. 

Poor old Jean Valjean did not, certainly, love Cosette otherwise 
than as a father ; but, as we have already mentioned, into this pa- 
ternity the very bereavement of his life had introduced every love J 
he loved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, 
and he loved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either 
sweetheart or wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, 
that sentiment, also, the most indestructible of all, was mingled 
with the others, vague, ignorant, pure with tile purity of blindness, 
unconscious, celestial, angelic, divine; less like a sentiment than 
like an instinct, less like an instinct than like an attraction, imper- 
ceptible and invisible, but real; and love, properly speaking, ex- 
isted in his enormous tenderness for Cosette as does the vein of 
gold in the mountain, dark and virgin. 

Remember that condition of heart which we have already pointed 
out. No marriage was possible between them, not even that of souls ; 
and still it was certain that their destinies were espoused. Except 
Cosette, that is to say, except a childhood, Jean Valjean, in all'his 
long life, had known nothing of those objects which man can love. 
The passions and the loves which succeed one another, had not left, 
on him those successive greens, a light green over a dark green, 
which we notice upon leaves that pass the winter^ and upon men 
who pass their fifty yeats. In short, and we have more than once in- 
sisted upon it, all that interior fusion, all that whole, the resultv nt

bourg, that wretched seeker of amours, that romantic idler, that 
imbecile, that coward, for it is cowardice to come and make sweet 
eyes at girls who are beside their father who loves them. 

After he had fully determined that that young man was at the 
bottom of this state of affairs, and that it all came from him, he, 
Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had laboured so 
much upon his soul, the man who had made so many efforts to 
resolve all life, all misery, and all misfortune into love ; he looked 
within himself, and there he saw a spectre, Hatred. 

Great griefs contain dejection. They discourage existence. The 
man into whom they enter feels something go out of him. In youth, 
their visit is dismal ; in later years it is ominous. Alas I when the 
blood is hot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect upon the 
body like the flame upon the torch, when the sheaf of destiny is 
still full, when the heart, filled with a fortunate love, still has pulsa- 
tions which can be responded to, when we have before us the time 
to retrieve, when all women are before us, and all smiles, and all 
the future, and all the horizon, when the strength of life is com- 
plete, if despair is a fearful thing, what is it then in old age; when 
the years rush along, growing bleaker and bleaker, at the twilight 
hour, when we begin to see the stars of the tomb ! 

While he was thinking, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean arose, 
and asked her : 

‘Tn what direction is it ? Do you know T' 

Toussaint, astonished, could only answer : 

‘Tf you please?'’ 

Jean Valjean resumed: 

‘‘Didn’t you tell me just now that they were fighting?” 

“Oh! yes, monsieur,” answered Toussaint. “It is over by Saint 
Merry.” 

There are some mechanical impulses which come to us, without 
our knowledge even, from our deepest thoughts. It was^ doubtless 
under the influence of an impulse of this kind, and of which he was 
hardly conscious, that Jean Valjean five minutes afterwards found 
himself in the street. 

He was bare-headed, seated upon the stone block by the door of 
his house. He seemed to be listening. 

The night had come.

TilE GAMIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT 

How much time did he pass thus? What were the ebbs and the 
flows of that tragic meditation ? did he straighten up ? did he remain 
bowed ? had he been bent so far as to break ? could he yet straighten

The street was emjtty. A few an xii uis hfuirgcois, who were rapidly 
returning home, hardly pereeivt-d him. h'.v&lt;‘ry man for himself in 
times of peril. The lamplighter c.ame as usual to light the lamp 
which hung i‘.xactly opposite the drsir of No. 7, and went awav^ 
Jean Valjean, to one who luu! ex;iinined him in that shadow, would 
not have seemed a living man. 'I’lu-re he_ was, seated upon the block 
by his dour, inimov.alile as a goldin &lt;»f ice. 'i'luTe is congelation in 
de.spair. The tocsin was lieard, and vague stormy sounds were 
heard. In the midst of ail (his coiivnlsive el.imonr of the hell mingled 
with the emeiile, flu; clock of Si, I’miFs struck eleven, gravely and 
without haste, for the tocsin is man ; the hour is Clod. The passing 
of the hour had no etiVct upon Jean Valjean ; Jean Valjean did not 
stir, 1 fowtrver, .'ilmost at that very moment, tlu're was a sharp ex- 
plosion in the direction of the n’larkets, a second followed, more 
violent still; it was iindtuhly that attack on tin; barricade of the 
Kue de la t 'hanvrerie wliich we have just seen repul.sed by Marius. 
At this donhie discltarge, tlie fury of which scenied increased by the 
stupor of the niglit, Jean \ aljea’n w.is .slanted ; he looked up in the 
direction wliema- the sound c;«ue ; then lie sank down upon the block, 
folded his arms, and liis head dmpped slowly upon hi.s breast. ' 
lie resumed Itis dark dialogm- with ItiniMdf, 

Sndtleidy he raised his evio. snmelioiiy was walking in the street 
hi' heard siepis iie.ar him, he louked, and, by the light of the lamp[ 
in the tlireetion of the .\rchiv«-s, he jierceived ti livid face, young and 
radituil, 

(iavroclie had just arrived in the Kue de ri fomme Armc. 
Cmvrttche was looking in the air, and appeared to be searching 
for something. He .s;tw jean N’aljean perfectly, hut he took no 
notice of him. 

(JavrtK’lte, after hioking into the ;iir. looked on the ground ; he 
raised Itiniself on tipttie and fehil of the doors and windows of the 
ground Hoors; they were ait closed, bolted, and chained. After hav- 
ing found live or sis hotis«'s liarrica«t«Hl in thi,s way, the gamm 
slirtigged his .shonlder.s, and ttx»k counsel with himself in these 
terms : 

‘•Colly!" 

'J'hen he liegan to look into the air again. 

Jean Valjean, who, the instant before, in the .slate o&gt;f mmd in 
which lit* was, would not have spoken nor even replieti to anybody, 
felt irresistihly inifielletl to itddress a word to this child. 

"Sniall hoy," .said he, "what is the mailer with you?” 

"'rite matter is titat f «tn hungry," answered Gavroche tartly. 
Ant! he added : "SinaU yourself." 

Jtain Valjean felt in’ his poeket f tit] took out a five-franc piects 



S A I N t D E N I S 973 

But Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species^ and who passed 
quickly from one action to another, had picked up a stone. He had 
noticed a lamp. 

^'Hold on,'' said he, ^'you have your lamps here still. You are not 
regular, my friends. It is disorderly. Break me that." 

And he threw the stone into the lamp, the glass from which fell 
with such a clatter that some bourgeois, hid behind their curtains 
in the opposite house, cried : ^‘There is 'Ninety-three !" 

The lamp swung violently and went out. The street became sud- 
denly dark. 

''That's it, old street," said Gavroche, "put on your nightcap." 

And turning towards Jean Valjean: 

"What do you call that gigantic monument that you have got 
there at the end of the street? That's the Archives, isn't it? They 
ought to chip off these big fools of columns slightly, and make a 
genteel barricade of them." 

Jean Valjean approached Gavroche. 

"Poor creature," said he, in an undertone, and speaking to him- 
self, "he is hungry." 

And he put the hundred-sous piece into his hand. 

Gavroche cocked up his nose, astonished at the size of this big 
soil ; he looked at it in the dark, and the whiteness of the big sou 
dazzled him. He knew five-f ranc pieces by hearsay ; their, reputation 
was agreeable to him ; he was delighted to see one so near. He said : 
"let us contemplate the tiger." 

He gazed at it for a few moments in ecstasy; then, turning 
towards Jean Valjean, he handed him the piece, and said majestic- 
ally : . ^ 

"Bourgeois, I prefer to break lamps. Take back your wild beast. 
You don't corrupt me. It has five claws ; but it don't scratch me." 

"Have you a mother ?" inquired Jean Valjean. 

Gavroclae answered : 

"Perhaps more than you have." 

"Well," replied Jean Valjean, "keep this money for your mother.” 

Gavroche felt softened. Besides he had just noticed that the man 
who was talking to him, had no hat, and that inspired him with con- 
fidence. 

"Really," said he, "it isn't to prevent my breaking the lamps ?'^ 

"Break all you like." 

"You are a fine fellow," said Gavroche. 

And he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets., 

His confidence increasing, he added : 

"Do you belong in the street?" 

"Yes;why?" 

"Could you show me number seven ?” 

"What do you want with number seven ?''

Ill 

WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT SLEEP 

Jean Valjean went in with Marius* letter. 

He groped his way upstairs, pleased with the darkness like an 
owl which holds his prey, opened and softly closed the door, list- 
ened to see if he heard any sound, decided that, according to all 
appearances, Cosette and Toussaint were asleep, plunged three or 
four matches into the bottle of the Fumade tinder-box before he 
could raise a spark, his hand trembled so much; there was theft 
in what he was about to do. At last, his candle was lighted, he leaned 
his elbows on the table, unfolded the paper, and read. 

In violent emotions, we do not read, we prostrate the paper which 
we hold, so to speak, we strangle it like a victim, we crush the paper, 
we bury the nails of our wrath or of our delight in it; we run to 
the end, we leap to the beginning ; the attention has a fever ;^it com- 
prehends by wholesale, alrbost, the essential; it seizes a point, and 
all the rest disappears. In Marius* note to Cosette, Jean Valjean 
saw only these words. 

“ 1 die. When you read this, my soul will be near you.** 

Before these two lines, he was horribly dazzled ; he sat a moment 
as if crushed by the change of emotion which was wrought within 
him, he looked at Marius* note with a sort of drunken astonishment;' 
he had before his eyes that splendour, the death of the hated being. 

He uttered a hideous cry of inward joy. So, it was finished. The 
end came sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who en-^ 
cumbered his destiny was disappearing. He was going away of him-’ 
self, freely, of his own accord. Without any intervention on his,‘. 
Jean Valjean*s part, without any fault of his, “that man** was about 
to die. Perhaps even he was already dead. — Here his fever began to 
calculate.— No. He is not dead yet. The letter was evidently written 
to be read by Cosette in the morning; since those two discharges 
which were heard between eleven o’clock and midnight, there had 
been nothing; the barricade will not be seriously attacked till day- 
break; but it is all the same, for the moment “that man** meddled 
with this war, he was lost; he is caught in the net. Jean Valjean 
felt that he was delivered. He would then find himself once more 
alone with Cosette. Rivalry ceased ; the future recommenced. He had

SAINT DENIS 977 

Gavroche, while yet singing, was lavish of pantomime. Action is 
i:he foundation of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory 
of masks, made more convulsive and more fantastic grimaces than 
the mouths of a torn cloth in a heavy wind. Unfortunately, as he 
was alone and in the night, it was neither seen nor visible. There are 
such lost riches. 

Suddenly he stopped short. ''Let us interrupt the romance,’’ said 
he. 

His cat-like eye had just distinguished in the recess of a porte- 
cochere what is called in painting a harmony : that is to say, a being 
and a thing ; the thing was a hand-cart, the being was an Auvergnat 
who was sleeping in it. 

The arms of the cart rested on the pavement and the Auverg- 
nat’s head rested on the tail-board of the cart. His body was curled 
up on the inclined plane and his feet touched the ground. 

Gavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, recog- 
nised a drunken man. It was some conier-j^orter who had drunk 
too much and who was sleeping too much. 

"This,” thought Gavroche, '‘is what summer nights are good for. 
The Auvergnat is asleep in his cart. We take the cart for the re- 
public and we leave the Auvergnat to the monarchy.” 

His mind had just received this illumination : 

"That cart would go jolly well on our barricade.” 

The Auvergnat was snoidng. 

Gavroche drew the cart softly by the back end and the Auverg- 
nat by the forward end, that is to say, by the feet, and, in a minute, 
the Auvergnat, imperturbable, was lying flat on the pavement. The 
cart was delivered. 

Gavroche, accustomed to face the unforeseen on all sides, al- 
ways had everything about him. He felt in one of his pockets, and 
took out a scrap of paper and an end of a red pencil pilfered from 
some carpenter^ 

He wrote : 

^^French Republic 

"Received your cart.” 

And he signed ; '‘Gavroche.” 

This done, he put the paper into the pocket of the still snoring 
Auvergnat’s velvet waistcoat, seized the cross-piece with both hands, 
and started off in the direction of the markets, pushing the cart be- 
fore him at a full gallop with a glorious triumphal uproar. 

This was perilous. There was a post at the Imprimerie Royale. 
Gavroche did not think of it This post was occupied by the National. 
Guards of the banlieue. A certain watchfulness began to excite the 
squad, and their heads were lifted from their camp-beds. Two lamps 
broken one after another, that song sung at the top of the voice, it 
was a good deal for streets so cowardly, which long to go to sleep

SAINT DENIS 975 

At the sergeant’s cry, the men of the post had rushed out pell- 
mell ; the sound of the musket produced a general discharge at ram 
dom, after which they reloaded and began again. 

This musketry at blindman’s buff lasted a full quarter of an 
hour, and killed several squares of glass. 

Meanwhile Gavroche, who had run back desperately, stopped five 
or six streets off, and sat down breathless upon the block at the cor- 
ner of the Enfants Rouges. 

He listened attentively. 

After breathing a few moments, he turned in the direction in 
which the firing was raging, raised his left hand to the level of his 
nose, and threw it forward three times, striking the back of his 
head with his right hand at the same time : a sovereign gesture into 
which the Parisian gamin has condensed French irony, and which 
is evidently effective, since it has lasted already for a half century. 

This cheerfulness was marred by a bitter reflection : 

‘‘Yes,"’ said he, ‘T grin, I twist myself, I run over with joy; but 
I am losing my way, I shall have to make a detour. If I only get to 
the barricade in timt*. 

Thereupon, he resumed his course. 

And, while yet running : 

‘‘Ah, yes, where was I V said he. 

He began again to sing his song; as he plunged rapidly through 
the streets, and this receded into the darkness : 

Mais il reste encor des bastilles, 

Et je vais mettre le hol^ 

Dans Tordre public que voila 
Ou vont les belles filles. 

Lon la. 

Quelqu’un vent-il jouer aux quiiles? 

Tout Tancien monde s'ecroula 

Quand la grosse boule roula Oil vont, etc. 

Vieux bon peuple, a coups de bequilles, 

Cassons ce Louvre ou s’etala 

La monarchic en falbala. Ou vont, etc. 

Nous en avons force les grilles, 

Le roi Charles-Dix ce jour-la 

Tenait mal et se decolla. Ou vont, etc. 

The taking up of arms at the post was not without result. The 
cart was conquered, the drunkard was taken prisoner. One was 
put on the wood-pile ; the other afterwards tried before a court- 
martial, as an accomplice. The public ministry of the time availed it- 
self of this circumstance to show its indefatigable zeal for the de- 
fence of society. , 

Gavroche's adventure, preserved among the traditions of the 
quartier of the Temple, is one of the most terrible reminiscences 
of the old bourgeois of the Marais, and is entitled in their memory: 
Nocturnal attack on the post of the Imprimerie Royale. 




JEAN VALTEAN 




BOOK FIRST— WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLS 

I 

THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SYCLLA 
OF THE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE 

The two most memorable barricades which the observer of social 
diseases might mention do not belong to the period in which the ac- 
tion of this book is placed. These two barricades, symbols both, un- 
der two different aspects, of a terrible situation, rose from the 
earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the grand- 
est street war which history has seen. 

It sometimes happens that, even against principles, even against 
liberty, equality, and fraternity, even against universal suffrage, even 
against the government of all by all, from the depths of its anguish, 
of its discouragements, of its privations, of its fevers, of its dis- 
tresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorance, of its darkness, that great 
madman, the rabble, protests, and the populace gives battle to the 
people. , ^ 

The vagabonds attack the common I'ight ; the ochlocracy rises 
against the demos. . ^ 

Those are mournful days ; for there is always a certain amount 
of right even in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and these 
ViTords, which are intended for insults, vagabonds, rabble, ochlo- 
cracy, populace, indicate, alas ! rather the fault of those who reign 
than the fault of those who suffer ; rather the fault of the'privileged 
than the fault of the outcasts. ' ^ 

As for us, we never pronounce these wcij-ds save with sorrow 
and with respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which 
they correspond, it often finds in them many grandeurs among the, 
miseries. Athens was an ochlocracy; the vagabonds made Holland; 
the populace more than once saved Rome; and the rabble followed 
Jesus Christ. 

There is no thinker who has not sbmetimes contemplated the 
nether magnificences. . 

It was of this rabble, doubtless, that St. Jerome thought, and of 
all those poor people, and of all those vagabonds, and of all those 
wretches, whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when he 
uttered those mysterious words : Pex urbis, lex orbis.

chair, the cabbage stump, the scrap, the rag, and the malediction, 
It was great and it was little. It was the bottomless pit parodied 
upon the spot by chaos come again. The mass with the atom ; the 
side wall thrown down and the broken dish; a menacing fraterni- 
sation of ail rubbish. Sisyphus had cast in his rock and Job his pots- 
herd. Upon the whole, terrible. It was the acropolis of the raga- 
muffins. Carts overturned roughened the slope ; an immense dray 
was displayed there, crosswise, the axle pointing to the sky, and 
seemed a scar upon that tumultuous fagade ; an omnibus, cheerily 
hoisted by main strength to the very top of the pile, as if the ar- 
chitects of that savagery would add sauciness to terror, presented 
its unharnessed pole to unknown horses of the air. This gigantic 
mass, the alluvium of emeute, brought before the mind an Ossa 
upon Pelion of all the revolutions ; ’93 upon ’89, the 9th Thermidor 
upon the 10th of August, the 18th Brumaire upon the 21st of Janu- 
ary, Vendemaire upon Prairial, 1848 upon 1830. The place deserved 
the pains, and that barricade was worthy to ai)pear on the very spot 
where the Bastille had disappeared. Were the ocean to make dykes, 
it would build them thus. The fury of the flood was imprinted 
upon that misshapen obstruction. What flood? The multitude. You 
would have thought you saw uproar petrified. You would have 
thought you heard, upon that barricade, as if there they had been 
upon their hive, the humming of the enormous black bees of prog- 
ress by force. Was it a thicket? was it a Bacchanal? was it a fort- 
ress? Dizziness seemed to have built it by flappings of its wing. 
There was something of the cloaca in this redoubt, and something 
of Olympus in this jumble. You saw there, in a chaos full of de- 
spair, rafters from roofs, patches from garrets with their wall 
paper, window sashes with all their glass planted in the rubbish, 
awaiting artillery, chimneys torn down, wardrobes, tables, benches, 
a howling topsy-turvy, and those thousand beggarly things, the 
refuse even of the mendicant, which contain at once fury and 
nothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people, 
tatters of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Fau- 
bourg Saint Antoine had swept them there to its door by one colos- 
sal sweep of the broom, making of its misery its barricade. Logs 
shaped like chopping blocks, dislocated chains, wooden frames with 
brackets having the form of gibbets, wheels projecting horizontally 
from the rubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the for- 
bidding form of the old tortures suffered by the people. The bar-' 
ricade Saint Antoine made a weapon of everything ; all that civil 
war can throw at the head of society came from it ; it was not battle, 
it was paroxysm ; ‘the carbines which defended that stronghold, 
among which were some blunderbusses, scattered bits of delft- 
wj?re, knuckle-bones, coat buttons, eveii table castors, dangerous 
projectiles on account of the copper. This barricade was furious ; it 



986 L E S MIS 12 K A I! L E S 

threw up to the clouds an inexpressible clamour ; at certain moments 
defying the army, it covered ilsel f uuth multitude and with tempest’ 
a mob of flaming heads crowned it ; a swarming filled it ; its crest 
was thorny with muskets, with swords, with clubs, with axes, with 
pikes, and with bayonets ; a huge red fl;ig llultered in the wind there 
were heard cries of conimand, songs of attack, the roll of the ’drum 
the sobs of woman, and the dark wild kmghter of the starving. It 
was huge and living; and, as from tlie Imck of an electric b^t 
there came from it a crackling of thunders. 'I'he spirit of revolu- 
tion covered witli its cloud that summit whereon growled this voice 
of the people which is like; tin; voice of Clod; a strange majesty 
emanated from that titanic hodful of refuse. It was a garbage heap, 
and it was Sinai'. 

As we liave before said, it at kicked in the name of the Revolu- 
tion, what? the Revolution. 'I'liis barricade, chance, disorder, be- 
wildermcnt, misunderstanding, the unknown, had opposed to it the 
Constituent A.ssemhly, the siivcreignty of the people, universal suf- 
frage, tile nation, the reiiuldie; :md it was tlic Carmagnole defying 
the Marseillaise. 

.An insane, Init heroic defianee, for tliis old Isanliourg is a hero. 

'I'he Fanhourg and its mlouht lent each other aid. The Faubourg 
put its shoulder to the redoubt, the redoiilit braced itself upon the 
Faubourg. T!ie huge harric.ade extended like a cliff upon which 
broke tlie strategy of the generals of .Africa, .Its caverns, its excres- 
cences, its warts. 'its humps, made grimaces, so to speak, and sneered 
beneath the smoke, (jrape vanislied there in the shapeless; shells 
sank in, were .swallowed up, were cngnlfed; bullets succeeded only 
in boring holes ; of what nse to cannonade chaos ? And regiments, ac- 
customeil to the most savage sights of war, looked with anxious eye 
upon tins kind of wild beast nalouht, by its bristling, a wild te, 
and by its enormity, a mountain. 

A mile from there, ;it the corner of the Rue du Temple which runs 
into the hunlevtird near the Ciiatean d'Fau, if you advanced your 
head iHiklly beyond the jioiiit fonnetl by the front of the Dallemagne 
warehouse, yon pereeivetl in the distanee, beyond the canal, in the 
street which* mounts the slojifs of_ Itelleville, at the culminating point 
of the hill, a strange wall reaching the second story of the house, 
fronts, a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the 
houses on the left, its if the street had foltkid Ixick its highest wall, 
to shut itself ahnijitly in. This wall was Iniilt of paying-stones. It 
was straight, correct, cokl, jieriRunUcnlar, levelled with the square, 
built liy the line, aligned liy the phmnnet. Cement doubtless there 
was mine, hut tis in certain Komaii walls, that did not weaken its 
rigid architecture, iwom its height its depth could be guessed. The 
entablature was mathematically pamllel to the base. Here and there 
could he distingui-shed, on the grey surface, loopholes almost h- 



JEAN VALJEAN 98F 

visible, which resembled black threads. These loopholes were 
separated from each other by equal intervals. The street was deserted 
as far as could be seen. Every window and every door closed. In the 
background rose this obstruction, which made of the street a cul-de- 
sac ; an immovable and quiet wall ; nobody could be seen, nothing 
could be heard ; not a cry, not a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre. 

The dazzling June sun flooded this terrible thing with light. 

This was the barricade of the Faubourg du Temple. 

As soon as the ground was reached and it was seen, it was impos- 
sible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before this 
mysterious apparition. It was fitted, dovetailed, imbricated, recti- 
linear, symmetrical, and deathly. There was in it science and dark- 
ness. You felt that the chief of that barricade was a geometer or a 
spectre. You beheld it and you spoke low. 

From time to time, if anybody, soldier, officer, or representative 
of the people, ventured to cross the solitary street, a sharp and low 
whistling was heard, and the passer fell wounded or dead, or, if 
he escaped, a ball v/as seen to bury itself in some closed shutter, in 
a space between the stores, in the plastering of a wall. Sometimes 
a large ball. For the men of the barricade had made of two pieces 
of cast-iron gas-pipe, stopped at one end with oakum and fire-clay, 
two small guns. No useless expenditure of powder. Almost every 
shot told. There were a few corpses here and there, and pools of 
blood upon the pavement, I recollect a white butterfly flying back 
and forth in the street. Summer does not abdicate. 

In the vicinity, the pavements of the porte-cocheres were covered 
with wounded. 

You felt yourself beneath the eye of somebody whom you did not 
see, and that the whole length of the street was held tinder aim. 

Massed behind the sort of saddleback which the narrow bridge over 
the canal makes at the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the 
soldiers of the attacking column, calm and collected, looked upon this 
dismal redoubt, this immobility, this impassability, whence death 
came forth. Some crept on the ground as far as the top of the curve 
of the bridge, taking care that. their shakos did not show over it. 

The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a 
shuddei\ ''How that is built T said he to a representative. ^'Not one 
stone projects beyond another. It is porcelain/' At that moment a 
ball broke the cross on his breast, and he fell. 

“The cowards!'’ it was said. ‘‘But let them show themselves! let 
us see them ! they dare not? they hide?" The barricade of the Fau- 
bourg du Temple, defended by eighty men, attacked by ten thou- 
sand, held out three days. On the fourth day, they did as at Zaatcha 
and at Constantine; they pierced through the houses, they went 
along the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty 



98S L E S M I S E R A B L S 

cowards thought of flight; all wore killed, except the chief, Barth- 
elemy, of whom we shall speak ju'cseiitly. 

The harricade St. Anluine was the tumult of thunders ; the barri- 
cade du Temple was silence. I'here was hetween these two redoubts 
the difFerence hetween the terrible and the ominous. The one seemed 
a gaping mouth ; the other &lt;i nuisk. _ 

Admitting that the gloomy and gigantic insurrection of June was 
composed of an anger and an enigma ; you felt in the first barricade 
the dragon, and heliind (he .second the sphinx. 

The.s'e two fortresses were hnilt hy two men, one named Cournet 
the other Barthelemy. fonrnej inade the barricade .Saint Antoine; 
Barthelemy the harricade du Temple. Bach wa.s the image of him 
who built it. 

Cournet was a man of tall stature ; he had liroad shoulders, ared 
face, a inu.scular arm, a hold heart, a loyal .soul, a sincere and terrible 
eye. Intrejiid, energetic, iraseihle, stormy, the most cordial of men, 
the most formidable of warriors. War, conflict, the melee, were the 
air he breathed, and put liim in good-lumionr. He had lieen a naval 
officer, and, from his carriage and his voict*, you would have guessed 
that he .sprang from the ocean, and that h(^ came from the tempest; 
he contimu'd the hurricane in battle. Save in genius, there was in 
Cournet somediing of Dantnii. ;is, .save in divinity, there was in 
Danlon sometliiiig of liercitles. 

Barthvlemy, thin, puny, pale, taciturn, was a kind of tragic gamin 
who. struck liy a .sergent de ville, watched for him, waited for him, 
and killed him, tuid. tit seventeen, was .sent to the galleys. He came 
out, and built tlii.; barricade. 

I.aler, a terrilde thing, at London, both outlaws, Barthelemy

perhaps, began with the galleys in l'‘ranee, and ended with the gal-

iMurricade of the Rue dc la Clianvrerie was only a rough draught and 



JEAN VALJEAN 989 

an embryo compared with the two colossal barricades which we have 
just sketched; but, for the period, it was formidable.. 

The insurgents, under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer 
looked to anything, turned the night to advantage. The barricade 
was not only repaired, but made larger. They raised it two feet. Iron 
bars planted in the paving stones resembled lances in rest. All sorts 
of rubbish added, and brought from all sides, increased the exterior 
intricacy. The redoubt was skilfully made over into a wall within 
and a thicket without. 

They rebuilt the stairway of paving-stones, which permitted as- 
cent, as upon a citadel wall. 

They put the barricade in order, cleared up the basement room, 
took the kitchen for a hospital, completed the dressing of the wounds ; 
gathered up the powder scattered over the floor and the tables, cast 
bullets, made cartridges, scraped lint, distributed the arms of the 
fallen, cleaned the interior of the redoubt, picked up the fragments, 
carried away the corpses. 

They deposited the dead in a heap in the little Rue Mondetour, of 
which they were still masters. The pavement was red for a long time 
at that spot. Among the dead were four National Guards of the 
banlieue. Enjolras had their uniforms laid aside. 

Enjolras advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras was an 
order. Still, three or four only^ profited by it. Feuilly employed these 
two hours in engraving this inscription on the wall which fronted 
the wine-shop : 

‘^VlVENT LES PeUPLES !” 

These three words, graven in the stone with a nail, were still 
legible on that, wall in 1848. 

The three women took advantage of the night's respite to disap- 
pear finally, which made the insurgents breathe more freely. 

They found I'efuge in some neighbouring house. 

Most of the wounded could and would still fight. There were, 
upon a straw mattress and some bunches of straw, in the kitchen 
now become a hospital, five men severely wounded, two of whom 
were Municipal Guards. The wounds of the Municipal Guards 
were dressed first. , 

Nothing now remained in the basement room but Mabeuf, under 
his black cloth, and Javert bound to the post. 

^This is the dead-room,^' said Enjolras. 

In the interior of this room, feebly lighted by a candle, at the 
very end the funereal table being behind the post like a horizontal 
bar, a sort of large dim cross was produced by Javert standing, and 
Mabeuf lying. ' 

The pole of the omnibus, although maimed by the musketry, was 
still high enough for them to hang a flag upon it. 



990 I. n « M I S K U A 1( I. 1C s 

Enjolras, who had this quality of a chief, always to do as he said, 
fastened the pierced and hliKidy coat of the slain old man to this 
pole. 

No meals could now he had. 'Iliere was neither bread nor meat. 
The. fifty men of the harricatle, in the sixteen hours that they had 
been there, had very soon exhausted the meagre provisions of the 
wine-shop. In a tii veil jin ly, eveiy Itarritade which holds out, in- 
evitably hcsainu's llie ra ft of le Moduse. They must resign themselves

rounded by iiisnr.!;ents wliu were asking for Itread, to all those war- 
riors, crying: "Sontething to e;u !” answered: "What for? it is 
three oVloek. .'\l four oVlucU we ,shrd! be tlead." 

As they eonld eat notliiiig, blniolras forbade drinking. He pro- 
hibited wine, and |»tti them on ;dluvvaiie«" of bnindy. 

They bimid in the cellar sotne tiileeu bottles, full and hermetically 
sealed. ICnjolras anti t ne.beierre examineil tlieni. .'Xs they came up 
C'oinbeferre said : "It is some of the old stock of bather Hucheloup 
wl»&gt; began ;is a grocer." 

‘‘It ought to be j‘,ennine wine," observed Ibissuct. “It is lucky 
llijil ( irant.aire isasleei*. H be vvt‘re&gt;in bis fed, we .should have hard 
work to save those bo'iU-s," baiioliais, in si»i!e of the murmurs, put

touch them, ami that tbev miglit be as it were consecrated, he had 
them placeil iiiuier the table on wbieh l-alher Mabeuf Uiy. 

About twuoVloek in tlie morning, they took a eount. There were 
kft thirty-seven of theiii. 

D,iy was begiitnint; to dawn. 'I'hey lun! just extinguished the torch 
which had lieen replaced in its soeket of p:a ing sioiies. The interior 
of the barrie.ade. that little convi taken in on the streel, wa.s drowned 
in rlarkiiess, and seemed, ihroiigh the dim twilight horror, the deck 
of a disabled ship. The eonibaiants going b;tck and forth, moved 
aliuiU in it like black forms. Above ibis friglilful nest of shadow, 
the stories of the iiniie botises were lividly outlined ; at the very top 
tfic wan chimneys appeared. The skv !»;u! tliat ch.-irnting undecided 
hue, which is perhaps while, and periiaps blue. .Some birds were 
flying with joy ful notes. The tail house wbicli ffirmcd the rear of the 
barricade, being towards llw east, had a ro.sv refleelion m»on its roof. 
At die window on the third story, the nutrniiig breeze played with 
ihe grey hairs on the dead man's hejul. 

“1 am delighted that the torch is extiuguished," said Courfeyrae 
t» Feiiilly, "That torch, startled in the wind, annoyed me. It ap- 
peared to he afraifl. 'nie light of a torch reseinhles the wisdom of a 
cmr.trd ; it I* clear, becavisc it tremhles." 

The dawn awakens minds as well as birds ; all w«tr« chatting. 



JEAN VALJEAN 991 

Joly, seeing a cat prowling about a water-spout, extracted philos- 
ophy therefrom. 

‘‘What is the cat?” he exclaimed. “It is a correction. God, having 
made the mouse, said : ‘Hold here, I have made a blunder.' And he 
made the cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse, plus 
the cat, is the revised and corrected proof of creation.” 

Combeferre, surrounded by students and workmen, spoke of the 
dead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Le 
Cabuc, and of the stern sadness of Enjolras. He said : 

“Harmodius and Aristogeiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, 
Cromwell, Charlotte Corday, Sand — all, after the blow, had their 
moment of anguish. Our hearts are so fluctuating, and human life 
is such a mystery that, even in' a civic murder, even in a liberating 
murder, if there be such, the remorse of having stricken a man sur- 
passes the joy of having served the human race.” 

And, such is the course of conversation, a moment afterwards, 
by a transition from Jean Prouvaire's rhymes, Combeferre was 
comparing the translators of the Georgies, Raux with Cournand, 
Cournand with Delille, pointing out the few passages translated by 
Maliilatre, particularly the prodigies at the death of Csesar; and 
from this word. Csesar, they came to Brutus. 

“Csesar,” said Combeferre, “fell justly. Cicero was severe upon 
Caesar, and he was right. This severity is not diatribe. When Zoilus 
insults Homer, when Maevius insults Virgil, when Vise insults Ho- 
liore, when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Freron insults Voltaire, 
it is an old law of envy and hatred which is at work ; genius atracts 
insult, great men are always barked at more or less. But Zoilus and 
Cicerp are two. Cicero is a judge through the soul, even as Brutus 
is a jucige through the sword. I condemn, for my own part, that final 
justice, the sword ; but antiquity admitted it. Cassar, the violator of 
the Rubicon, conferring, as coming from himself, the dignities 
which came from the people, not rising upon the entrance of the 
senate, acted, as Eutropius says, the part of a king and almost of a 
tyrant, regia ac pene tyrannica. He was a great m.an ; so, much the 
worse, or so much the better ; the lesson is the greater. His twenty=- 
fhree wounds touch me less than the spittle in the face of Jesus 
Christ. Ccesar was stabbed by senators ; Christ was slapped by lack- 
.eys. In the greater -outrage, we feel the God.” 

Bossuet, overlooking the talkers from the top of the heap of 
paving-stones, exclaimed, carbine in hand : 

“O Cydathenseum, O Myrrhinus, O Prohalinthe, O graces of 
Jiantides. Oh ! who will give me to pronounce the verses of Homer 
like a Greek of Laurium or of Edapteon ?”

UGIIT AND DARKNESS 

Enjolras had gotie Id make a reounnaissance. lie went out by the 
little Rue Momlctour, cree])inK along by the houses. 

The insurgents, we nnist say, were full of hope. The manner in 
which they had repelled tlie attack during the night, had led them 
almost to contemjit in advance fur the alack at daybreak. They 
awaited it. and smiled :it it. They had no more &lt;loubt of their success 
than of their cause. Moreover, help wa.s evitlenlly about to come. 
They counted on it. With that facility for triumphant prophecy 
which is a part of the .strength of the lighting Frenchman, they di- 
vided into three distinct piitises the &lt;lav whicli was opening: at six 
o’clock in the morning a regiment, “which liad been laboured witli,” 
would come ovi‘r. At nooti. insurrection of all I’aris; at sundown, 
revolution. 

They heard the tocsin of .Saint Merry, which had not been silent 
a monient since the evening ; a proof that the. other barricade, the 
great one, that of Jeanne, still held utit_. 

All these ho|)es were eoinmnniealed from one to another in a sort 
of cheerful yet terrible vvhis|)er, which resembled the hiuz of a hive 
of lu'cs at war. 

Fnjolrtis reaiipettred. He returned from his gloomy eagle’s walk 
in tlie obscurity without. He listened for a moment to all this joy 
with folded arms, one hand «iver hi.s niouth. 'fhen, fresh and rosy 
in the growing whiteness of the morning, he said; 

“The whole army of Paris lights. A tliird of that army is pressing 
ujjon tlte barricade in which yo»i are. llesides the National Guard, 
I distinguished the slir!ko.s of the h'ifth of the line and the colours 
of the Si.\th Legion. Von will be attacked iit an hour. As for the 
])fople. they were boiling yesterdtiy, but this morning they do not 
stir. Nothing to esjtect, nothing to hope. No more frohi a Faubourg 
than from a fegiineni. ^'ott are .-ibandiHied.’' 

These words fell nuon the hn/ring i&gt;f the groups, and wrought 
the effect whidt the lirst tlrops of tlie teinjiest produce upon the 
swarm. All were t!um!&gt;. 'riiere was .a inoment of inexpressible si- 
lence, when you might have hetirti the flight of death. 

Tills inoment wtis sliort. 

A voice, from the most obscure depths of the groups, cried to 
Etijolras : . , , 

“So l«* it. tts make the barricade twenty feet high, and let us 
all stand by it. Citij!en.s, let us offer tlie protest of corpses. Let us 
show that.’ if the people abandon the republicans, the republicans 
do not abandon the jieople,'' . , , , , t 

These words relieved the minds of all from the painful cloud oi

personal anxieties. They were greeted by an enthusiastic acclama- 
tion. 

The name of the man who thus spoke was never known ; it was 
some obscure blouse-wearer, an unknown, a forgotten man, a pass- 
ing hero, that great anonymous always found in human crises and 
in social births, who, at the proper instant, speaks the decisive word 
supremely, and who vanishes into the darkness after having for a 
moment represented, in the light of a flash, the people and God. 

This inexorable resolution so filled the air of June 6, 1832, that^ 
almost at the same hour, in the barricade of Saint Merry, the insur- 
gents raised this shout which was proved on the trial, and which has 
become historical : '‘Let them come to our aid or let them not come, 
what matter ? Let us die here to the last man.” 

As we' see, the two barricades, although essentially isolated, com- 
municated. 


rv 

FIVE LESS, ONE MORE 

After the man of the people, who decreed "the protest of corpses, 
had spoken and given the formula of the common soul, from all lips 
arose a strangely satisfied and terrible cry, funereal in meaning and 
triumphant in tone : 

"Long live death! Let us all stay!’' 

"Why all ?” said Enjolras. 

"All! all!” 

Enjolras resumed : 

"The position is good, the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough. 
Why sacrifice forty ?” 

They replied: • 

"Because nobody wants to go away.” 

"Citizens,” cried Enjolras, and there was in his voice almost an 
angry tremor, "the republic is not rich enough in men to incur useless 
expenditures. Vainglory is a squandering. If it is the duty of some 
to go away, that duty should be performed as well as any other.” 

Enjolras, the man of principle, had over his co-religionists th^t 
sort of omnipotence which emanates from the absolute. Still, not- 
withstanding this omnipotence, there was a murmur. 

Chief to his finger-ends, Enjolras, seeing that they murmured,, 
insisted. He resumed haughtily : 

"Let those who fear to be one of but thirty, say so.” 

The murmurs redoubled. 

"Besides,” observed a voice from one of the groups, "to go away 
is easily said. The barricade is hemmed in,” 

"Not towards the markets,” said Enjolras. "The Rue Mondetour

your pride, oh, God, they will be hungry ! What would you have me 
say to you ? There is a market for human flesh ; and it is not with your 
shadowy hands, fluttering about them, that you can prevent them 
from entering it ! Think of the street, think of the pavement covered 
with passers, think of the shops before which women walk to and fro 
with bare shoulders, through the mud. Those women also have been 
pure. Think of your sisters, those who have them. Misery, prosti- 
tution, the sergents de ville. Saint Lazare, such will be the fall of 
those delicate beautiful girls, those fragile wonders of modesty, 
grace, and beauty, fresher than the lilacs of the month of May. Ah ! 
you are killed ! ah ! you are no longer with theih ! Very well ; you 
desired to deliver the people from monarchy, you give your maidens 
to the police. Friends, beware, have compassion. Women, hapless 
women, are not in the habit of reflecting much. We boast that women 
have not received the education of men, we prevent them from read- 
ing, we prevent them from thinking, we prevent them from^ inter- 
esting themselves in politics ; will you prevent them from going to- 
night to the Morgue and identifying your corpses ? Come, those who 
have families must be good fellows and give us a grasp of the hand 
and go away, and leave us to the business here all alone. I know well 
that it requires courage to go, it is difficult ; but the more difficult it 
is, the more praiseworthy. You say: I have a musket, I am at the 
barricade, come the worst, I stay. Come the worst, that is very soon 
said. My friends, there is a morrow ; you will not be here on that 
morrow, but your families will. And what suffering ! See, a pretty,' 
healthy child that has cheeks like an apple, that babbles, that prattles, 
that jabbers, that laughs, that smells sweet under the kiss, do you 
know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I saw one, very 
small, no taller than that. His father was dead. Some poor people 
had taken him in from charity, but they had no bread for them- 
selves, The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry. 
They saw him go Up to the stove where there was never any fire, and 
the pipe of which, you know, was plastered with yellow clay. The 
child picked off some of that clay with his little fingers and ate it. 
His breathing was hard, his face livid, his legs soft, his belly big. 
Fie said nothing. They spoke to him, he did not answer. He died. 
He was brought to the Necker Hospital to die, where I saw him. I 
was surgeon at that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among 
you, fathers whose delight it is to take a walk on Sunday holding in 
their great strong hand the little hand of their child, let each of those 
fathers imagine that that child is his own. That poor bird, I remem- 
ber him well, it seems to me that I see him now, when he lay naked 
upon the dissecting table, his ribs projecting under his skin like 
graves under the grass of a church-yard. We found a kind of mud 
in his stomach, There were ashes in his teeth. Come, let us search 
our conscience and take counsel with our hearts. Statistics show that

stirred, 

“Married luen and supisirts nf families, out of the ranks!" re&gt; 
prated Marius. 

His auilinriiy was great. Knjoira* was indeed the chief of the 
barrirade, hut Marius was its saviour. 

"I order il.” cried Knjolms. 

“I brsceeh you." said M-irius. 

Then, ruus^ hy the words of Cuntbeferre, shaken bg die order

of Enjolras, moved by the prayer of Marius, those neroic men be- 
gan to inform against each other, “lhat is true,’' said a young man 
to a middle-aged man. “You are the father of a family. Go away.” 
“It is you rather,” answered the man, “you have two sisters, whom 
you support.” And an unparalleled conflict broke out* It was as to 
which should not allow himself to be laid at the door of the tomb. 

“Make haste,” said Courfeyrac, “in a quarter of an hour it will 
be too late.” 

“Citizens,” continued Enjolras, “this is the republic, and universal 
suffrage reigns. Designate yourselves those who ought to go.” 

. They obeyed. In a few minutes five were unanimously designated 
and left the ranks. 

“There are five !” exclaimed Marius. 

There were only four uniforms. 

“Well,” resumed the five, “one must stay.” 

And it was who should stay, and who should find reasons why 
the others should not stay. The generous quarrel recommenced. 

“You, you have a wife who loves you.” “As for you, you have 
your old mother.” “You have neither father nor mother, what wiU 
become of your three little brothers?” “You are the father of five 
children.” “You have a right to live, you are seventeen, it is. too 
soon.” 

These grand revolutionary barricades were rendezvous of hero- 
isms. The improbable there was natural. These men were not as- 
tonished at each other. 

“Be quick,” repeated Courfeyrac. 

Somebody cried out from the group, to Marius : 

“Designate yourself, which must stay.” 

“Yes,”, said the five, “choose. We will obey you.” 

Marius now believed no emotion possible. Still at this idea : to 
select a man for death, all his blood jfiowed back towards his heart. 
He would have turned pale if he could have been paler. 

He advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each, 
his eye full of that grand flame which we see in the depth of history 
over the Thermopylaes, cried to him : 

“Me ! me ! me !” 

And Marius, in a stupor, counted them ; there were still five ! Then 
his eyes fell upon the four unif ornis. 

At this moment a fifth uniform dropped, as if from heaven, upon 
the four others. 

The fifth man was saved. 

Marius raised his eyes and saw M. Fauchel event, 

Jean Valjean had just entered the barricade. 

Whether by information obtained, or by instinct, or by chance, 
he came by thejittle Rue Mondetour. Thanks to his National Guard 
dress, he had passed easily.

passing of ,a gust ; places where death is have such tripodal effects. 
There came from his eyes, full of the interior sight, a kind of stifled 
fire. Suddenly he raised his head, his fair hair waved backwards like 
that of the angel upon his sombre car of stars, it was the mane of a 
startled lion flaming with a halo, and Enjolras exclaimed : 

‘"Citizens, do you picture to yourselves the future ? The streets 
of the cities flooded with light, green branches upon the thresholds, 
the nations sisters, men just, the old men blessing the children, the 
past loving the present, thinkers in full hberty, believers in full 
equality, for religion the heavens; God priest direct, human con- 
science become the altar, no more hatred, the fraternity pf the Work- 
shop and the school, for reward and for penalty notoriety, to all, 
labour, for all, law, over all, peace, no more bloodshed, no more 
war, mothers happy! To subdue matter is the first step; to realise 
the ideal is the second. Reflect upon what progress has already done. 
Once the early human races looked with terror upon the hydra which 
blew upon the waters, the dragon which vomited fire, the griffin, 
monster of the air, which flew with the wings of an eagle and the 
claws of a tiger ; fearful animals which were above man. Man, how- 
ever, has laid his snares, the sacred snares of intelligence, and has at 
last caught the monsters. We have, tamed the hydra, and he is called 
the steamer ; we have tamed the dragon, and he is called the loco- 
motive; we are on the point of taming the griffin, we have him al- 
ready, and he is called the balloon. The day when this promethean 
work shall be finished, and when man shall have definitely harnessed 
to his will the triple chimera of the ancients, the hydra, the dragon, 
and the griffin, he will be the master of the water, the fire, and the 
air, and he will be to the rest of the animated creation what the an- 
cient gods were formerly to him. Courage, and forward! Citizens, 
whither are we tending? To science made government, to the force 
of things, recognised as the only i&gt;ublic force, to the natural law 
having its sanction and its penalty in itself and promulgated by its 
self-evidence, to a dawn of truth, cor-responding with the dawn of 
the day. We are tending towards the union of the peoples ; we are 
tending towards the unity of man. No more fictions ; no more para- 
sites. The real governed by the true, such is the aim. Civilisation 
will hold its courts on the summit of Europe, and later at the centr^ 
of the continents, in a grand parliament of intelligence. Something 
like this has been seen already. The Amphictyons had two sessions a 
year, one at Delphi, place of the gods, the other at Thermopylae, place 
of the heroes. Europe will have her Amphictyons ; the globe will have 
its Amphictyons. France bears within her the sublime future. This 
is the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which was sketched 
by Greece is worth being finished by France. Listen to me, then, 
Feuilly, valiant working-man, man of the people, man of the peoples. 
I venerate thee. Yes, thou seest clearly future ages ; yes, thou art

star; the soul will gravitate about 'the truth like the star about the 
light. Friends, the hour in which we live, and in which I speak to 
you, is a gloomy hour, but of such is the terrible price of the future. 
A revolution is a toll-gate. Oh ! the human race shall be delivered, 
uplifted, and consoled ! We affirm it on this barricade. Whence shall 
arise the shout of love, if it be not from the summit of sacrifice? O 
my brothers, here is the place of junction between those who think 
and those who suffer; this barricade is made neither of paving- 
stones, nor of timbers, nor of iron; it is made of two mounds, a 
mound of ideas and a mound of sorrows. Misery here encounters 
the ideal. Here day embraces night, and says : I will die with thee 
and thou shalt be born again with me.' From the pressure of all 
desolations faith gushes forth. Sufferings bring their agony here, 
and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are to 
mingle and compose our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in 
the radiance of the future, and we are entering a grave illuminated 
by the dawii.’' \ 

Enjolras broke off rather than ceased, his lips moyed noiselessly, 
as if he were continuing to speak to himself, and they looked at him 
with attention, endeavouring still to hear. There was no applause ; 
but they whispered for a long time. Speech being breath, the rust-^ 
ling of intellects resembles the rustling of leaves.

MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONIC 

Let us tell what was passing in Marius* thoughts. 

Remember the condition of his mind. As we have just mentioned, 
all was now to him a dream. His understanding was troubled. Mar- 
ius, we must insist, was under the shadow of the great black wings 
which open above the dying. He felt that he had entered the tomb; ■ 
it seemed to him that he was already on the other side of the wall, 
and he no longer saw the faces of the living save with the eyes of 
one dead. 

How came M. Fauchelevent there? Why was he there ? What did" 
he come to do ? Marius put done of these questions. Besides, our 
despair having this peculiarity that it enwraps others as wdl as 
ourselves, it seemed logical to him that everybody should come to 
die. 

Only he thought of Cosette with an oppression of the heart. 

Moreover M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at 
him, and had not even the appearance of hearing him when Marius 
said : I know him. 

As for Marius, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent was a relief to 
him, and if we might employ such a word: for such :inipfesiqns,;W

THE SITUATION GROWS SERIOUS 

It was gtowing light rapidly. But not a window was opened, not a 
door stood ajar ; it was the dawn, not the hour of awakening. The ex- 
tremity of the Rue de la Chanvrerie opposite the barricade had been 
evacuated by the troops, as we have said ; it seemed free, and. lay open 
for wayfarers with an ominous tranquillity. The Rue Saint Denis 
was as silent as the avenue of the Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living 
being at the corners, which were whitening in a reflection of the sun. 
Nothing is so dismal as this brightness of deserted streets. 

They saw nothing, but they heard. A mysterious movement was 
taking place at some distance. It was evident that the critical, mo- 
ment. was at hand. As in the evening the sentries were driven in 
but this' time all. 

The barricade was stronger than at the time of the first attack.. 
Since the departure of the five, it had been raised still higher. 

On the report of the sentry who had been observing the region 
of the markets, Enjolras, for fear of a surprise from the rear,, 
formed an irpportant resolution. He had barricaded the little pas- 
sage of the Rue Mondetour, which till then had been open. For this 
purpose they unpaved the length of a few more houses. In this way, 
the barricade, walled in upon three streets, in .front upon the Rue de 
la Chanvrerie, at the left upon the Rue du Cygne and la Petite Tru- 
anderie, at the right upon the Rue Mondetour, was really almost im- 
pregnable; it is true that they were fatally shut in. It had three 
fronts, but np longer an outlet. “A fortress, but mousetrap,” said 
Courfeyrac with a laugh, 

Enjolras had piled up near the door of the wine-shop some thirty 
paving-stones, *'torn up uselessly,” said Bossuet. 

The silence was now so profound on the side from which the at- 
tack must come, that Enjolras made each man resume his post for 
combat. 

A ration of brandy was distributed t.o all. 

Nothing is more singular than a barricade which is preparing 
for an assault. Each man chooses his place, as at a play. They lean 
on their sides, their elbows, their shoulders. There are some^who 
make themselves stalls with paving-stones. There is a corner of a 
wall which is annoying, they move away from it; here is a redan, 
which may be a protection, they take shelter in it. The left-handed 
are precious; they take places which are inconvenient for the rest. 
Many make arrangements to fight sitting down. They wish to be 
at their ease in killing, and comfortable in dying. In the deadly war 
of June, 1848, an insurgent, who had a terrible aim, and who fought 



1004 h K M I S K U A B I, i; S 

from the. top of n ti'rraee. on a roof, had a \'ollaire armchair carried 
ttp there; a charj-e of j»rai)f foiiinl him in it. 

As soon as the chief has onierefl tiie decks cleared for the fieht 
all disonlerly inovenients ceasi-; no inure skirmishing with one an- 
other; no nuire coteries; no more asides; no more standino’ apart" 
that which is in all minds eonvente.s, and changes into expectation 
of the assailant. A barricade before dangr-r, ehaos; in danger dis- 
cipline. IVrii prodnees order. ’ 

As soon ns l''.njnlras had taken his tlotihle-harrelled carbine, and 
placed himself on a kiiui of h;niiement which he hail reserved all 
were silent. A little dry .snapping sonnd was heard confusedly alone 
the wall of paving-stones, 'I hey were cocking their muskets. ^ 

Moreover, tlieir |iearm!&gt;' was lirnier and more cunfidcnt than 
ever: esee.ss of .sacritiee is a support ; they had Itope no longer but 
they had desptiir. i Sespair, I'maJ arm, whicli sometimes gives victory 
Virgil has .said so. .Supreme resources .spring front extreme reso- 
lutions. 'I'o enihark in &lt;lealh is sometimes the means of escaping a 
.sliijnvreek ; and the eol’fm-lid hreonifs a jdank of .safety. 

As on (lit* evening hefore, llie attention of all was turned, and we 
might alniost say threw its weie.hl upon the end of the street, now 
liglneil and visihle. 

'Idiev had tjot long to wait. Activity distinctly recommenced in 
tilt* direction .'saint l.en, hut it did not ji-aaiilile the movement of the 
first Jittaek. A rat tie of elrdiis, the menacing jolt of a mass, a clicking 
of !&gt;rass hounding over tfte pavement. ii sort of solemn uproar, an- 
Honneed tlial tm ominous body of iron was approadung. There was 
a shudder in the midst of those jM'aeefnl old .streets, cut through and 
built up for the fruit fnl eirentalion of interests and ideas, and which 
were not made for the moie li oiis nmthling of the wlieels of war. 

The stare of al the eomhatants njton tliu extremity of the street 
became wild. 

A piece of .u'l tilery appearetl. 

Tite gminers pushed forward the piece ; it wa.s all ready to k 
loadetl; llu* forewheels had been removed; tw‘o .supjiorted the car- 
riage, four were at the wheels, others followed with the caisson. 
The smoke of the hnrniiig match was seen, 

“Fire !‘* cried Fnjolnis, 

'rite whole harriejele rta-heil fire, the ex illusion was terrible; an 
avaliinehe »f smoke covered atid effaced the gttn and the men; ip a 
few seeotids the cloud dissipnted. and the eautton ami the men rfr 
Rjipeared ; those in charge of the piece placed it in position in front 
of the liarrirade. slowlv, correrlly, and without haste. Not a man had 
been touched. Then the gunner, bearing his weight on the breech, 
to elevate the range, began to point the cannon with the gravity of M 
aitmnomer adjusting a telescope. 

"Bravo for the gunners !*’ cried Bossuet. 



JEAN VALJEAN 1005 

And the whole barricade clapped hands. 

A moment afterwards, placed squarely in the very middle of the 
street, astride of the gutter, the gun was in battery. A formidable 
mouth was opened upon the barricade. 

"'Come, be lively !” said Courfeyrac. ‘"There is the brute. After the 
fillip, the knock-down. The army stretches out its big paw to us. 
The barricade is going to be seriously shaken. The musketry feels, 
the artillery takes.’’ 

“It is a bronze eight-pounder, new model,” added Combeferre. 
“Those pieces, however little they exceed the proportion of ten parts 
of tin to a hundred of copper, are liable to burst. The excess of tin 
makes them too tender. In that case they have hollows and chambers 
in the vent. To obviate this danger, and to be able to force out the 
load, it would be necessary, perhaps, to return to the process of the 
fourteenth century, hooping, and to strengthen the piece exteriorly, 
by a succession of steel rings unsoldered, from the breech to the 
trunnion. In the meanwhile, they remedy the defect as they can ; they 
find out where the holes and the hollows in the bore of a cannon 
are by means of a searcher. But there is a better way, that is the 
movable star of Gribeauval.” 

“In the sixteenth century,” observed Bossuet, “they rifled their 
cannon.” 

“Yes,” answered Combeferre, “that augments the balistic power, 
but diminishes the accuracy of the aim. In a short range, the tra- 
jectory has not the stiffness desirable, the parabola is exaggerated, 
the path of the projectile is, not rectilinear enough to permit it to hit 
the intermediate objects, a necessity of combat, however, the im- 
portance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and 
the rapidity of the firing. This want of tension in the curve of the 
projectile, in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century, is due to 
the feebleness of the charge ; feeble charges, for this kind of arm, 
are required by the necessities of balistics, such, as for instance, as 
the preservation of the carriages. Upon the whole, artillery, that 
despot, cannot do all it would ; strength is a great weakness. A can- 
non ball makes only two thousand miles an hour ; light makes two 
hundred thousand miles a second. Such is the superiority of Jesus 
Christ over Napoleon,” 

“Reload arms,” said Enjolras. 

How was the facing of the barricade going -to behave under fire? 
would the shot make a breach ? That was the question. While the 
insurgents were reloading their muskets, the gunners loaded the 
cannon. 

There was intense anxiety in the redoubt. 

The gun went off ; the detonation burst upon them. 

“Present!” cried a cheerful voice.

mind were dissipated. Did he know M. Fanchelevent's opinions? 
M. Fauchelevent was a i*epublican, perhaps. Hence his very natural 
presence in this conflict. 

Meanwhile Gavroche was already at the other end of the barri-’ 
cade, crying : ‘‘My musket V 

Courf eyrac ordered it to be given him. 

Gavroche warned his “comrades” as he called them, that the 
barricade was surrounded. He had had great difficulty in getting 
through. A battalion of the line, whose muskets were stacked, in. la 
Petite Truanderie, were observing the side on the Rue du Cygne ; 
on the opposite side the municipal guard occupied the Rue des 
Precheurs, In front, they had the'^bulk of the army. 

This inf ormation given, Gavroche added : 

“I authorise you to give them a dose of pills.” 

Meanwhile Enjolras, on his battlement, was watching, listening 
with intense attention. 

The assailants, dissatisfied doubtless with the effect of their fire, 
had not repeated it. 

A company of infantry of the line had come in and occupied the 
extremity of the street, in the rear of the gun. The soldiers tore up 
the pavement, and with the stones constructed a little low wall, a sort 
of breastwork, which was hardly more than eighteen inches high, 
and which fronted the barricade. At the corner on the left of this 
breastwork, they saw the head of the column of a battalion of the 
banlieue massed in the Rue St. Denis. 

Enjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar 
sound which is made when canisters of grape are taken from the 
caisson, and he saw the gunner change the aim and incline the piece 
slightly to the left. Then the cannoneers began to load. The gunner 
seized the linstock himself and brought it near the touch-holev 

“Heads down, keep close to the wall!” cried Enjolras, “and all 
on your knees along the barricade !” 

The insurgents, who were scattered in front of the wine-shop, 
and who had left their posts of combat on Gavroche's arrival, rushed 
pell-mell towards. the barricade; but before Enjolras’ order was 
executed, the discharge took place with the fearful rattle of grape- 
shot, It was so in fact. 

The charge was directed at the opening of the redoubt, it ricocheted 
upon the wall, and this terrible ricochet killed two men and wounded 
three. 

If that conittnued, the barricade was no longer tenable. It was not 
proof against grape. v 

There was a sound of consterfiation. 

“Let us prevent the second shot, at any rate,” said Enj olras. ' 

And, lowering his carbine, he aimed at the gunner, who, at ths&gt;*

JEANVALJEAN 1009 

At the order given by Enjolras, he got Up. ■ 

It will be remembered that on the arrival of the company in the 
Rue de la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing bullets, had put 
her mattress before her window. This window, a garret window, 
was on the roof of a house of six stories standing a little outside of 
the barricade. The mattress, placed crosswise, rested at the bottom 
upon two clothes-poles, and was sustained above by two ropes 
which, in the distance, seemed like threads, and which were fastened 
to nails driven into the window casing. These two ropes could be 
seen distinctly against the sky like hairs. 

‘‘Can somebody lend me a double-barrelled carbine?’’ said Jean 
Valjean. 

Enjolras, who had just reloaded his, handed it to him. 

Jean Valjean aimed at the window and fired. 

One of the two ropes of the mattress was cut. 

The mattress now hung only by one thread. 

Jean Valjean fired the second barrel. The second rope struck the 
glass of the window. The mattress slid. down between the two poles, 
and fell into the street. 

The barricade applauded. 

All cried : 

“There is a mattress.” 

“Yes,” said Combeferre, “but who will go after it?” 

The matti'ess had, in fact, fallen outside of the barricade, be^ 
tween the besieged and the besiegers. Now, the death of the gunner 
having exasperated the troops, the soldiers, for some moments, had 
been lying on their faces behind the line of paving-stones which they 
had raised, and, to make up for the compulsory silence of the gun, 
which was quiet while its service was being reorganised, they ha,d 
opened fire on the barricade. The insurgents made no response to 
this musketry, to spare their ammunition. The fusilade was broken 
against the barricade ; but the sti-eet, which it filled with balls, was 
terrible, 

Jean Valjean went out at the opening, entered the street, passed 
through the /&gt;torm of balls,) went to the mattress, picked it up, put it 
on his back, and returned to the barricade. 

He put the mattress into the opening himself. He fixed it against 
the wall in such a way that the artillerymen did not see it. 

This done, they awa.ited the charge of grape. 

They had not long to wait, 

The cannon vomited its package of shot with a roar. But there 
was no ricochet. The grape miscarried upon the mattress. The de- 
sired effect was obtained. The barricade was preserved. 

“Citizen,” said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, “the republic thanks 
you.” 

Bossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed :

At that moment C'osette awoke. 

Her room was .sinail. neat, retired, with a loiijf window to the 
east, looking npoti the hack-yard nt the house. 

tdsetle kliew noiliing of what was going on in ?.ari!3. She haj 
not ht'eii ont of her room in l!ie evening, and site had already with- 
drawn to it when ’rotissaiin saiil : "It appears tlmt there is a row.” 

t'oselie had slejil few iioiirs. Imt well. Slie iiatl had sweet dreams 
whiclt was partly owing jjerhaps to her little hed heing very white, 
Somcltotly who was M.arins had appeared to her .surrounded by a 
halo. Site awoke with the sun in her eyes, which at first produced 
Ihecd'cct of a coiiiinnatitin of her dream. 

Her lirst enioiion, on coming out of tins tircam, was joyous. 
Coseiie felt entirely reasstired. .'she \v;is passing through, as Jeaa 
\‘aljean had done a few hotns Itefore, that reaction of the soul 
which ahsohitely refuses woe. She Iwgait to hope with all her might 
wiiltoiit knowing why. Then came an oppre.ssion of the heart, 
“l iere were three rlays now llud .she had not .seen Marius, But she 
saiti to herself that lie must have received her letter, that he knew 
where she was, ami tliat he had .so much tact, tiuit he would find 
means to reach her." “And th.»t ct-rtainly to-day, and perhaps this 
very morning." "It was broad &lt;lay, hnt the rays of light were very 
hofi/onial, .she thonghi it was very early; that .she must get up, 
however, to receive Marins.'* 

,'she felt tlmt she conld not live wiihimt Marius, and that coo- 
seipietilly, that was enough, and iliaf Marins would come. No objec- 
tion was ndmissihle, All that was eert.tin. It was monstrous enough 
already to have sulTeretl three days. Mariu.s ahsent three days, it 
wa.H horrible in the gtssl fJiMl. Now this cruel sjxirt of Heaven was 
an ordeal tltat was over. .Marins was coming, and would bring good 
news, Thus is youth const it utetl; it i|iiickiy wiiars its eyes; it be- 
lieves sorrow useless ami does not accept it. Youth is the srtiile of 
the future Iwforc an unknown lieiug which is itself. It is natural 
tor it to lie happy. It seems as though it breathed liope. ^ . 

Hesiiles, t usetlc could not succeed in recalling what Marius bad 
said to her on the subject of this absence which was to hut but aw 
day, or what explaimtion be had given her about it, EveryWy 
has noticed with what address a piece of money which omI

undiscoverable. There are thoughts which play us the same trick ; 
they hide in a corner of our brain ; it is all over ; they are lost ; im- 
possible to put the memory back upon them. Cosette was a little 
vexed at the useless petty efforts which her recollection made. She 
said to herself that it was very naughty of her and very wicked to 
have forgotten words uttered by Marius. 

She got up and performed the two ablutions, of the soul and the 
body, her prayer and her toilette. 

We may, in extreme cases, introduce the reader into a nuptial 
chamber, not into a maiden’s chamber. Verse would hardly dare, 
prose ought not. 

It is the interior of a flower yet unblown, it is a whiteness in the 
shade, it is the inmost cell of a closed lily which ought not to be 
looked upon by man, while yet it has not been looked upon by the 
sun. Woman in the bud is sacred. The innocent bed which is thrown 
open, the adorable semi-nudity which is afraid of itself, the white 
foot which takes refuge in a slipper, the bosom which veils itself 
before a mirror as if that mirror were an eye; the chemise which 
hastens up to hide the shoulder at the snapping of a piece of fur- 
niture, or at the passing of a waggon, the ribbons tied, the clasps 
hooked, the lacings drawn, the starts, the shivers of cold and of 
modesty, the exquisite shyness in every movement, the almost 
winged anxiety where there is no cause for fear ; the successive 
phases of the dress as charming as the clouds of the dawn ; it is not 
fitting that all this should be described, and it is too much, indeed, 
to refer to it. 

The eye of man should be more religious still before the rising of 
a young maiden than before the rising of a star. The possibility of 
touch should increase respect. The down of peach, the dust of the 
plum, the radiated crystal of the snow, the butterfly’s wing powd- 
ered with feathers, are gross things in presence of that chastity which 
does not even know that it is chaste. The young maiden is only the 
gleam of a dream, and is not yet statue. Her alcove is hidden in the 
shadows of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of the eye defaces thisi 
dim penumbra. Here, to gaze is to profane. 

We will show nothing, then, of all that pleasant little confusion 
on Cosette’s awakening. 

An Eastern tale relates that the rose was made white by God, 
but that Adam having looked at it at the moment it was half opened, 
it was ashamed and blushed. We are of those who^feel themselves 
speechless before young maidens and flowers, finding them vener- 
able. 

Cosette dressed herself very quickly, combed and arranged her 
hair, which was a very simple thing at that time,* when women did 
not puff out their ringlets and plaits with cushions and rolls, and 
did not put crinoline in their hair. Then she opened the window and

alternated, without much damage indeed. The top of the fagade 
of Corinth alone sulfered; the window of the first story and the 
dormer windows on the roof, riddled with shot and ball, were slowly 
demolished. The combatants who were posted there, had to with- 
draw. Besides, this is the art of attacking barricades ; to tease for 
a long time, in order to exhaust the ammunition of the insurgents, 
if they commit the blunder of replying. When it is perceived, from 
the slackening of their fire, that they have no longer either balls 
or powder, the assault is made. Enjolras did not fall into this snare; 
the barricade did not reply. 

At each platoon fire, Gavroche thrust out his cheek with his 
tongue, a mark of lofty disdain : 

‘^That's right,’^ said he, ‘'tear up the cloth. We want lint.’’ 

Courfeyrac jested with the grape about its lack of effect, and said 
to the cannon: 

“You are getting diffuse, my goodman.” 

In a battle people force themselves upon acquaintance, as at a ball. 
It is probable that this silence of the redoubt began to perplex the 
besiegers, and make them fear some unlooked-for accident, and that 
they felt the need of seeing through that heap of paving-stones, 
and knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall, which 
was receiving their fire without answering it. The insurgents sud- 
denly perceived a casque shining in the sun upon a neighbouring 
roof. A sapper was backed up against a tall chimney, and seemed 
to be there as a sentinel. He looked directly into the barricade. 

“There is a troublesome overseer,” said Enjolras. 

Jean Valjean had returned his carbine to Enjolras, but he had 
his musket. 

“ Without saying a word, he aimed at the sapper, and, a second, 
afterwards, the casque, struck by a ball, fell noisily into the street. 
The startled soldier hastened to disappear. 

A second observer took his place. This was an officer. Jean Val- 
jean, who had reloaded his musket, aimed at the new comer, and 
sent the officer’s casque to keep company with the soldier’s. The 
officer was not obstinate, and withdrew very quickly. This time 
the warning was understood. Nobody appeared upon the roof again, 
and they gave up watching the barricade. 

“Why didn’t you kill the man?” asked Bossuet of Jean Valjean. 

Jean Valjean did not answer.

Bossuet murmured in Combeferre’s ear : 

“He has not answered my question.”

those Saint Simonians! and there was an attempt to kill him. Now, 
he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duke de Saint 
Simon. A National Guard had read upon this book the name: 
Saint Simon, and cried : "'Kill him.'’ 

On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of National Guards of the 
banlieue, commanded by Captain Fannicot, before mentioned, got 
themselves, through whim and for sport's sake, decimated in the 
Rue de la Chanvrerie. The fact, singular as it may seem, was proven 
by the judicial investigation entered upon after the insurrection 
of 1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a kind of 
condottiere of^ the order of those we have just characterised, a 
fanatical and insubordinate governmentalist, could not resist the 
impulse to open fire before the hour, and the ambition of taking 
the barricade by himself all alone, that is, with his company. Ex- 
asperated by the successive appearance of the red flag and the old 
coat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed the generals 
and chiefs of corps, who were holding counsel, and did not deem 
that the moment for the decisive assault had come, and were leav- 
ing, according to a celebrated expression of one of them, ‘‘the in- 
surrection to cook in its own juice." As for him, he thought the 
barricade ripe, and, as what is ripe ought to fall, he made the at- 
tempt. 

He commanded men as resolute as himself, “madmen," said a wit- 
ness. Flis company, the same which had shot the poet Jean Prou- 
vaire, was the first of the battalion posted at the corner of the 
street. At the moment when it was least expected, the captain hurled 
his men against the barricade. This movement, executed with more 
zeal than strategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had 
passed over two-thirds of the street, it was greeted by a general dis- 
charge from the barricade. Fctir, the most daring, who were run- 
ning in advance, were shot down at the muzzles of the muskets, at 
the very foot of the redoubt ; and this -courageous mob of National 
Guards, very brave men, but who had no military tenacity, had to 
fall back, after some hesitation, leaving fifteen dead upon the pave- 
ment. The moment of hesitation gave the insurgents time to reload^ 
and a second discharge, very murderous, reached the company be- 
fore it was able to regain the corner of the street, its shelter. At one 
moment it was taken -between two storms of balls, and it received 
the volley of the piece in battery which, receiving no orders, had not 
discontinued its fire. The intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one 
of the killed by this volley. He was slain by the cannon, that is to 
say, by order. 

This attack, more furious than serious, irritated Enjolras-. 

“The fools!" said he. “They are getting their men killed and 
using up our ammunition, for nothing.” 

Enjolras spoke like the true general of emeute that he was. In-

In the chaos of Mmlimmis and pie-sioiis which defend a barricade, 
there is something of evn vihing ; iheie is hravt^ry, yentth, honour, 
cullmsiasm, the ideal, conviction, the eager fury of the gamester, 
Biiti uhove all. inlia vals of hope. 

(hte of those intervals, one of those vague thrills of hope, sud- 
denly crosscti, at the most tiiie\{M‘ctt a| moment, the barricade of 
the Ktie dc la llianvrerie. 

"Hark!" aUriiplly cxclainual Ihijolras, who was constantly on 
the alert, "it seems io me ih.il Paris is waking." 

It is certain that on the tnoining of the (Hh of June the insur- 
rection iiad, for an hour or two, a cerl.iiii recnttlc-sccnce. The ob- 
stinacy of the tirsin of Saint Merry teaiiimaied some dull hopes.

threw upon the troops, from the roofs, old fragments of household 
vessels and utensils ; a bad sign ; and when this fact was reported 
to Marshal Soult, the old lieutenant of Napoleon grew thoughtful, 
remembering the saying of Suchet at Saragossa : ‘We are lost when 
the old women empty their pots upon our he ads 

These general symptoms which were manifested just when it was 
supposed the emeute was localised, this fever of wrath which was 
regaining the upper hand, these sparks which flew here and there 
above those deep masses of combustible material which are called 
the Fauboui'gs of Paris, all taken together rendered the military 
chiefs anxious. They hastened to extinguish these beginnings of con- 
flagration. They delayed, until these sparks should be quenched, 
the attack on the barricades Maubuee, de la Chanvrerie, and Saint 
Merry, that they might ’have them only to deal with, and might 
be able to finish all at one blow. Columns were thrown into the 
streets in fermentation, sweeping the large ones, probing the small 
on the right, on the left, sometimes slowly and with precaution, 
sometimes at a double quick step. The troops beat in the doors of 
the houses from which there had been firing ; at the same time ma- 
noeuvres of cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This 
repression was not accomplished without lioise, nor without that 
tumultuous uproar peculiar to shocks between the army and the' 
people. This was what Enjolras caught, in the intervals of the can- 
nonade and the musketry. Besides, he had seen some wounded 
passing at the end of the street upon litters, and said to Courf eyrac : 
^^Those wounded do not come from our fire.'^ 

The hope did not last long ; the gleam was soon eclipsed. In less 
than half an hour that which was in the air vanished ; it was like 
heat lightning, and the insurgents felt that kind of leaden pall fall 
upon them which the indifference of the people casts over the wil- 
ful when abandoned. 

The general movement, which seemed to have been vaguely pro- 
jected, had miscarried; and the attention of the Minister of War 
and the strategy of the generals could now be concentrated upon 
the three or four barricades remaining standing. 

The sun rose above the horizon. 

An insurgent called to Enjolras : 

‘'We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this without 
eating?'’ 

Enjolras, still leaning upon his battlement, without taking his 
eyes off the extremity of the street, nodded his head. 

XIV 

• IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS^ MISTRESS 
CouRFEYRAC, Seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, continued 
his insults to the cannon, and every time that that gloomy cloud of 




JEAN VALJEAN 1019 

was calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper 
ridge of the barricade, dismantled it, and crumbled the paving- 
stones over the insurgents in showers. 

^ This peculiar aim was intended to drive the combatants from the 
summit of the redoubt, and to force them to crowd together in the 
interior, that is, it announced the assault. 

The combatants once driven from the top of the barricade by the 
balls and from the windows of the wine-shop by the grape, the at- 
tacking columns could venture into the street without being watched, , 
perhaps even without being under fire, suddenly scale the redoubt, 
as on the evening before, and, who knows ? take it by surprise. 

*'We must at all events diminish the inconvenience of those 
pieces,” said Enjolras, and he cried: ‘^fire upon the cannoneers !” 

All were ready. The barricade, which had been silent for a long 
time, opened fire desperately; seven or eight discharges succeeded 
each other with a sort of rage and joy; the street was filled with a 
blinding smoke, and after a few minutes, through this haze pierced 
by flame, they could confusedly make out two thirds of the can- 
noneers lying under the wheels of the guns. Those who remained 
standing continued to serve the pieces with rigid composure, but 
the fire was slackened. 

^‘This goes well,” said Bossuet to Enjolras. ‘‘Success.” 

Enjolras shook his head and answered : 

“A quarter of an hour more of this success, and there will not be 
ten cartridges in the barricade.” 

It would seem that Gavroche heard this remark. 

XV ' . 

GAVROCHE OUTSIDE 

CouRFEYRAC Suddenly perceived somebody at the foot of the bar- 
ricade, outside in the street, under the balls. 

Gavroche had taken a basket from the wine-shop, had gone out 
by the opening, and was quietly occupied in emptying into his 
basket the full cartridge-boxes of the National Guards who had been 
killed on the slope of the redoubt. ^ 

“What are you doing there?” said Courfeyrac. 

Gavroche cocked up his nose. 

“Citizen, I am filling my basket.” 

“Why. don’t you see the grape?” 

Gavroche answered : 

“Well, it rains. What then?” 

Courfeyrac cried : 

“Comeback!”

On est laid a Nanterre, 

Cest la faute a Voltaire, 

Et bete a Palaiseau, 

C’est la faute a Rousseau. 

Then he picked up his basket, put into it the cartridge which had 
fallen out, without losing a single one, and, advancing towards the 
fusilade, began to empty another cartridge-box. There a fourth ball 
just missed him again. Gavroche sang: 

Je ne suis pas notaire, 

C’est la faute a Voltaire ; 

Je suis petit oiseau, 

Gest la faute a Rousseau. 

A hfth ball succeeded only in drawing a third couplet from him , 

Joie est mon caractere, 

Cest la faute k Voltaire ; 

Misere est mon trousseau, 

C’est la faute a Rousseau. 

. This continued thus for some time. 

The sight was appalling and fascinating. Gavroche, fired at, 
mocked the firing. He appeared to be very much amused. It was the 
sparrow pecking at the hunters. He replied to each discharge by a 
couplet. They aimed at him incessantly, they always missed hirri. 
The National Guards and the soldiers laughed as they aimed at him. 
He lay down, then rose up, hid himself in a doorway, then sprang 
out, disappeared, reappeared, escaped, returned, retorted upon the 
volleys by wry faces, and meanwhile pillaged cartridges, emptied 
cartridge-boxes, and filled his basket. The insurgents, breathless 
with anxiety, followed him with their, ej^es. The, barricade was 
trembling ; he was singing. It was not a child ; it was not a man ; it 
was a strange fairy gamin. One would have said the invulnerable 
dwarf of the melee. The bullets ran after him, he was more nimble 
than they. He was playing an indescribably terrible game of hide- 
and-seek with death; every time the fiat-nosed face of the spectre 
approached, the gamin snapped his fingers. 

One bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the 
others, reached the Will-o'-the-wisp child. They saw Gavroche 
totter, then he fell. The whole barricade gave a cry ; but there was an 
Antaeus in this pigmy; for the gamin to touch the pavement is like 
the giant touching the earth ; Gavroche had fallen only to rise again ; 
he sat up, a long stream of blood rolled down his face, he raised 
both arms in air, looked in the direction whence the shot came, and 
began to sing:

JEAN VALJEAN 1023 

It required the commotion of such a day for these little out- 
casts to be in this garden. If the officers had noticed them, they 
would have driven away these rags. Poor children cannot enter the 
public gardens ; still one would think that, as children, they had a 
right in the flowers. 

^ These were th/^re, thanks to the closed gates. They were in viola- 
tion of the rules. They had slipped into the garden, and they had 
stayed there. Closed gates do not dismiss the keepers, the over-&lt; 
sight is supposed to continue, but it is relaxed and at its ease ; and 
the keepers, also excited by the public anxiety and busier with mat- 
ters without than within, no longer paid attention to the garden,^ 
and had not seen the two delinquents. 

• It had rained the night before, and even a little that morning. 
But in June showers are of no account. It is with difficulty that we 
can realise, an hour after a storm, that this fine fair day has been 
rainy. The ground in summer is as soon dry as the cheek of a child 
At this time of the solstice, the light of the full moon is, so to 
speak, piercing. It seizes upon everything. It applies itself and 
spreads itself over the earth with a sort of suction. One would say 
that the sun was thii*sty. A shower is a glass of water; a rain is 
swallowed immediately. In the morning all is streaming, in the 
afternoon all is dusty. 

Nothing is so admirable as a verdure washed by the rain and 
wiped by the sunbeam ; it is warm freshness. The gardens and the 
meadows, having water at their roots and sunshine in their flowers, 
become vases of incense, and exhale all their perfumes at once. 
All these laugh, sing, and proffer themselves. We feel sweet intoxi- 
cation. Spring is a provisional paradise; sunshine helps to make man 
patient. 

There, are people who ask nothing more ; h’ving beings who, hav- 
ing the blue sky, say : ‘Tt is enough!” dreamers absorbed in marvel, 
drawing from idolatry of nature an indifference to good and evil, 
contemplators of the cosmos radiantly diverted from man, who do 
not understand how anybody can busy himself with the hunger 
of these, with the thirst of those,, with the nakedness of the poor 
in winter, with the lymphatic curvature of a little backbone, with 
the pallet, with the garret,, with the dungeon, and with the rags of 
shivering little girls, when he might dream under the trees ; peaceful 
and terrible souls^ pitilessly content. A strange thing, the infinite 
is enough for them. This great need of man, the finite, which ad- 
mits of embrace, they ignore. The finite which admits of progress, 
sublime toil, they do not think of. The indefinitej, which is 
born of the combination human and divine, of the infinite and the 
finite, escapes them. Provided they are face to face with immensity, 
they smile. Never joy, always ecstasy. To lose themselves is their 
life. The* history of humanity tOi them is. only a £ragm«^ntary plan;

All is not there, the true All is still heytnid ; what is the use of busy-

The zodiac has such success with diem that it prevents them from

there are cloutls of purple and gold above their beads, declare them- 
selves content, and who are determined to be happy until the light

We shouhl admire and pity them, as wt‘ would pity and admire a

In the intlirt'erence of tliese thinkers, aceuialing to some, lies a 
superior philo.sophy. So he it; hut in this superiority there is some 
infirmity. One nmy be iminorttil :ind a crii'ple ; Vulcan for instance. 
One may be more than man tint! less than man. The immense incom-

On the 6th June, 1832, towards eleven oVlock in the morning, 
the T.tixemhourg. solit.ary and uiipenpleti, was delightful. The 
quiiicunxes and the jiartevres projected themselves into the light in 
balms and dazzlings. 'fhe branches, wild witli the noonday brilliance, 
seemed seeking lo enihrace each other. 'I’hen; was in the sycamores 
a diatlering of linnets, tlie sparrows were jultilanl, the wood]ieckers 
elimiied up thehorse-cliestmits, tapping with tlieir beaks the wrinkles

empurpled, and kindled the tulips, which are nothing more nor less 
than all varieties of flame made flowers. All about the tulip beds 
whirled the bees, sparks from these flame-flowers. All was grace 
and gaiety, even the coming rain ; that old offender, by whom the 
hone;^suckles and the lilies of the valley would profit, produced no 
disquiet; the swallows flew low, charming menace. He who was 
there breathed happiness; life was sweet; all this nature exhaled 
candour, help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts 
which fell from the sky were as soft as the child’s little hand which 
you kiss. 

The statues under the trees, bare and white, had robes of shade 
torn by light ; these goddesses were all tattered by the sunshine ; it 
hung from them in shreds on all sides. Around the great basin, the 
earth was already so dry as to be almost baked. There was wind 
enough to raise here and there little emeutes of sand. A few yellow 
leaves, relics of the last autumn, chased one another joyously, and 
seemed to be playing tjhe gamn. 

The abundance of l%ht was inexpressibly comforting. Life, sap, 
warmth, odour, overflowed ; you felt beneath creation the enormity 
of its source; in all these breezes saturated with love, in this com- 
ing and going of reflections and reverberations, in this prodigious 
expenditure of rays, in this indefinite outlay of fluid gold, you felt 
the prodigality^ of the inexhaustible ; and behind this splendour, as 
behind a curtain of flame, you. caught a glimpse of God, the mil- 
lionaire of stars. 

Thanks to the sand, there was not a trace of mud ; thanks to the 
rain, there was not a speck of dust. The bouquets had just been 
washed ; all the velvets, all the satins, all the enamels, all the golds, 
which spring from the earth in the form of flowers, were irre- 
proachable. This magnificence was tidy. The great silence of happy 
nature filled the garden. A celestial silence compatible with a 
thousand melodies, cooings of nests, hummings of swarms, pal- 
pitations of the wind. All the harmony of the season was accom- 
plished in a graceful whole; the entrances and exits of spring took 
place in the desired order; the lilacs ended, the jessamines began; 
some flowers were belated, some insects in advance ; the vanguard 
of the red butterflies of June fraternised with the rearguard of the 
white butterflies of May. The plane-trees were getting a new skin. 
The breeze scooped out waves in the magnificent vastness of the 
horse-chestnuts. It was resplendent. A veteran of the adjoining 
barracks, looking through the grating, said: “There is spring under 
arms, and in full dress.” 

All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; it was the 
hour ; the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green 
cloth over the earth ; the sun shone d giorno. God was serving up the 
universal rqjast. Every creature had its food' or its fodder. The ring-

love pomp. Never am I seen with coats bedizened with gold and 
gems ; I leave this false splendour to badly organised minds.” 

Here the deep sounds, which came from the direction of the mar- 
kets, broke out with a redoubling of bell and of uproar. 

“What is that ?” inquired the child. 

The father answered : 

“They are saturnalia.” 

Just then he noticed the two little ragged fellows standing motion- 
less behind the green cottage of the swans. 

“There is the beginning,” said he. 

And after a moment, he added : 

“Anarchy is entering this garden.” 

Meanwhile the son Ht the bun, spit it out, and suddenly began to 
cry. 

“What are you crying for?” asked the father. 

“I am not hungry any more,” said the child. 

The father’s smile grew broad. 

“You don’t need to be hungry, to eat a cake.” 

“I am sick of my cake. It is stale.” 

“You don’t want any more of it ?” 

“No.” 

The father showed him the swans. 

“Throw it to those palmipeds.” 

The child hesitated. Not to want'any more of one’s cake, is no 
reason for giving it away. 

The father continued : 

“Be humane. We must take pity on the animals.” 

And, taking the cake from his son, he threw it into the basin. 

The cake fell near the edge. 

The swans were at a distance, in the centre of the basin, and busy 
with' some prey. They saw neither the bourgeois nor the bun. 

The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being lost, 
and arou.sed by this useless shipwreck, devoted himself to a tele- 
graphic agitation which finally attracted the attention of the swans. 

They perceived something floating, veered about like the ships 
they are, and directed themselves slowly towards the bun with that 
serene majesty which is fitting to white animals. 

“Cygnes [swans] understand [signs],” said the bourgeois, 

delighted at his wit, 

Jiust then the distant tumult in the city suddenly increased again. 
This time it was ominous. There are some gusts &lt;sf wind that speak 
more distinctly than others. That which blew at that moment brought 
clearly the rolls of drums, shouts, platoon firing, and the dismal 
replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This was coincident with a bladt 
cloud which abruptly shut out the sun. 

The swans had not yet rwched the bun. 



1028 LESMISERABLES 

“Come home/' said the father, “they are attacking the Tuileries '' 

He seized his son’s hand again. Then he continued : 

“From the Tiiileries to the Luxembourg, there is only the distance 
which separates royalty from the peerage ; it is not far. It is ffoinp* 
TO rain musket-balls." ^ ^ 

He looked at the cloud. 

“And perhaps also the rain itself is going to rain; the heavens 
are joining in; the younger branch is condemned. Come home 
quick." 

“I should like to see the swans eat the bun," said the child. 

The father answered : 

“That would be an imprudence." 

And he led away his little bourgeois. 

The son, regretting the swans, turned his head towards the basin, 
until a turn in the rows of trees hid it from him. 

Meanwhile, at the same time with the swans, the two little wan- 
derers had approached the bun. It was floating on the water. The 
smaller was looking at the cake, the larger was looking at the bour- 
geois who was going away. 

The father and the son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads 
to the grand stairway of the cluster of trees on the side towards 
the Rue Madame. 

As soon as they were out of sight, the elder quickly lay down with 
his face over the rounded edge of the basin, and, holding by it with 
his left hand, hanging over the water, almost falling in, with his 
right hand reached his stick towards the cake. The swans, seeing the 
enemy, made haste, and in making haste produced an effect with 
their breasts which was useful to the little fisher; the water flowed 
back before the swans, and one of those smooth concentric waves 
pushed the bun gently towards the child’s stick.* As the swans came 
up, the stick touched the cake. The child made a quick moverhent, 
drew in the bun, frightened the swans, seized the cake, and got up. 
The cake was soaked ; but they were hungry and thirsty. The eldest 
broke the bun into two pieces, one large and one small, took the small 
one for himself, gave the large one to his little brother, and said to 
him: 

^^Stick that in your gtm!*

MORTUUS PATER FItIUM MORITURXJM EXPECTAT 

Marius had sprung out of the barricade. Combeferre had followed 
him. But it was too late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought 
back the baskefbf cartridges ; Marius brought back the child. 
“Alas !" thought he, “what the father load done for his father he 



JEANVALjfiAN 102,9 

was returning to the son ; only Thenardier had brought back his 
father living, while he brought back the child dead.” 

When Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, 
his face, like the child’s, was covered with blood. 

Just as he had stooped down to pick up Gavroche, a ball grazed 
his skull ; he did not perceive it. 

Courfeyrac took off his cravat and bound up Marius’ forehead. 

They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and they 
stretched the black shawl over the two bodies. It was large enough 
for the old man and the child. 

Combe ferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he 
had brought back. 

This gave each man fifteen shots. 

Jean Valjean was still at the same place, motionless upon his 
block. When Combeferre presented him his fifteen cartridges, he 
shook his head. 

“There is a rare eccentric,” said Combeferre in a low tone to En- 
jolras. “He finds means not to fight in this barricade.” 

“Which does not prevent him from defending it,” answered En- 
jolras. 

“Heroism has its originals,” replied Combeferre. 

And Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added : 

“He is a different kind from Father Mabeuf.” 

A notable fact, the fire which was battering the barricade hardly 
disturbed the interior. Those who have never passed through the 
whirlwind of this kind of war can have no idea of the singular mo- 
ments of tranquillity which are mihgled with these convulsions. 
Men come and go, they chat, they joke, they lounge. An acquaint- 
ance of ours heard a combatant say to him in the midst of the grape : 
This is like a bachelor’s breakfast. The redoubt in the Rue de la 
Chanvrerie, we repeat, seemed very calm within. Every turn and 
every phase of fortune had been or would soon be exhausted. The 
position from critical had become threatening, and from threatening 
was probably becoming desperate. In proportion as the condition 
of affairs grew gloomy the heroic gleam empurpled the barricade 
more and more. Enjolras, grave, commanded it, in the attitude of a 
young Spartan devoting his drawn sword to the sombre genius 
Epidotas. ' 

Combeferre, with apron at his waist, was dressing the wounded; 
Rosscut and Feuilly were making cartridges with the flask of pow- 
der taken by Gavroche from the dead corjDoral, and Bossuet said to 
Feuilly : We shall soon take the diligence for another planet; Cour- 
feyrac, ujjon the few paving-stones which he had reserved for him- 
self near Enjolras, was disposing and arranging a whole arsenal, 
his sword-cane, his musket, two horse-pistols, and a pocket pistol, 
with the care of a girl who is putting a little work-box in order.

JEAN VALJEAN 1031 

“Carry some paving-stones into the house. Fortify the windows 
with them. Half the men to the muskets, the other half to the stones. 
Not a minute to lose.” 

A platoon of sappers, their axes on their shoulders, had just ap- 
peared in order of battle at the end of the street. 

This could only be the head of a column ; and of what column? 
The column of attack, evidently. The sappers, whose duty it is to 
demolish the barricade, must always precede the soldiers whose duty 
't is to scale it. 

They were evidently close upon the moment which Monsieur de 
i^lermont Tonnerre, in 1822, called “the twist of the necklace.” 

Enjolras’ order was executed with the correct haste peculiar to 
ships and barricades, the only places of combat whence escape is 
impossible. In less than a minute, two-thirds of the paving-stones 
which Enjolras had had piled up at the door of Corimh were carried 
up to the fir.st story and to the garret ; and before a second minute 
had elap.sed, these .stones, artistically laid one upon another, walled 
up half the height of the window on the first story and the dormer 
windows of the Jittic. A few openings, carefully arranged by Feuilly, 
chief builder, allowed musket barrels to pass through. This arma- 
ment of the window.s could be performed the more easily since the 
grape had ceased. The two pieces were now firing balls upon the 
centre of the wall, in order to make a hole, and if it were possible, a 
breach for the assault. 

When the paving-stones, destined for the last defence, were in 
position, Enjolras had them carry up to the first story the bottles 
which he had place&lt;l under the table where Mabeuf was. 

“Who will drink tliat ?_” Bossuet asked him. 

“They,” answered Enjolras. 

Then they barricaded the basement window, an&lt;l they held in 
readiness the iron crtiss-pieee.s which served to bar the door of the 
wine-shop on the inside at night. 

The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the 
wine-shop was the donjon. 

With tile p;ivlng-sti)nes which remained, they closed up the open- 
ng beside the barricade. 

As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to husband 
their ammunition, and as tlie besiegers know it, the besi(^ers per- 
fect their arrangements with a sort of provoking leisure, expose 
themselves to fife before the time, but in appearance more than in 
reality, and take their ease. The preparations for attack are always 
made with a certain methodical slowness, after which, the thunder- 
bolt. 

This slswraeas allowed Enjolras to look over the whole, and to 
perfect the whole. He felt that since sudi man were to die, their 
death should be a masterpitce. 



1032 LES MISERABLES 

He said to Marius: “We are the two chiefs; I will give the last 
orders within. You stay outside and watch.” 

Marius posted himself for observation upon the crest of the bar- 
ricade. 

Enjoiras had the door of the kitchen, which, we remember, was 
the hospital, nailed up. 

“No spattering on the wounded,” said he. 

He gave his last instructbns in the bascinent-room in a quick, but 
deep and calm voice ; Fcuilly listened, and answered in the nam'e of 
all. 

“First story, hold your axes ready to cut the staircase. Have vou 
them?” ^ 

“Yes,” said Fenilly. 

“How many ?” 

“Two axes and a pole-axe.” 

“Very well. There are twenty-six effective men left.” 

“How many muskets are there ?” 

“Thirty-four.” 

“Eight too inany. Keep these eight muskets loaded like the rest, 
and at hand. Swords and pistols in your belts. 'ITvcnty men to the 
barricade. Six in ambush at the dormer windows and at the window 
on the first story to fire ui)on the assailants through the loopholes 
in the paving-stones. Let tliere be no useless labourer here. Imme' 
diately, when the drum Ijeats the charge, let the twenty from below 
rush to the barricade. The first there will get the best places.” 

_ These dispositions made, he turned towards Javert, and said to 
him : 

“I won’t forget you,” 

And, laying a pistol on the table, he added : 

“The last man to leave this room will blow out the spy’s brains !” 

“Here ?” inquired a voice. 

"No, do not leave this corpse with ours. You can climb over the 
ittle barricade on the Rue Mondetour. ,lt is only four feet high. 
The man is well lied. You will take him there, and execute him 
there.” 

There was one man, at that moment, who was more impassable 
than Enjoiras ; it was Javert. 

Here Jean Valjean appeared. 

He. was in the throng of insurgents. He stejjped forward, and 
said to Enjoiras : 

“You are the commander ?” 

“Ye.s.” 

“You thanked me just now.” 

“In the name of the republic. The barricade has two saviours, 
Mariu.s Pontmercy and you.” 

“Do you think that I deserve a reward?” 



JEAN VALJEAN 


1033 


“Certainly.” 

“Well, I ask one.” 

“What?”. 

“To blow out that man’s brains myself.” 

Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an imperceptible 
movement, and said : 

“That is appropriate.” 

As for Enjolras, he had begun to reload his carbine; he cast his 
eyes about him : 

“No objection.” 

And turning towards Jean Valjean: “Take the spy.” 

Jean Valjean, in fact, took i^ossessioh of Javert by sitting down 
on the end of the table. He caught up the pistol, and a slight click 
announced that he had cocked it. 

Almost at the same moment, they heard a flourish of trumpets. 

“Come on !” cried Marius, from the top of the barricade. 

Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was pecu- 
liar to him, and, looking fixedly upon the insurgents, said to them ; 

“Your health is hardly better than mine.” 

“All outside?” cried Enjolras. 

The insurgents sprang forward in a tumult, and, as they went 
out, they received in the back, allow us the expression, this speech 
from Javert : 

. “Farewell till immediately!” 


XIX 

. JEAN VALJ]?AN TAKES TIIS REVENGE 

When Jean Valjean was alone with Javert, he untied the rope that 
held the pri.soncr by the middle of the body, the knot of which was 
under the table. Then he motioned to him to get up. 

Javert obeyed, with that undefinable smile into which the suplrem- 
acy of enchaii«:d authority is condensed. 

Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale as you would take a 
beast of burden by a strap, and, drawing him after him, went out 
of the wine-shop slowly, for Javert, with his legs fettered, could 
take only very short steps. 

Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand. . , 

They crossed thus the interior trapezium of the barricade. The 
insurgents, intent upon the imminent attack, were looking the other 

’WSLY# 

Marius, alone, placed towards the left extremity of the wall, saw 
them pass. This group of the victim and the eswutioner borrowed 
a light irom the sepulchral gleam which’ he had in his soul. 

jkn Valjean, with some difficulty, bound as Javert was, but

but he recalled tlie name. ’ 


1'his rennni.scence, however, was misty and indistinct like all his 
ideas. It was not an allirniation which he made to himself it was a 
question which he put : “ Is not this that inspector of police’who told 
me his ininie was Javert ?” 

Perhaps there was still time to interfere for this man ? But he must 
first know if it were indeed that Javert. 

.Marius called to hinjolras, who had just taken his place at the 
other end of the barricade. 

“Enjolras !’’ 

“What ?“ 

“What is titat man’s name 

“Who?” 

“The jKilice officer. Do you know hi.s name?” 

“Of cuur.se. He told us.” 

“What is his name ?” 

“Javert.” 

Marius sprang up. 

At that moment they heard the pistol-shot. 

Jean Valjean reapjK’arcd and cried ; “It is done.” 

A dreary chill passed through the heart of Marius. 


XX 

THE DEAD ARE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT WRONG 

The death-agony of the barricade was approaching;. 

• All things concurred in the tragic majesty of this supreme mo- 
ment ; R thousand mysterious disturbances in the air, the breath of 
armed masses set in motion in streets which they could not see, the 



1036 LES MISilRABLES 

intermittent gallop of cavalry, the heavy concussion of artillery on 
the march, the platoon firing and the cannonades crossing each other 
in the labyrinth of Paris, the smoke of the battle rising all golden 
above the roofs, mysterious cries, distant, vaguely terrible flashes 
of menace everywhere, the tocsin of Saint Merry which now had 
the sound of a sob, the softness of the season, the splendour of the 
sky full of sunshine and of clouds, the beauty of the day, and the 
appalling silence of the houses. 

For, since evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue de la Chan- 
vrerie had become two walls; savage walls. Doors closed, windows 
closed, shutters closed. 

In those days, so different from these in w’hich we live, when the 
hour had come in which the people wished to make an end of a state 
of affairs which had lasted too lnng,_ of a granted charter or of a 
constitutional country, when the universal anger was diffused in 
the atmosphere, when the city consented to the upheaval of its pave- 
ments, when insurrccticm made tlie I)ourgeoisie smile by whispering 
its watchword in its ear, then the inhabitant filled with cmeute, so 
to speak, was the auxiliary of the cnmljatant, and the house frater- 
nised with the impromptu fortress which leaned upon it. When the 
condition of affairs was not ripe, when the insurrection was not 
decidedly acceptable, when the mass disavowed the movement, it 
was all over with the combatants, the city changed into a desert 
about the revolt, souls were chilled, asylums were walled up, and 
the street became a defile to aid the army in taking the barricade. ' 

A people cannot be surprised into a rnore rapid progress t han it 
wills. Woe to him who attempts to force its hanil ! A people does not 
llowjtself to he used. Then it abandons the insurrection to itselfi 
?he insurgents become pestiferous. A house is an escarpment, a 
..oor is a refusal, a facade is a wall. Tins wall sees, hears,. and will 
not. It might open and save you. No. This wuill is a judge. It looks 
upon you and condemns you. How gloomy arc tlu'sc closed houses! 
They seem dead, they are living. I.ife, which is as it were suspended 
in them, still exists. Nobody has come out of them for twenty-four 
hours, but nobody is missing. In the interior of this rock, people go 
and come, they lie down, they get up ; they are at home there ; they 
drink and eat ; they are afraid there, a fe.’irftil thing! Fear excuses 
this terrible inhospitably ; it tempers it with timidity, a mitigating 
circumsitance. Sometimes even, and this has been seen, fear becomes 
passion ; fright may change into fury, as prudence into rage ; hence 
this saying so profound : The madmen of moderation. There are 
flamings of .supreme dismay from which rage springs like a dismal 
smoke. “What do these people want? They are never contented. 
They compromise peaceable men as if we had not had revolution 
enough like this ! What do they come here for ? Let them get out 
of it themselves. So much the worse for them. It is their own fault. 



JEAN VALJEAN 1037 

They have only got what they deserve. It doesn’t concern us. Here 
is our poor street riddled with balls. They are a parcel of scamps. 
Above all, don’t open the door.” And the house puts on the 
semblance of a tomb. The insurgent before that door is in his last 
agony ; he sees the grape and the drawn sabres coming ; if he calls, he 
knows that they hear him, but that they will not come ; there are 
walls which might protect him, there are men who might save him ; 
and those walls have ears of flesh, and those men have bowels of 
stone. 

Whom shall he accuse ? 

Nobody, and everybody. 

The imperfect age in which we live. 

It is alvrays at her own risk and peril that Utopia transforms her- 
self into insurrection, and from a philosophic protest becomes an 
armed protest, from Minerva, Pallas. The Utopia which grows im- 
patient and becomes emeute knows what awaits her ; almost always 
she is too soon. Then she resigns herself, and stoically accepts, in- 
stead of triumph, catastrophe. She serves, without complaining, 
and exonerating them even, those who deny her, and it is her mag- 
nanimity to consent to abandonment. She is indomitable against hin- 
drance, and gentle towards ingratitude. 

But is it ingratitude? 

Yes, from the point of view of the race. 

No, from the point of view of the individual. 

Progress is the mode of man. The general life of the human race 
is called Progress ; the collective advance of the human race is called 
Progress. Progres.s marches ; it makes the great human and terres- 
trial journey towards the celestial and the divine; it has its halts 
whore it rallies the belated flock ; it has its stations where it niedh 
tates, in sight of some splendid Canaan suddenly unveiling its hori- 
zon ; it has its nights when it sleeps ; and it is one of the bitter anxie- 
ties of the thinker to see the shadow upon the human soul, and to 
feel in the darkness progress asleep, without being able to waken jt. 

"Cod is dead perhaps," said Gerard de Nerval one day, to him 
who writes these lines, confounding progress with God, and mis- 
taking the interruption of the movement for the death of the Be- 
ing- 

He who desiairs is wrong. Progress infallibly awakens, and, in 
short, we might say that it advances even in sleep, for it has grown. 
When we see it standing again, we find it taller. To be always peace- 
ful belongs to progress no more than to the river ; raise no obstruc- 
tion, cast in no rock ; the obstacle makes water foam and humanity 
seethe. Hence troubles ; but after these troubles, we recognise that 
there has been some ground gained. Until order, which is nothing 
more nor less than universal pewe, be established, until haimony 
and unity rdign, progress will have revolutions for stations.

pected, their afterthought is dreaded, their conscience is denounced. 
They are_ reproached with raising, building, and heaping up against 
the reigning social state a mound of miseries, of sorrows, of iniqui- 
ties, of griefs, of despairs, and with tearing up blocks of darkness 
from the lower depths with which to entrench themselves and to 
fight. Men ciy to them : You are unpaving hell !” They might an- 
swcr; That is why our barricade is made of good intentions ” 

1 he best, certainly is the peaceable solution. On the whole let us 
admit, when we see the pavement, we think of the bear, and his is a 
willingness about which society is not at ease. But the salvation of 
society depends upon itself ; to its own willingness we appeal No 
violent remedy is necessary. Study evil lovingly, determine it then 
cure It. 1 0 that we urge. ’ 

However this may be, even when fallen, especially when fallen, 
they who, upon all points of the world, with eyes fixed 
on i; ranee, struggle for the great work with the inflexible logic of 
the ideal; they give their life a pure gift for progress ; they accom- 
phsh the will of I rovulence; they perform a religious act. At the 
appomteci hour, with as much dismterestedness as an actor who 
reaches his cue, olicdicnt to the divine scenario, thev enter into the 
tomb. And this hopeless conibat, and this stoical disappearance, they 
accept to lead to its splendid and supreme universal conseQiteiices 
the magiiihcent np of man, irresistibly commenced on the 
14th July, 1/h), these soldiers are priests. Xhe Prench Revolu** 
tion IS an act of (iod. 


^ Still, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to the dis- 
tincl ions ^ali eady indicated in another chapter, there are accepted 
in.sprrcctioti,s which arc called revolutions ; there are rejected revo- 
lutions wiiich are called cmeutes* An insurrection breaking out is 
an kiea passing its examination before the people. If the people 
dnips Its black ball, the idea is withered fruit ; the insurrection is aa 
' ahray. 

^ To go to war upon every summons and whenever Utopia desires 
It, is not the part of the iieoples. The nations Imve not always and at 
every hour the temperament of heroes and of martyns. 

They are positive. A jjriori, insurrection repels them ; first, be- 
cause it often results in disaster, secondly, because it always has an 
abstraction for its point of dejiarture. 

^ For, and this is beautiful, it is always for the Ideal, and for the 
Ideal alone, that tliose devote themselves who'do devote themselves, 
An insurrection js an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may work itself into 
anger ; hence tlie resort to arms. But every insurrection which is 
directed against a government or a r^ime aims still higher. Thus, 
1"^ iet us repeat what the chiefs of the insurrection of 
1832, and m particular the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chan- 
vrene, fought against, was not exaettv J-ouis Philippe. Most of

them, spealdni^ frankly, rendered justice to the qualities of this king 
mitlway between the mon:irchy and the revolution ; none hated him 
But they attacked the yonn,q'er branch of divine right in Louij 
Philipjje as tlu-y had attackeil the elder branch in Charles X.-and 
what they desired to overllimw in overthrowing royalty in France 
as we have explainech was tlit; usurpation of man over man, and of 
privilege over right, in the whole world. Paris without a king has 
as a consequence, the world witliout despots. They rca.soned in this 
way. Tludr aitn was distant duul&gt;tless, vague perliaps, and receding 
heOw. etTort, hut great. _ 

Thus it is. .'\nd men .sacriiice themselves for the.se vi.sions, which 
to llie .sacrificetl, are illnsions almost always, ]jut illusions with 
which, upon tiie whole, all hmnan eeriainty is mingled. The insur- 
gent ptietises and gikls the insurrection. Me throws himself into 
these tragic things, intoxicated with wh:it he is going to do. Who 
knows? tliey will succeed perlnqis. 'I’liev are but few; they have 
against them a whole army : Itiit they defend right, nalunal law, that 
sovereignty of each over himself, of which there is no abdication 
po-ssihle, jiistice, trntli, and in case of need they die like the three 
iitindred Sparltins, 'I'liey think not of ! )tin Quixote, hut of Leonidas. 
And they go forw;ird,au«I, once engaged, lliey do nut recoil, and they

tion completed, progress set at lilierty. the aggrandisement of the 
huiniui raee, universal tleliveratice ; and seeing at the worst a Tlier- 
niopylte. 

Tiie.se passages at arms for progress often fail; why, we have 
|u!it told. The throng is restive mail r the .sway of the paladins. The 
heavy masses, the limit it iides, fragile on account of their very 
weight, dread uiicertaiiuies; and there is niiccrtaiiity in the ideal. 

Moreover, let it not !«• forgotten, interests an? there, little friendly 
to the ide.'d and the emotiotial. .Sometimes the .stomach paralyses 
the heart. 

'riie gr.andeur and flu- heaiity of b'rance are that .she cares less 
for the helly than oilier people-.': she knots the rope .about her loins 
more easily. She is first awake, l.i.st asleei*. Slie goes in advance. She 
is a pioneer. 

That is because she is an artist. 

T'lie ideal i.s nothing more nor less than tlie culminating point of 
logic, even as the la'antifttl is iiutliing more nor !cs,s than the sum- 
mit of the true. T*he artist ijcojilc is thus the consistent people. To 
love beauty Is to see light, Tiiis is why the lorcli of ICurope, that is to 
say, civilisation, was lirst Immc by Vlrecce, wIuj passed it to Italy, 
who passed it to France, Divine pioneer iHiuples! Vtied kmpada

An admirable thing, the poetry? of a people is tlic element of its 
orc^resa. The amount of civilisation is measured by the amount of 



JEAN V A L J E A N 1041 

imagination. Only a civilising people must remain a manly people. 
Corinth, yes ; Sybaris, no. He who becomes effeminate becomes 
corrupt. We must be neither dilettanti nor virtuosi; but we must 
be artists. In the matter of civilisation, we must not refine, but we 
must sublime. On this condition, we give the human race the pattern 
of the ideal. 

The modern ideal has its type in art, and its means in science. It is 
through science that we shall realise that august vision of the poets : 
social beauty. We shall reproduce Eden by A+B. At the point 
which civilisation has i*eached, the exact is a necessary element of 
the splendid, and the artistic sentiment is not merely served, but 
completed by the scientific organ ; dream must calculate. Art, which 
is the conqueror, must have its fulcrum in science, which is the 
mover. The solidity of the mounting is important. The moderiT; 
spirit is tlie genius of Greece with the genius of India for its vehicle; 
Alexander upon the elephant. 

Races petrified in dogma or demoralised by lucre are unfit to lead 
civilisation. Genuflexion before the idol or the dollar atrophies the 
muscle which walks and the will which goes. Hieratic or mercantile 
absorption diminivshes the radiance of a people,, lowers its horizon 
by lowering its level, and deprives it of that intelligence of the uni- 
versal aim, at the same time human and divine, which makes the 
missionaiy nations. Babylon has no ideal. Carthage has no ideal. 
Athens and Rome have and preserve, even through all the thick night 
of centuries, haloes of civilisation. 

France is of the same quality of people as Greece and Italy. She is 
Athenian by the beautiful, and Roman by the great. In addition she 
is good. She gives herself. She is oftener than other peoples in the 
spirit of devotion and sacrifice. Only this spirit takes her and leaves 
her. And here lies tlie great peril for those who rim when she wishes 
to walk, or who walk when she wishes to stop. France has her re- 
lapses of materialism, and, at certain moments, the ideas which ob-. 
struct that sublime braiti lose all that recalls French greatness, and 
are of the dimensions of a Missouri or of a South Carolina. What is 
to be done ? The giantess is playing the dwarf ; immense France has 
her childish whims. That is all 

To this notiling can be said. A people, like a star, has the right of 
eclipse. And all is well, provided the light return and the eclipse do 
not degenerate into night. Dawn and resurrection are synonyms. 
Tlie reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the 
Me. 

Let us lay down these things with calmness. Death on the barri- 
cade*, or a grave in exile, is an acceptable alternative for devotion^ 
The true name of devotion is disinterestedness. Let the abandoned 
submit to abandonment, let the exile submit to exile, and let us con^ 
tent ourselves with imploring the great peoples not to recede too far.

The wall held well. 

The insurgents fired impetuously. The barricade scaled was like 
a mane of flashes. The assault was so sudden that for a moment it 
was overflowed by assailants ; but it shook off the soldiers as the lion 
does the dogs, and it was covered with besiegers only as a cliff is with 
foam, to reappear, a moment afterwards, steep, black, and .formid- 
able. 

The column, compelled to fall back, remained massed in the 
street, unsheltered, but terrible, and replied to the redoubt by a 
fearful fulisade. Whoever has seen fireworks remembers that sheaf 
made by a crossing of flashes which is called the bouquet. Imagine 
the bouquet, not now vertical, but horizontal, bearing a ball, a buck- 
shot, or a bullet, at the point of each of its jets of fire, and scattering 
death in its clusters of thunder. The barricade was beneath it. 

On both sides equal resolution. Bravery there was almost bar- 
baric, and was mingled with a sort of heroic ferocity which began 
with the sacrifice of itself. Those were the days when a National 
Guard fought like a Zouave. The troops desired to make an end of it ; 
the insurrection desired to struggle. The acceptance of death in full 
youth and in full health makes a frenzy of intrepidity.' Every man 
in this melee felt the aggrandisement given by the supreme hour. 
The street was covered with dead. 

Enjolras was at one end of the barricade, and Marius at the other* 
Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reserved and 
sheltered himself ; three soldiers fell one after the other, under his 
battlement, without even having perceived him; Marius fought 
without shelter. He took no aim. He stood with more than half his 
body above the summit of the redoubt. There is no wilder prodigal 
than a miser who takes the bit in his. teeth; there is no man more 
fearful in action than a dreamer. Marius was terrible and pensive, ' 
He was in the battle as in a dream. One would have said a phantom 
firing a musket. 

The cartridges of the besieged were becoming exhausted ; not so 
their sarcasms. In this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they 
wei-e, they laughed, 

Courfeyrac was bareheaded. 

‘What have you done with your hat?'’ inquired Bossuet. 

Courfeyrac answered 

“They have knocked it off at last by their cannonade." 

Or indeed they said haughty things. 

“Does anybody understand these men," exclaimed Feuilly bitterly 
(and he cited the names, well-known names, famous even, some of 
the old army), “who promised to join us, and took an oath to help 
us, and who were bound to it in honour, and who are our generals, 
and who abandon us !" 

And Combeferre simply answered with a grave smile:

dows of the wine-shop, from the gratings of tlic cellars into which 
some had slipped. 'I hey were one against sixty. The facade of Co-

lerre, pierced by three bayonet-thrusts in the breast, just as he was 
lifting a wounded soldier, had only time to look to heaven, and ex- 
pired. 

Marius, still fighting, was so hacked with wounds, particularly 
about his head, that the countenance was lost in blood, and you 
would have said that he had his face covered with a red handker- 
chief. 

Enjolras alone was untouched. When his weapon failed, he 
reached his hand to right or left, and an insurgent put whatever 
weapon he could in his grasp. Of four swords, one more than Fx'an- 
cis L at Marignan, he now had but one stump remaining. 

Homer says : *‘Diomed slays Axylus, son of Teuthras, who dwel \ 
in happy Arisbe ; Euryalus, son of Mecisteus, exterminates Dreso \ 
and Opheltios, Aesepus, and that Pedasus whom the Naiail 
Abarbarea conceived by the irreproachable Bucolion ; Ulysse j 
overthrows Pidutes of Percote; Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypsetea, 
Astyalus ; Polydamas, Otus of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon, Mq • 
ganthis dies beneath the spear of Euripylus. Agamemnon, King ol 
heroes, prostrates Elatiis born in the lofty city which the sounding 
Satnio laves.^' In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian attacks the 
giant Marquis Swantibore with a two-edged flame, while he defends 
himself by stoning the knight with the towers which he tears up. 
Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two dukes of Brittany and 
of Bourbon, armed, mailed, and crested for war, on horseback, and 
meeting each other, battle-axe in hand, masked with iron, booted 
with iron, gloved with iron, one caparisoned with ermine, the other 
draped with azure ; Brittany with his lion between the two horns of 
his crown, Bourbon with a monstrous fleur de lys on the vizor of 
his casque. But to be siipei-b, it is not necessary to bear, like Yvon, 
the ducal morion, to handle, like Esplandian, a living flame, or like 
Phyles, father of Polydamas, to have brought from Ephyrae a fine 
armour, a present from the king of men Euphetes ; it is enough to 
give life for a conviction or for a lojralty* That little artless soldier, 
yesterday a peasant of Beauce or Limousin, who prowls, cabbage- 
knife at his side* about the children's nurses in the Luxembourg, 
that pale young student bending over a piece of anatomy or a book, 
a fair-haired youth who trims his beard with scissors, take them 
both, breathe upon them a breath of duty, place them opposite each 
other in the Boucherat square or in the Cul-de-sac Blanche Mibray, 
and let the one fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and Itt 
them both imagine that they are fighting for the country ; the strife 
will be colossal ; and the shadow which will be thrown upon that 
great epic field where humanity is struggling, by his blue-coat and 
this saw-bones in quarrel, will equal the shadow which is cast by 
Megaryon, King of Lycia, full of tigers, wrestling body to body 
with the immense Ajax, equal of the gods.

verte bear down the bayonets about him and before him, and en- 
tei'CCi lasL of all ; and for an instant it was horrible,, the soldiers 
struggling to get in, the insurgents to close the door. The door was 
close' 1_ with such violence that, in shutting into its frame, it exposed, 
cut 'olf, and adhering to the casement, the thumb and fingers of a 
soldier who had caught hold of it. 

Marius remained without. A ball had broken his shoulder-blade ; 
he felt that he was fainting, and that he was falling. At that moment, 
his eyes already closed, he experienced the shock of a vigorous hand 
seizing him, and his fainting fit, in which he lost consciousness,, left 
him hardly time for this thought, mingled with the last memory of 
Cosette; ‘T am taken prisoiicT. I shall be shot.” 

lJujolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge 
in the wine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached that mo- 
ment when each has only time to tliink of his own death. Enjolras 
fixer! the bar of the door and bolted it, and fastened it with a double 
turn of lock and padlock, while they were heating furiously on the 
outside, the soldiers with the butts of their muskets, jjhe sappers 
with their axes. The assailants were massed upon this^oor. The 
siege of the wine-shop was now beginning. 

'Phe soldiers, we must say, were greatly irritated. 

The death of the sergeant of artilleiy had angered them ; and 
then, a more deadly thing, during the tew hours which preceded 
the attack, it had been told among them that the insurgents muti- 
laterl prisoners, and that there was in the wine-shop the body of a 
soldier headless. This sort of unfortunate rumour is the ordinary 
accompaniment of civil wars, and it was a false report of this kind 
which, at a later day, caused the catastrophe of the Rue Trans- 
nonain. 

When the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the rest: 

“Let us sell ourselves dearly.” 

1'hen he aiiproached the lahfe upon which Mabeuf and Gavroche 
were extemied. Two .straiglit and rigid forms could he seen under 
the black cloth, one large, the other small, and the two faces were 
vaguely outlined beneath the stiff folds of the shroud, A hand pro- 
jecied 'from lielow the pall, and hung towards the floor. It was the 
old man’s. 

Knjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand, as in the 
evening he had kissed the forehead. 

They were the only kisses which he had given in his life. 

We must l)e brief. The barricade had struggled like a gate of 
Thebe.s ; the wine-shop .struggled like a house of Saragossa. Such 
resistances are dogged. No quarter. No parley possible. They are 
willing to die provided they kill. When Sudiet says : “Capitulate,” 
Palafox answers : “After the war with- cannon, war with the knife.”

heads of those who were entering^. He had put the billiard table 
between the assailants and himself ; he had retreated to the corner 
of the room, and there, with proud eye, haughty head, and that 
stump of a weapon in his grasp, he was still so formidable that a 
large space was left about him. A cry arose : 

“This is the chief. It is he who killed the artilleryman. As he has 
put himself there, it is a good place. Let him stay. Let us shoot him 
on the si:)ot,''' 

“Shoot me/'’ said Enjolras. 

And, throwing away the stump of his carbine, and folding his 
arms, he presented his breast. 

The l.)oldness that dies well always moves men. As soon as En- 
jolras had foldcid his arms, accepting the end, the uproar of the con- 
flict ceased in the room, and that chaos suddenly hushed into a sort 
of sepulchral solemnity. It seemed as if the menacing majesty of 
Enjolras, disarmed and motionless, weighed upon that tumult, and 
as if, merely by the authority of his tranquil eye, this young man, 
who alone had no wound, superb, bloody, fascinating, indifferent 
as if he were invulnerable, compelled that sinister mob to kill him 
res])cct fully. His beauty, at that moment, augmented by his dig- 
nity, was a resplendence, and, as if he could no more be fatigued 
than wounded, after tlie terrible twenty-four hours which had jUsSt 
elai)se(l, he was fresh and rosy. It was of him perhaps that the wit- 
ness s])oke who said afterwards before the court-martial: “There 
was one insurgent whom I heard called Apollo.” A National Guard 
who was aiming at Enjolras, dropped his weapoti, saying: “It seems 
to me that I am shooting a flower.” 

Twelve men formed in platoon in the corner opposite Enjolras 
and made their muskets ready in silence. 

Tlien a scTgeant cried : “Take aim !” 

An officer intervened. 

“Wait.” 

And addressing ICnjolras : 

“Do you wish your eyes l)andaged?” 

“No.” 

“Was It really you who killed the sergeant of artillery?” 

“Yes.” 

Within a few seconds Grantaire had awakened. 

Grantaire, it will he remembered, had been asle€i&gt; since the day, 
previous in the iq^per room of the wine-shop, sitting in a chair, 
leaning lujavily forward on a table. 

He realised, in all its energy, strength, the old metaphor: dead 
drunk. Hie hideous potion, absinthe-stout-alcohol, had throv/ri 
him into a lethargy. His table being small, and of no use in the bar^ 
ricade, they had left it to him. He had continued in the same pos*‘ 
ture, liis ba*ast doubled over the table, his head lying flat, upon hi^

crushing sleep of the torpid bear and the overfed leech, Nulhiug b.-id 
afTected him, neither the musketry, nor theli:d]s, lair the graju- wliiTi 
penetrated through the caseinenl into tlie room in which he wa.s. 
Nor the prodigious uproar of the assault. Only, he responded some- 
times to the cannon with a snore, lie seemeil wtiiting there for a 
ball to come and save him the trouble td tuviikiiig. Several corpses 
lay about him; and, at the first glance, nothing distinguishe:! him 
from those deep sleepers of de.ath. 

Noise docs not waken a dnuikard : .silence wakens him. 'Phis 
pcculiurily has been observetl mon tlrati onee, 'I’he fall of evtu’y- 
thing about him augmented (Irantaire's obIi\'inii: destj'uctiun was 
a lullaby to him. The kind of hall in the tumult before Ihijolrtis was 
a shock to his heavy sleep, it was the effect of ;• waiysm at ;i gallop 
.stopping short. 'I’lie .sleepers are rouM'd by it. &lt; ir.autaire rose u]i 
with a start, stretched his arms, rubbed his eyes, looketl, gaped, an 1

Drunkenness ending is like a curtain torn away. \\‘e see alto-

nothing of what has taken place for twenlv-four hours, h.as tm 
sooner opened his eyes than he is aw, are of all th.at has jtassed. His 
ideas come Iwick to him with an abrupt lucidity ; the elVaftaneut of 
drunkeimess, a sort of lye-wash which blinds the brain, dissipates, 
and give place to clear and precise impressions of tlie reality. 

Rctireii as he was in a comer a»id as it wtre sheltered liehind the 
hilUard-taiilc, the soldiers, flteir eyes fixetl ujK&gt;n iMijoIrtts. had not 
even noticed Grantiiire, and the sergeant was (weparing to r&lt;‘pejit 
the or&lt;ler ; “T,nke aim !“’ whtsn suddenly they heart! a powerful voice 
cry (Hit beside them ; 

la Ri'puhlitiih'! 1 belong to it." 

Gnmltiirc had tirisen. 

The immense glare of the whoU? combat which he had ntissed 
and in whielt he had not been, iippttared in tlte flaslttng ey«! of the 
transfigured drunkard. 

He repeated: “DiT'c la crossed the room with a 

firm step, and took his plaee before the nmskefs beside Ktijolras. 

“Two at oiitt shot,” said he. 

And, turning towards Enjolras genlh', be said to him : 

“Will you permit it ?” 

Enjo!ra.s gras|)ed his Itand with n smile. 

'I’he smile was not finished when the rejK»rt was he,ird, 

Enjolras, pierced Ity eight Imlls, remained backed against the 
wall as if the bails had nailed him there. Only he lK»we&lt;i Ins head. 

Grantaire, stricken down, fell at his feet. 

A few moments afterwards, the soldiers dislodged the last in- 



JEAN VALJEAN 1051 

surgents who had taken refuge in the top of the house. They fired 
through a wooden lattice into the garret. They fouglit in the attics^ 
They threw the bodies out of the windows, some living. Two vol- 
tigeurs, who were trying to raise the shattered omnibus, were killed 
by two shots from a carbine fired from the dormer-windows. A 
man in a blouse was pitched out headlong, with a bayonet thrust 
in his belly, and his death-rattle was finished upon the ground. A 
soldier and an insurgent slipped together on the slope of the tiled 
roof, and would not let go of each other, and fell, clasped in a wild 
embrace. Similar struggle in the cellar. Cries, shots, savage stamp- 
ing. Then silence. The barricade was taken. 

The soldiers commenced the search of the houses round about 
and the pursuit of the fugitives. 


XXIV 

PRISONER 

Marius was in fact a prisoner. Prisoner of Jean Valjean. 

Tlie hand wliich had seized him from behind at the moment he 
was falling, and the grasp of which he had felt in losing conscious- 
ness, was the hand of Jean Valjean. 

Jean Valjean had talcen no other part in the combat than to ex- 
pose himself. Save for him, in that supreme phase of the death- 
struggle, noliody would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to 
him, evex7wliere present in the carnage like a providence, those ■vriio 
fell were taken up, carried into the basement-room, and their wounds 
dressed. In tlie intervals, he repaired the barricade. But nothing 
which could resemble a blow, an attack, or even a personal defence 
came from his hands. He was silent, and gave aid. Moreover, he had 
only a few scratches. The balls refused him. If suicide were a par*! 
of what had occurred to him in coming to this sepulchre, in fhaft 
respect he had not succeeded. But we doubt whether he had thought 
of suicide, an irreligious act. 

Jean Valj(*an, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to 
see Marius ; the fact is, that he did not take his eyes from him. When 
a shot struck down Marius, Jean Valjean bounded with the agility 
of a tiger, dropped upon him as upon a prey, and carried him away* 

The whirlwind of the attack at that instant concentrated so 
fiercely upon Knjulras and the door of the wine-shop, that nobody 
saw Jean Valjean cross the unpaved field of the barricade, holding 
the senseless Marius in his arms, and disappear behind the corner 
of the house of Corinth. 

It will be rememl&gt;ered that this corner was a sort of cape on the 
street ; it sheltered from balls and grape, and from sight also, a few 
square feet of ground. Thus, there is sometimes in conflagrations 



1052 LKS MISERABLES 

a room which does n&lt;jt burn ; and in the most furious seas, beyond 
a promontory or at the end of a cul-de-sac of sImxiIs, a placid little 
haven. It was in this recess of the interior trapezium of the barri- 
cade that Eponine had died. 

There Jean Valjean stopped ; lie k't Marius slide to the ground, 
set his back to the wall, atid cast his eyes about him. 

The situation was appalling. 

For the moment, for two or three minutes, perhaps, this .skirt of 
wall was a slielter; htit liow escape from this massacre? He re- 
membered the anguish in which lie was iii the Rue Folonceau, eight 
years before, and how he. had succeeded in e.scaping; that was dif- 
ficult then, tu-&lt;lay it was impossible. Before, him he had that deaf 
ami implacable liouse of six .stories, which sceined innahited only 
by the dead man, leaning over his window ; on his right ho had the 
low barricade, winch closed the I'elite 'rniaiulerie ; to clamber over 
tins obstacle appeared easy, Inil aliove the crest of tlie wall a range 
of bayonet -points coidd he seen. .'V company of the line was posted 
beyond tiiis liarricade, on the watch. It was evident that to cross 
the barricade was to meet the lire of a platoon, and that every head 
which .should venture to rise above the top of the wall of paving- 
stones would .serve as a target for sixty muskets. At his left he had 
the field of combat. Death was liehind the corner of the wall. 

What .should lie do ? 

A bird alone could have extricateil himself from that place. 

And he must decide upon the .sjiot, liiul an cxperlient, adopt hivS 
course. They were fighting a few steps from him ; by good luck all 
■were fiercely intent upon a single j»oint,_ihe door of the wine-shop; 
but let one .soldier, a single one, conceive the idea of turning the 
house of attacking it in Hank, am! all was over. 

Jean Valjean looked at the house in front of him, he looked at 
the barricade by the side of him, then he looked upon the ground, 
with the violence of the hast extreinjly, in desperation, and as if he 
would have made a hole in it with his eyes. 

Beneath his persistent look, something vaguely tangilile in such 
an agony outlined itself and took form at his feet, as if there were 
a power in the eye to tlevelop the thing desired. He jxirceived a few 
steps from him, at the foot of the little wall so pitilessly watched and 
guarded on the outside, under some fallen paving-stones which 
partly hid it, an iron grating laid flat and level with the ground. 
This grating, made of strong transverse bars, was about two feet 
square. The stone frame which held it had been torn up, and it was 
as it were unset. Through the bars a glimp.se could be caught of an 
obscure opening, something like the flue of a chimney or the main of 
a cistern. Jean Valjean sprang forward. His old science of escape 
mounted to his brain like a flash. To remove the stones, to Hft me 
grating, to load Marius, who was as inert as a dead body, upon his 



JEAN VALJEAN 1053 

shoulders, to descend, with that burden upon his back, by the aid 
of his elbows and knees, into this kind of well, fortunately not very 
deep, to let fall over his head the heavy iron trapdoor upon which 
the stones were shaken back again, to find a foothold upon a flagged 
surface ten feet below the ground, this was executed like what is 
done in delirium, with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an 
eagle ; it required but very few moments. 

Jean Valjean found himself, with Marius still senseless, in a sort 
of long underground passage. 

There, deep peace, absolute silence, night. 

The impression wliich he had formerly felt in falling from the 
street into the convent came back to him. Only, what he was now 
carrying away was not Cosette ; it was Marius. 

He could n(,)w hardly hear above him, like a vague murmur, the 
feariul tumult of tlie wine-shop taken by assault. 



BOOK SECOND 

THE INTESTINE OF LEVIATHAN 
I 

, THE EARTH IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA 

Paris throws five millions a year into the sea. And this wilhmtt 
metaphor. How, and in whut manner? day and ni^ht. With what 
object ? without any object. With what thoufjht ? withonl thinking 
of it. For what retum? for nothing. By inerins of what organ? by 
means of its intestine. What is its inte.stine ? its sewer. 

Five millions is the most moderate of the apjtro.siinale figure.s 
which the estimates of special science give. 

Science, after long experiment, ne w knows tliat the most fertilis- 
ing and the most clTective of manures is that of man. 'I'he Chinese, 
we must say to our shame, knew it before us. No Cliinesc peasant, 
Eckeberg tells us, goes to the city without carrying hack, at the 
two ends of his bamboo, two buckets ftdl of what we call filth. 
Thpks to human fertilisation, the earth in China is still ;is young 
as in the days of Abraham. Chinese wheat yields a lumilnsl and 
twenty foId.There is no guano comparable in fertility to the &lt;!e- 
tritus of capital. _A great city is the most powerful of stereoraries. 
To employ the city to enrich the plain would be a .sure .siiccc.sh. If 
our gold is filth, on the other hand, our filth is gold. 

What is done with this filth, gold? It is swejrt into the ahy.ss. 

We fit out convoys of ships, at great cxiiense, to gatlicr up at the 
south pole the droppings of petrels and iwnguins, and the incalcul- 
able element of wealth which we have under our own hand, we .send 
to the sea. All the human and animal manure which the world loses, 
restored to the land instead of being thrown into the water, would 
suffice to nourish the world. 

These heaps of garbage at the comers of the stone blocks, these 
tumbrils of mire jolting through the streets at night, these horrid 
scavengers’ carts, these fetid streams of subterranean slime which 
the pavement hides from you, do you know what ali this is ? It Is the 
flowering meadow, it is the green grass, it is marjoram and thyme 
and sage, it is game, it is cattle, it is the satisfied low of huge oxen 
at evening, it is perfumed hay, it is golden com, it is bread on your 
table, it is wrrm blood in your veins, it is h«dth, it is joy, it Is life. 

1054 



JEAN VALJEAN 1055 

Thus wills that mysterious creation which is transformation upon 
earth and transfiguration in heaven. 

Put that into the great crucible; your abundance shall spring 
from it. The nutrition of the plains makes the nourishment of men. 

You have the power to throw away this wealth, and to think me 
ridiculous into the bargain. That will cap the climax of your igno- 
rance. 

Statistics show that France, alone, makes a liquidation of a hun- 
dred millions every year into the Atlantic from the mouths of her 
rivers. Mark this : with that hundred millions you might pay a 
quarter of the expenses of the government. The cleverness of man 
is sucli that he prefers to throw this hundred millions into the gut- , 
ter. It is the very substance of the people which is carried away, 
here drop by drop, there in floods, by the wretched vomiting of our 
sewers into the rivers, and the gigantic collection of our rivers into 
the ocean, Eacli hiccough of our cloaca costs us a thousand francs. 
Ih'oin tins two results: the land impoverished and the water in- 
fected. Hunger rising from the furrow and disease rising from the 
river. 

It is iiDtorious, for instance, that at this hour the Thames is 
poisoning London, 

As for Paris, it has been necessary within a few years past, to 
carry most of the mouths of the sewers down the stream below the 
last bridge. 

A double tubular arrangement, provided with valves and sluice- 
ways, sucking up and flowing back, a system of elementary draim 
age, as simple as the lungs of man, and which is ah-eady in full op- 
eratioti in several villages in England, would suffice to bring into our 
cities the x&gt;ure water of the fields and send back into our fields the 
rich water of the cities; and this easy .see-saw, the simplest in the 
world, would retain in our possession the hundred millions thrown 
away. We are thinking of something else. 

The present system does harm in endeavouring to do good. The 
intention is good, the result is sad. Men think they are purging the 
city, tliey are emaciating the papulation. A sewer is a mistake. When 
drainage everywhere, with its double function, restoring what it 
takes away, shall have replaced the sewer, that simple impoverishing 
washing, then, this being combined with the data of a new social 
economy, the products of the earth will be increased tenfold, and the 
problem of misery will be wonderfully diminished. Add the sup- 
pression of parasitism, it will be solved. ^ 

In the meantime, the public wealth runs off into the river, and 
the leakage continues. Leakage is the word. Europe is ruining her- 
self in this way by exhaustion. ^ 

As far l^rance, we have just tiamed her figure. Now, Pans con- 
taining a twenty-fifth of the tatil French population, and dit

Mnrenver, ]|i:iriicn!ai!y in this imnieinnri.il ami senseless waste, 
Paris herself iniii.ates. 

These surprising alisnrilities .are nnl new; there is nn ynting fnlly 
in this. The ancients acted like the miHlerns. " The elnacte nf kninc,’’ 
says Liebig, “absorbetl all the wril-heing nf the Unman peasant. 
When the Camnagim of Rome was ruined liy lire linmatt sewer, 
Rome exlwusted Italy, and wlwn she iwil inn Italy into her ckmen,

engnlfcd the world. This ci»:ir,a ufTcred its maw to the city and to 
theglohc. Url’i ef nrbi Kirriial city, unfathomable sewer. 

In the.se things, as well as in others, Rome sets the example. 

This example, Ihiris follows, with all the stupidity |iccuUar to 
cities of genius. 

For the necessities of the oiwration which we liave j ust explained, 
Paris has another Paris under herself ; a I’aris of 8cwcr.s ; which has 


its streets, its crossings, its wiuares, its blind altcys, its arteries, and 
its circulation, whichls slime, minus the human form.

JEAN VALJEAN 1059 

When a man has passed his time on the earth in enduring the spec- 
tacle of the grand airs which are assumed by reasons of state, oaths, 
political wisdom, human justice, professional honesty, the neces- 
sities of position, incorruptible robes, it is a consolation to enter a 
sewer and see the slime which befits it. 

It is a lesson at the same time. As we have just said, history passes 
through the sewer. The Saint Bartholomews filter drop by drop 
through the pavements. The great public assassinations, the political 
and religious butcheries, traverse this vault of civilisation, and push 
their dead into it. To the reflecting eye, all the historic murderers 
are there, in the hideous gloom, on their knees, with a little of their 
shroud for an apron, dolefully sponging their work. Louis XL is 
there with Tristan, Francis 1. is there with Dupi^at, Charles IX. is 
there with his mother, Richelieu is there with Louis XIIL, Louvois 
is there, Letellicr is there, Hebert and Maillard are there, scraping 
the stones, and endeavouring to efface all trace of their deeds. Be- 
neath these vaults we hear the broom of these ^spectres. We breathe 
the enormous fetidness of social catastrophes. We see reddish re- 
flections in the corners. There flows a terrible water, in which 
bloody hands have been washed. 

The social observer should enter these shades. They are part of 
his laboratory* Philosophy is the microscope of thought. Everything 
desires to flee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation is use- 
less. What phase of your character do you show in tergiversation? 
the shameful phase. Philosophy pursues evil with its rigid search, 
and does not permit it to glide away into nothingness. In the ef- 
facement of things which disappear, in the lessening of those which 
vanish, it recognises everything. It rccon.structs the purple from the 
rag and the woman from the tatter. Witli the cloaca it reproduces the 
city; with the mire it reproduces its customs. From a fragment it 
infers tlie amphora, or the pitcher. It recognizes by the print of a 
finger nail upon a parchment the difference between the Jewry of 
die judengasse and the Jewry of the Ghetto. It finds in what re- 
mains what has been, the good, the ill, the false, the true, the stain 
of blood in the palace, the blot of ink in the cavern, the drop of grease 
in the brothel, trials undergone, temptations welcomed, orgies 
spewed out, the wrinkles which characters have received in abasing 
themselves, the trace of prostitution in souls which their own gross- 
ness has made capable of it, and, on the vest of the port^s of Rome, 
the mark of Messalina's elbow, 

in 

BRUNESEAU 

The sewer of Paris, in the Middle Ages, was legendary. In the six- 
teenth century, Henry IL attempted an. examination, which failed.

Sometimes, tlie sewer of Paris lonk it into its he 1 1 to overtluw, 
as if tlial unajijireeiatetl Kile were smidenly sei/r tl with wtath. 
There were, in famous to relate, iimnilaiii 'tis front the sewer, ,\l in- 
tervals, this slomaeh of civilisation die.esied Inelly, tb.e eloai a flowed 
back into the eiiy's throat, and Paris had the atieila- le of it-, slime. 
These reseinlilanees of the sewer to remorse h;td some good in 
them; they were warnings; very badly received, how-ver; the city 
was indignant that its mire should have so nntdi attdaciiy, and tlill 
nut coiiutenance the return of the ordtiie. iJrive it away I letter,

sewer of the Ciieinin V'ert, the Kuc de la Korjiicite hv tfie sewer

century, the poet more than the king. It atiainctl its maxinuirn depth 
in the Rue Saint Pierre, where it rose three fret aU«vc the llagging 
of the water-spouts, and its maximum extent in the Hue Saint Sabin, 
where it spread out over a length of two hundred and sixtyoiie 
yards. ' 

At the commencement of this century, the sewer of Paris was still 
a mysterious place. Mire can never be in good repute ; but here ill- 
fame reached even fright.Paris dimly realised that she had a terrilile 
cave beneath her. People talked of it as of that monstrous bog of 
Thebes which swarmed with scoiopendras fifteen feet bng, amd

which might have served as a bathing-tub for Behemoth. The big 
boots of the sewer-men never ventured beyond certain known 
points. They were still very near the time when the scavengers’ 
tumbrils, from tlie top of which Sainte Foix fraternised with the 
Marquis of Crcqui, were simply emptied into the sewer. As for 
cleansing, that operation was confided to the showers, which ob- 
structed more than they swept out. Rome still left some poetry to her 
cloaca, and called it Gemoniae; Paris instilted hei's and called it 
the Stink-Hole. Science and superstitions were at one in regard to 
the horror. The Stink-Hole was not less revolting to hygiene than 
to legend. The Goblin Monk had appeared under the fetid arch of 
the Mouffctard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets had been 
thrown into the sewer of the Barillerie ; Fagon had attributed the 
fearful malignant fever of 1685 to the great gap in the sewer of the 
Marai.s which remained yawning until 1833, in the Rue Saint Louis, 
almo.st in front of the sign of the Gallant Messenger. The mouth 
of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was famous for the pesti- 
lence which came from it ; with its pointed iron grating which looked 
like a row of teeth, it lay in that fatal street like the jaws of a dragon 
blowing hell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the 
gloomy Parisian sink with an indefinably hideous mixture of the in- 
finite. The sewer was bottomless. The sewer was the barathrum. 
The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not occur even to 
the police. To tempt that unknown, to throw the lead into that dark- 
ness, to go on a voyage of discovery in that abyss, who would have 
dare&lt;l ? It was frightful. Somebody, came forward, however. The 
cloaca had its Columbus. 

One d&lt;'iy in 1805, on one of those rare visits which the emperor 
made to Paris, the Minister of the Interior came to the toaster’s 
private audience. In the carrousel was heard the clatter of the 
swords of all those marvellous soldiers of the Grand Republic and 
the Grand Empire ; there was a multitude of heroes at the door of 
Napoleon ; men of the Rhine, of the Scheldt, of the Adige, and of 
the Nile ; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau, of Hoche, 
of Klebcr ; balloonists of IHenrus ; grenadiers of Mayence, pontoon- 
iers of Genoa, liusisars whom the Pyramids had beheld, artillery- 
men whom Junot’s ball had bespattered, cuirassiers who had taken 
by a.ssault the fleet at anchor in the Zuyder Zee ; these had followed 
Bonaparte over the bridge of Lodi, those had been with Murat in 
the trenches of Mantua, others had preceded Lannes in the sunken 
road of Montebello. The whole army of that time was there, in the 
Court of the Tuileries, represented by a squad or a platoon, guard- 
ing Napoleon in repose ; and it was the splendid epoch wh6n the 
grand army had behind it Marengo and before it Austerlitz. “Sire." 
.said the Minister of the Interior to Napoleon, “I saw yesterday the 
boldest man in your empire.” “Who is the man,” said the emj^ror

the ideal of; what is nnclerstoocl in England by the word "'respect- 
able/’ It is comely and sober; drawn by the line; we might almost 
say fresh from tlie ])an(l-l)ox. It is like a contractor become a coun- 
cillor ol state. W'e, almost sec clearly in it. The filth comports itself 
decently. At the first glance, we should readily take it for one of 
tliose underground ])assages formerly so common and so useful 
for the llighl of lunnarchs and princes, in that good old time “when 
the ])eo{)lo loved tlieir kings.’’ The present sewer is a beautiful 
sewer ; the ])ure style reigns in it ; the classic rectilinear alexandrine 
wliich, driven from poetry, a])pears to have taken refuge in ar- 
clnlectnrc‘, st*fms mingled with every stone of that long darkling 
and whitish arcli ; each discharging mouth is an arcade ; the Rue de 
Kivoli rules the school even in the cloaca. However, if the geometric 
line is in pl;u'(* anywliere, it surely is in the stercorary trenches of a 
great city. 11iere, all should he suhordiiiated to the" shortest road. 
Tile sew(‘r lias now assumed a certain ofiicial aspect. The very 
police rep«»rts of which it is sometimes the olficct are no longer 
wanting in respect for it. 1'lie words wdiich characterise it in the 
administrative languagt! arc elevated and dignified. What was called 
a gut is calletl a, gallery ; what was called a hole, is called a vista. Vil- 
lon wotild no longer recognise his old dwelling in case of need. Thi$ 
network of caves has still indeed its immemorial population of 
rod(*n(s, swarming more than ever; from time to time, a rat, an old 
moustaclte. ri.sks liis head at the window of the sewer and examines 
the Parisians; hut thc*se vermin tlumisclves have grown tame, con- 
tent as they ,'ire with tlieir stihterranean palace. The cloaca has now 
nothing of its primitive ferocity. The rain, wdiich befouled the siewer 
of fornuu" times, waslu‘s the sewer of the present day. Do not trust 
in it too nuadu hi&gt;wever. Miasmas still inhabit it. It is rather hypo- 
critical Ilian irrcproachahle. 'Hie pnd’ectnre of police and the health 
commissinn havi* laboured in vain. In spite of all the processes of 
puriiicatiiin, it exhales a vague odour, suspicious as Tartuffe, after 
conh*ssii »ii. 

Pel ns admit, as, all tilings considered, street-cleaning is a homage 
which llu* stiver [»ays to civilisation, and as, from this point of view, 
'l artuiTe’s ct»ust,denVe is an advance upon Aitgeas’ stable, it is cer- 
tain that the sewer of Paris ha.s been ameliorated. 

It is inort! tiian an advance ; it is a transmutation. Between the an- 
cient sewer and the present sewer, there is a revolution. Who has 
wrottghl this revolution? 

11ie man whom &lt;‘verybody forgets, and whom we have named,

tinder the Saint Martin canal, a fissure opened in the bed of the 
:anal; the water suddenly rose in the works underground, beyond 
all the power of the pumps ; they were obliged to seek the fissure, 
which was in the neck of the great basin, by means of a diver, and 
it was not without difficulty that it was stopped. Elsewhere, near the 
Seine, and even at some distance from the river, as, for instance, at 
Belleville, Grande Rue, and the Luniere arcade, we find quicksand? 
ill which we sink, and a man may be buried out of sight. Add as- 
phyxia from the miasma, burial by the earth falling in, sudden set- 
tlings of the bottom. Add typhus, with which the labourers are 
slowly impregnated. In. our day, after having excavated the gallery 
□f Clichy, with a causeway to receive a principal, water-pipe from 
the Ourcq, a, work executed in a trench, over ten yards in depth: 
after having;, in spite of slides, by means of excavations, often pu- 
trid, and by props, arched:the,Bievre f rom the Boulevard de THopital 
to the Seine ; after having, to deliver Paris from the swelling water5» 
of Montmartre and to furnish, an outlet, for that fluvial sea of twenty- 
two acres which stagnated near the Barriere des Martyrs, after hav- 
ing, we say, constructed the line of sewers from the Barriere Blanchf 
to the Aubervilliers road, in four months, working day and night. 


at a depth o£ twelve yards ; after having, a thing which had not been 
seen before, executed entirely underground a sewer in the Rue 
Earre du Bee, without. a trench, twenty feet below the surface. 
Superintendent Monnot died. After having arched three thousand 
yards of sewers in all parts of the city, from the Rue Traversiere 
Saint Antoine to the Rue de TOurcine ; after having, by the branch- 
ing of the Arbalete, relieved the Censier Mouffetard Square from 
inundation by the rain ; after having built the Saint Georges sewer 
upon stone- work and concrete in the quicksand; after having di- 
xected the dangerous lowering of the floor of the Notre Dame de 
Nazareth branch, Engineer Duleau died. There are* no bulletins iot 
these acts of bravery, more profitable, however, than the stupid 
daughter of the battle-field. &lt; • i 

The sewers of Paris, in 1832,. were far from, being what they 
are to-day. Bruneseau had made a beginning, but it required the 
cholera to determine the vast reconstruction which has since taken 
place. It is surprising to say, for instance, that, in 1821, a portion 
of the belt sewer, called the Grand Canal, as at V^ce, was.stdl 
stagnating in the open sky, in the Rue des- Gourdes. It was only m 
1823' that the: city of Paris found iaits pocket the forty-nine ttousMd

or dead. 

His Itrsl sensation was hlitidness. .Siiditenly he saw nothing more. 
It smned to him also that iit one miiuiie he had hecome rleaf. He 
kcard nothing more. The freiiitied storm of inurder whicli w:is rag- 
ing a few feet aliove him only rcaehed him, as we have said, thanks 
to the thickness oi the earth which separated him from it, .stifled 
and indistinct, and like a rumhiing iit ,a great depth. He felt tlwt it 
was solid imrler his feet ; that w.is all ; lint that was enmjgh. i le 
reached out one hand, then the other, ami touched the wall on luith

the air-hole through which he had slipped in, and' his eye became; 
accustomed to this cave. He began to distinguish something. The 
passage in which he was earthed, no other word better expresses 
the condition, was walled up behind him. It was one of those cul-de- 
sacs technically called branchments. Before him, there was another 
wall, a wall of night. The light from the air-hole died out ten or 
twelve paces from the pointat which Jean Valjeari stood, and scarcely 
produced a pallid whiteness over a few yards of the damp wall.of the 
sewer. Beyond, the opaqueness was massive ; to penetrate it appeared 
horrible, and to enter it seemed like being engulfed..He could, how- 
ever, force his way into that wall of mist, and he must do it. He 
must even hasten. Jean Valjean thought that that grating, noticed 
by him under the paving-stones, might also be noticed by the soldiers, 
and that all depended upon that chance. They also could descend 
into the well and explore it. There was not a minute to be lost. He 
had laid Marius upon the ground, he gathered him up, this is again 
the right word, replaced him upon his shoulders, and began his 
journey. He resolutely entered that obscurity. 

The truth i.s, that they were not so safe as Jean Valjean supposed. 
Perils of another kind, and not less great, awaited them perhaps. 
After the flashing whirl of the combat, the cavern of miasmas, and 
pitfalls; after chaos, the cloaca. Jean Valjean had fallen frc:r. one 
circle of Hell to another. 

At the end of fifty paces he was obliged to stop. A question pre- 
sented itsiclf. The passage terminated in another which it met trans- 
versely. These two roads were offered. Which should he take ?-should 
he turn to the left or to the right? Plow guide himself in this black 
labyrinth? This labyrinth, as we have remarked, has a clue: its 
dc.scent. To follow the de.scent is to go to the river. 

Jean Valjean understood this at once. 

lie .said to himself that he was probably in the sewer of the mar- 
kets ; that, if he should choose the left and follow the descent he 
would come in less than a quarter of an hour to some mouth upon 
the Seine between the Pont au Change and the Pont Neuf, that is to 
say, he would reappear in broad day in the most populous portion 
of Paris. He might come out in some gathering of corner idlers.. 
Amazement of the passers-by at seeing two bloody men come out 
of the ground under their feet. Arrival of sergent de ville, call to. 
arms in the next guard-house. He would be seized before getting out. 
It was better to plunge into the labyrinth, to trust to this darkness, 
and to rely on Providence for the issue. 

He chose the right, and went up the ascent. 

When he had turned the comer of the gallery, the distant gleam 
©f the air-hole disappeared, the curtain- of obscurity fell back over 
Win, and he again became blind. He went forward none the less, and 
aft rapidly as he could. Marius' awns were passed about his neck, and

Jean Maljean was now moviuji; was not s(* small as tlie first. Jean 
Vrdjean walked in it with diiViculty. 1 he rains of tlie previous day 
had noi yet rtm idf. aitd made a little stream in the centre of the 
door, and he was ctmipelleil t(» htit; the wall, to ki*ep his feet: out of

was sjreat, hnt the peril of retreat was still greater. He eontinued ta 

advtmce. 

It was not towards the Seine that he was tjoiiit;. I'he stiddlehaek 
which the topogniiihy td' I’aris forms npuii the rijjht liank, empties 
one of its slopes into the Seine and the other into the Hrand Sewer, 
The crest of this stiddle-haek which determines the tlivision of the 
waters follows ti very capricions line, riie cnlminating point, which 
is the |K)int of separation of the Ilow, is in tht* Saint Avoye sewer, 
lieyond the Rtu* Michel de ( 'onite, in the siovcr of the 1 ^ttitvre, near 
the houlevards, and in the Montmartre sewer, near the markets. It 
was at this cnhninatiiif^ pitint that Jean V'alji'an had arrit-ed. l ie 
was makin}j his way towards the belt sewer; he wnis on the riftht 
road. But lie knew nothin}' of it. 

Whenever he came to a branch, he felt its anjth's, iiiul if he Bnmd 
the ojK'ninff not as wide as the corridtjr iii which he wais, he did not 
enter, and continued his rmite, decniiiii' rij.'hlly that every narrower 
way must terminate in a cnl-de-sac, and could only lead' him awny 
from liis object, tin- outlet. He thus evaded the iinadruple snare 
which was spreail for him in the ohscurily, hy the four lahyrintlm 
which we have just emiiiK'taietl. 

At a certain moment he felt that he was }*eftin(i away from tmtler 
the I’ari.s which was petrilied hy the einenie, in wliii h the barricades 
had attpprcsscd the circnlnlion, aiul that he was cumin}' heiieath the 
Paris which was alive ami normal. Me heard .sinlrlenly above hk Iiead 
a sound like thunder, distant, hut cunlinnous. U was the rumbling 
of the vehicles. 

He had been walking for about half an hour, at least hy his own 
calculnliou, and had not yet thmiglit of resting ; only he had changed 
the Iiaml which suiniorted Marius. The darkness was tleeprr than 
ever, !ml this &lt;iepth retissured him. 

All at once he saw his shadow before him. U was marked out on a 
feeble ruddiness almost indistinct, which vaguely enipiirided the 
floor at his feet, and the arch over his he.ad, and which gliiled ahmg 
at his right and his left on the two slimy walls of the corridor. In 
amazement he turned round. 

Behind him, in the prtion of the passage through which he had 
passed, at a distance which appeared to him immense, flamed, throw- 
ing its rays into the dense noscurity, a sort of horrible star which 
appeared to lie looking at him. 

It was the p^loomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer. 
Behind this star were moving without order eight or ten black 
forms, ftraight, iiidtiginct, twrlme. 



JEAN VALJEAN 


107S 


II 

EXPLANATION 

During the clay of the 6th of June, a battue of the sewers had been 
ordered. It was feared that they would be taken as a refuge by the 
vanquished, and prefect Gisquet was to ransack the occult Pai'is, 
while General Bugeaud was sweeping the public Paris ; a connected 
double operation which demanded a double strategy of the public 
power, represented above by the army and below by the police. Three 
platoons of officers and sewermen explored the subterranean streets 
of Paris, the first, the right bank, the second, the left bank, the third, 
in the City. 

'['he officers were armed with carbines, clubs, swords, and dag’ 
gers. • 

I'liat which was at this moment directed upon Jean Valjean, waj 
the lantern of the patrol of the right bank. 

This patrol had just visited the crooked gallery and the three 
blind alk-ys which are beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were 
taking their candle to the bottom of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean 
had come to the entrance of the gallery upon his way, had found it 
narrower than the principal passage, and had not entered it. He had 
pa.sscd beyond. The policemen, on coming out from the Cadran 
gallery, had thought they heard the sound of steps in the direction 
of the belt sewer. It was in fact Jean Valjean ’s steps. The sergeant 
in command of the patrol lifted his lantern, and the squad began to 
look into the mist in the direction whence the sound came. 

This was^ to Jean Valjean an indescribable moment. 

Imckilj, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him badly. It 
wa.s light and he was shadow. He was far off, and merged in the 
blackness of the place. He drew close to the side of the wall, and 
.stopp'-'tl- 

Still, he formed no idea of what was moving there behind him. 
I.ack of sleep, want of food, emotions, 'had thrown him also into the 
visionary state. He saw a flaring flame, and abotit that flame, gob- 
lin.s. What wa.s it? He did not understand. 

Jean Valjean having stopped, the noise ceased. 

The men of the patrol li.stcned and heard nothing, they looked 
and saw nothing. They consulted. 

There was at that period a sort of square at this point of theMont- 
martre sewer, called de service, which has ance been suppressed 
on account of the little interior lake which formed in it, by the dam- 
ming up in heavy storms of the torrents of rain water. The patrol 
could gather in a group in this square. 

Jean ypljean saw these goblins form a kind of circle. These mas- 
tiffs’ heads drew near each other and whispered. 



1076 L K S M I S K R A U I. E S 

The result of this council hclfl liy the walcli-dojrc- 
had been mistaken, that there had hfcn no noise, tliat there was no- 
body there, that it was needless to (rouble (hemselves with the belt 
sewer, tliat that would lie I inu* lost, but that they must hasten towards 
Saint Merry, that if there. wt‘re anylhing to do anti any ‘‘boiisingot’^ 
to track out, it was in that ([uarier. ^ 

From time to time parlies put m*\v soles to their old terms of in- 
sult. In 1832, the wotal bou.un(/of filled the interim lietwecn the word 
jacobin, which was worn out, and the wtiial (icmiujoijuc, then almost 
unused, hut which lias since dmie such exctdleui service. 

The sergeant gave tlic onkv lu file lefl^ towards tlie descent to the 
Seine. If they had conceived the hlea of divi&lt;ling into two squads and 
going in lioth directitms, Jean Valjeau would liave l&gt;ccn •caught. 
That liung liy tin's threail. It is prohahU* that the instructions from 
the irefccture, foreseeing the possibility of a comliat and that the 
insurgents iniglit lie uunierous, f(»rhade the patrol to separate. The 
palroi resumed its march, h‘aviug Jean \ aljcan behind. Of all these 
movements, Jean Valjean i»erct‘ived nothing excejit tlie eclipse of the 
lantern, which sudikmly turned hack. 

^ Before going away, the sergeant, to ease the i.)o!ice conscience, 
discliarged Ids carbine in tlie direciion t!t(*v were abandoning, to- 
wards Jean Valjean. 'fhe detonation rollt‘d from echo to eclio in 
the vatilt like the rumbling of this titanic bowel Some plastering 
wliich fell into the stream anti spattered the water a few steps from 
Jean Valjean made him aware that the hall Inui struck the arch above 
his head. 

Slow and ineastired steins resounded upon tlie floor for some time, 
more and more deadened by the pnigressive increase of the distance, 
the grouji of black forms sank away, a glimmer oscillated and 
floated, making a ruddy circle in the vault, which &lt;lecreased, then dis- 
appeared, the silence Inrame »IiH‘p again, tin* obscurity became again 
Cfimpltde, hliuiiness and ileafness resunu‘il possession of the dark- 
ness ; and jean \'aljean. rmt y&lt;*t daring t&lt;i stir, stood for a long time 
with Ins back to tlie wall, his ear inieiu and eye dilated, watching the 
vanishing of that i&gt;hantom patrol 


in 

THE MAN SimX 

We must do tlie judice tlmt period this justice tliat, even in the 
gravest public conjunctures, it imperuirbably jierformed it.s duties 
watchful and sanitary. An emeute was not in its eyes a pretext for 
giving inalefactiirs a loose rein* and for iu*glecting society because 
the government was in jieril The ordinary duty was performed cor- 
rectly ill addition to the extraordinary duty, and was not disturbed 



JEANVALJEAN 1077 

by it. In the midst of the beginning, of an incalculable political event, 
under the pressure of a possible revolution, without allowing himsell- 
to be diverted by the insurrection and the barricade, an officer would 
‘‘spin’" a thief. 

Something precisely like this occurred in the afternoon of the 
6th of June at the brink of the Seine, on the beach of the right bank, 
a little beyond the Pont des Invalides. 

There is no beach there now. The appearance of the place has 
changed. On this beach, two men some distance apart seemed to be 
observing each other, one avoiding the other. The one who was go- 
ing before was endeavouring to increase the distance, the one who 
came behind to lessen it. 

It was like a game of chess played from a distance and silently. 
Neither seemed to hurry, and both walked slowly, as if either feared 
that by too much haste he would double the pace of his partner. 

One would have said it was an appetite following a prey, with- 
out appearing to do it on purpose. The prey was crafty, and kept on 
its guard. 

The requisite proportions between the tracked marten and the 
tracking hound were observed. He who was trying to escape had a 
feeble frame and a sorry mien ; he who was trying to seize, a fellow 
of tall stature, was rough in aspect, and promised to be rough in 
encounter. 

The first, feeling himself the weaker, was avoiding the second; 
he avoided him in a very furious way ; he who could have observed 
him would have seen in his eyes the gloomy hostility of flight, and 
all the menace which there is in fear. 

The beach was solitary ; there were no passers ; not even a boat- 
man nor a lighterman on the barges moored here and there. 

These two men could not have been easily seen, except from the 
quai in front, and to him who might have examined them from that 
distance, the man who was going forward would have appeared like 
a l)ristly creature, tattered and skulking, restless and shivering 
under a ragged blouse, and the other, like a classic and official per- 
son, wearing the overcoat of authority buttoned to the chin. 

The reader would perhaps recognise these two men, if he saw 
them nearer. 

What was the object of the last? 

Probably to put the first in a warmer dress. 

When a man clad by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in order- 
to make of him also a man clad by the state. Only the colour is thj 
whole question. To be clad in blue is glorious ; to, be clad in red L 
disagreeable. 

There is a purple of the depths^ 

It was probably some inconvenience and some purple of this kind 
that the first desired to escape.

this heap of fragments, which the oilier toiil only to turn. The expe- 



JEAN VALJEAN 1079 

dient would have been puerile. He certainly did not dream of it. 
The innocence of robbers does not reach this extent. 

The heap of rubbish made a sort of eminence at the edge- of the 
water, which prolonged like a promontory, as far as the wail of the 
quai. 

The man pursued reached this little hill and doubled it, so that he 
ceased to be seen by the other. 

The latter, not seeing, was not seen ; he took advantage of this 
to abandon all dissimulation, and to walk very rapidly. In a few 
seconds he came to the mound of rubbish, and turned it. There, he 
stopped in amazement. The man whom he was hunting was gone. 

Total eclipse of the man in the blouse. 

The beach beyond the mound of rubbish had scarcely a length of 
thirty yards, then it plunged beneath the water which beat against 
the wall of the quai. 

The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine nor 
scaled tlia quai without being seen by him who was following him. 
What had become of him ? 

The man in the closely buttoned coat walked to the end of the 
beach, and stopped there a moment thoughtful, his fists convulsive, 
his eyes ferreting. Suddenly he slapped his forehead. He had no- 
ticed, at the point where the land and the water began, an iron grat- 
ing broad and low, arched, with a heavy lock and three massive 
hinges. This grating, a sort of door cut into the bottom of the quai, 
opened upon the river as much as upon the beach. A blackish stream 
flowed from beneath it. This stream emptied into the Seine. - 

Beyond it.s heavy rusty bars could be distinguished a sort of cor- 
ridor arched and obscure. 

The man folded his arms and looked at the grating reproachfully. 

This look not sufficing, he tried to push it ; he shook it, it resisted 
firmly. It was probable that it had just been opened, althoi^h no 
sound had been heard, a singular circumstance with a grating so 
rusty : hut it was certain that it had been closed again. That indicated 
that he before whom this door had just turned, had not a hook but a 
key. 

Thi.s evident fact burst immediately ujwn the mind of the man 
who was exerting himself to shake the grating, and forced from him 
this indignant cpiphonema : ' 

''This is fine ! a government key !” 

Then, calming himself immediately, he expressed a whole world 
of interior ideas by this whiff of monosyllables accented almo^ 
ironically: 

“Weill well! well! well!” 

This said, hoping nobody knows what, either to see the man come 
out, or to see others go in, he posted himself on the watch behind 
the heap of mbbi^, with the patient rt^e of a pointer. ,

For its part, the iiacre, which followed all his movements, had 
halted above him near llic parapet. The driver, foreseeing a long 
stay, fitted the muzzles of his horses into the bag of wet oats, so well 
known to Parisians, to whom the governments, he it said in paren- 
thesis, sometimes apply it. 1'he few passers over the Pont d’lena, be- 
fore going away, turned their he.-uls to look for a moment at these 
two motionless ‘features of tlic landscape, the man on the beach, the 
fiacre on the quai.

noonday .seemed hut moonlight ; ail tlie n;s' was inist, mi.asma, opac- 
ity, blackness. Jean Vaijean was htingry and thirsty ; thirsty espe- 
cially; and this place, like the sea, is one full of vv.ater where you 
Ciimiot drink. lli‘' .strength, which was lu-odigious, .'ind very little 
diminished by age, tlutuks to his eliasie and .solier life, began to give 
way not withstanding. Fatigue grew upon Iiiin. and as his strength 
dirniiiislied tlie weight of his load iiiereaM-d. .Marins, &lt;lead perhaps, 
weighed heavily upon him as inert Itodies do. Jean Vaijean su]i- 
porfed him in stieh a way that his breast was not eornpres.sed and his 
lireuliiing eonld .always l&gt;e as free .as possible, 1 le felt the rapid glid- 
ing of tlie rats between his legs. One of them was so frightened as 
to bite liini. There e.ame to him f roin time to time thnmgh the aprons 
of tile mouths of the sewer a bristth of fresh air which revived him. 

it might liitve been three o’clock in the afternoon when he arrived 
at the belt .sewer. ^ r , , 

l ie wa,s first astonishetl at this sudden enlargement. He abruptly 
found himself in the gallery where his ontsireiehed hiuuls did not 
reach the two w.alls, and under an iircli which his hcaii ditl not touch. 
The Grand Sewer imleeil is eight feet wifle anti .seven^high. 

At tlic jHiint where llte Montmartre sewer jo!n.s the Grand Sewer, 
two other subterranean gallcrku, that of the Kuc de Provence and 
tlwt of the Abattoir, coming in, make a stiuare. Between thew four

took the widest, that is to say, the belt sewer. But there the question “ 
returned : to descend, or to ascend ? He thought that the condition of 
affairs was urgent, and that he must, at whatever risk, now reach the 
Seine. In other words, descend. He turned to the left. 

Well for him that he did so. For it would be an error to suppose 
that the belt sewer has two outlets, the one towards Bercy, the other 
towards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterranean 
belt of the Paris of the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, it 
must be remembei'ed, nothing more nor less than the ancient brook 
of Mcnihnontant, terminates, if we ascend iti in a cul-de-sac, that is 
to say, its ancient starting point, which was its spring, at the foot 
of the hill of Menilmontant. It has no direct communication with 
the branch which gathers up the waters of Paris below the Popin- 
court quart ter, and’ which empties into the Seine by the Amelot sewer 
above the ancient He Louviers. This branch, which completes the 
collecting sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Menilmontant 
even, by a solid wall which marks the point of separation of the 
waters up and down. Had Jean Valjean gone up the gallery, he 
would have come, after manifold efforts, exhausted by fatigue, ex- 
piring, in the darkness, to a wall. He would have been lost. 

Strictly speaking, by going back a little, entering the passage of 
the Fillcs du Calvaire, if he did not hesitate at the subterraneaju 
goose-track of the Boiicherat crossing, by taking the Saint Louis 
corridor, then, on the left, the Saint Gilles passage, then by turning 
to the right and avoiding the Saint Sebastien gallery, he might have 
come to the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided he had not gone 
astray in the sort of F which is beneath the Bastille, reached the out- 
let on the Seine near the Arsenal. But, for that, he musst have been 
perfectly familiar in all its ramifications and in all its tubes with the 
huge madrepore of the sewer. Now, we must repeat, he knew noth- 
ing of thi.s frightful system of paths along which he was making his 
way ; and, had anybody asked him where he was, he would have 
answered: In the night. 

His instinct .served him well. To descend was, in fact, possible 
safety. 

He left on his right the two passages which ramify in the form 
of a claw under the Rue Lafitte and the Rue Saint Georges, and the 
long forked corridor of the Chaussee d’Antin. 

A little beyond an affluent which was probably the branching of 
the Madeleine, he stopped. He was very tired. A large air-hole, 
probably the vista on the Rue d’Anjou, produced an almost vivid 
light. Jean Valjean^ with the gentleness of movement of a brother 
for his wounded brother, laid Marius upon the side bank of the 
sewCT. Marius’ bloody face appeared, under the white gleam from

1083 


V 

FOR SAND AS WELL AS WOMAN THEIUE IS A FINESSE WHICH IS PERFIDY 

He felt that he was entering the water, and that he had under his 
feet, pavement no longer, but mud. 

It sometimes happens, on certain coasts of Brittany or Scotland, 
that a man, traveller or fisherman, walking on the beach at low tide 
far from the bank, suddenly notices that for several minutes he has 
been walking with some difficulty. The strand beneath his feet is 
like pitch ; his soles stick to it ; it is sand no longer, it is glue. The 
beach is perfectly dry, but at every step he takes, as soon as he lifts 
his foot, the print which it leaves fills with water. The eye, however, 
has noticed no change ; the immense strand is smooth and tranquil, 
all the .sand has the same appearance, nothing distinguishes the sur- 
face which is solid from the surface which is no longer so ; the joy- 
ous little cloud of sand-fleas continues to leap tumultuously over the 
wayfarer’s feet. The man pursues his way, goes forward, inclines 
towards the land, endeavours to get nearer the upland. He is not 
aiLvious. Anxious about what? Only, he feels somehow as if the 
weight of his feet increased with every step which he takes. Suddenly 
he sinks in. He sinks in two or three inches. Decidedly he is not on 
the right road ; he stops to take his bearings. All at once, he looks at 
his feet. His feet have disappeared. The sand covers them. He draws 
his feet out of the sand, he will retrace his steps, he turns back, he 
sinks in deeper. The sand comes up to his ankles, he pulls himself 
out and throws himself to the left, the sand is half leg deep, he 
throws himself to the right, the sand comes up to his shins. Then he 
recognises with unspeakable, terror that he is caught in the quick- 
sand, and that he has beneath him the fearful medium in which man 
can no more walk than the fi.sh can swim._ He throws off his load if he 
has one, he lightens himself like a ship in distress ; it is already too 
late, the sand is above his knees. 

lie calls, he waves his hat or his handkerchief, the sand gains on 
him more and more ; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far 
off, if the sandliank is of too ill-repute, if there is no hero in sight, 
it is all over, he is condemned to enlizement. He is condemned to 
that appalling intermentj long, infallible, implacable, impossible to 
slacken or to ha,sten, which endures for hours, which will not end, 
which seizes you erect, free and in full health, which draws you by 
the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at every shout that 
you utter, drags you a little deeper, which appears to punish you for 
yovtf re.sistance by a redoubling of its grasp, which sinks the man 
slowly into the earth while it leaves him all the time to look at the 
horizon, the trees, the green fields, the smoke of the villages in the 
plain, the sails of the ships upon the sea, the birds fl)dng and singing.

JEAN VALJfeAN 1085 

aspliyxia opens its claw in the slime and takes you by the throat ; 
fetidness mingled with the death rattle ; mire instead of sand, sul- 
phuretted hydrogen instead of the hurricane, ordure instead of the 
ocean ? and to call, and to gnash your teeth, and writhe, and struggle, 
and agonise, with that huge city above your head knowing nothing 
ot it all. 

-Ine.xprcssible horror of dying thus ! Death sometimes redeems its 
atrocity by a certain^ terrible dignity. At the stalce, in the shipwreck, 
man may be great ; in the flame as in the foam, a superb attitude is 
po.ssib!c ; you are transhgured while falling into that abyss. But not 
here. Death is unclean. It is humiliating to expire. The last flitting 
vi.sion.s are abject. Mire is .synonymous with shame. It is mean, ugly, 
infamous. 'I'd die in a butt of Malmsey, like Clarence, so be it; in 
the scavenger’s pit, like d’Escoubleau,'that is horrible. To struggle 
within it is hideous ; at the very time that you are agonising, you are 
splashing. There is darkness enough for it to be Hell, and slime 
enough fur it to be only a slough, and the dying man knows not 
whtfther he will become a .spectre or a toad. 

Every wtiere else the grave is gloomy: here it is misshapen. 

'file dejith of th&lt;‘ fontis varied, as well as its length, and its density 
by reason of the more &lt;«• less yielding character of the subsoil. Some- 
times a fontis was three or four feet deep, sometimes eight or ten; 
.sotnetimes no huttttm could lie found. The mire was here almost 
solid, there almost liquid. In the I.uniere fontis, it would have taken 
a man a day to disappear, wliile he would have been devoured in five 
minutes by the Phelippeaux slough. The mire bears more or les.s ac- 
cording to” its greater or less density, A child escapes where a man is 
lost. The first law t&gt;{ safety is to dive.st yourself of every kind of bur- 
den, 'I'o tlirnw away liis bag of tools, or his basket, or his hod; is the 
first thing that every sewerman does when he feels the soil giving 
way beneath him. 

The fonti.s had various causes : friability of the soil ; some crevasse 
at a depth heyotid the reach of man ; the violent showers of summer ; 
the incessant storms of winter ; the long misty rains. Sometimes the 
weight of the neighljotiringhou.ses upon a marly or sandy soil pressed 
out the ardu-s of the subterranean galleries and made them yield, 
or it would happen that the floor gave way and cracked under this 
crushing pressure. The settling of the Pantheon obliterated in this 
manner, a century ago, a part of the excavations on Mount Saint 
Genevieve. When a sewer sank beneath the pressure of the houses, 
the difficulty, on certain occasions, disclosed itself above in the street 
by a kind of saw-tooth separation in the pavement ; this rent was 
developed in a serpentine line for the whole length of the cracked 
arch, and Uien, the evA bemf visible, the remedy could be prompt. 
It olten hajw^ the interior damage w not revealed 

by any ®Ktemr sc4r. And, in that case, woe to the sewermen. Enter- 



1086 LES MISERABLES 

ing without precaution into the sunken sewer, they might perish. The 
old registers make mention of some working-men who were buried 
in this way in the fontis. They give several names ; among others 
that of the sewerman who was engulfed in a sunken slough under 
the kennel on the Rue Car^ne Prenant, whose name was Blaise 
Poutrain; this Blaise Poutrain was brother of Nicholas Poutrain 
who was the last gravedigger of the cemetery called Charnier des 
Innocents in 1785, the date at which that cemetery died. 

There was also that young and charming Vicomte d’Escoubleau 
of whom we have spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lerida* 
where they gave the assault in silk stockings, headed by violins! 
D'Escoubleau, surjirised one night with his cousin, the Duchess de 
Sourdis, was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer in 
which he had taken refuge to escaiKi from the duke. Madame’ de 
&amp;)urdis, when this death was descrilred to her, called for her smell- 
ing-bottle, and forgot to weep through much inhalation of salts. In 
such a ca.se, there is no love which ix-rsists ; the cloaca extinguishes 
it. Hero refuses to wash Lcander’s corpse. Thisbe, stops her nose at 
sight of Pyramus, and says : “Peugh !” 


VI 


THE FONTIS. 

Jean Valjean found him.self in presence of a fontis. 

This kind of settling was then freriuent in the subsoil of the 
Cliamps Elysees, very unfavourable for hydraulic works, and giv^ 
ing poor support to underground constructions, from its excessive 
fluidity. This fluidity surpa.sse.s even that of the .sands of the Saint 
Georges quartier, which could only be ttvercome by stonework upon 
concrete, and the clayey becLs infect(;d with gas in the qtiartier of 
tlie Martyrs, so liquid that the pass.age could be effected under the 
gallery of the martyrs only by meatis of a metallic tube. When, in 
1836, they deniuli.shcii, for the purpo.se of rebuilding, the old stone 
sewer tinder the Faubourg Saint 1 lonore, in which we find Jean 
Valjean now entangled, the tiuicksand, wdiich is the subsoil from 
the Champs Klysccs to the Seine, was such an obstacle that the work 
la.sted nearly .six months, to the great outcry of the bordering pro- 
prietors, especialj.v the proprietors of hotels and coaches. The work 
was more than dimcult ; it was dangerous. It is true that there were 
four months ami a half of rain, and three risings of the Seine. 

The fontis which Jean Valjean fell upon wa.s caused by the show- 
ers of the previous da^y, A yielding of the piavement, imperfectly 
upheld by the underlying sand, had occasioned a damming of the 
rain-water. Infiltration having taken place, sinking had followed. 
The floor, broken up, had disappeared in the mire. For what dis- 



JEAN VAL JEAN 10S7 

tance ? Impossible to say. The obscurity was deeper than anywhere 
else. It was a mudhole in the cavern of night. 

Jean Valjean felt the pavement slipping away under him. He 
entered into this slime. It was water on the surface, mire at the bot- 
tom. He must surely pass through. To retrace his steps was impos- 
sible. Marius was expiring, and Jean Valjean exhausted. Where else 
could he go ? Jean Valjean advanced. Moreover, the quagmire ap- 
peared not very deep for a few steps. But in proportion as he ad- 
vanced, his feet sank in. He very soon had the mire half-knee deep, 
and water above- his knees. He walked on, holding Marius with both 
arms as high above the water as he could. The mud now came up to 
his knees, and the water to his waist. He could not longer turn back. 
He sank in deej^er and deeper. This mire, dense enough for one man’s 
weight, evidently could not bear two. Marius and J ean Valj ean would 
have had a chance of escape separately. Jean Valjean continued to 
advance, supporting this dying man, who was perhaps a corpse. 

The water c,mic up to his armpits ; he felt that he was foundering ; 
it was with difticulty that he could move in the depth of mire in which 
he was. 'J’hc density, which was the support, was also the obstacle. 
He .still held Marius up, and, with an unparalleled outlay of strength, 
he advanced ; but Jie .sank deeper. He now had only his head out of 
the water, and his arms supporting Marius. There is, in the old 
pictures of the deluge, a mother doing thus with her child. 

He sank .still deeper, he threw his face back to escape the water, 
and to be able to Imeathe ; he who .should have seen him in this ob- 
scurity would have thought he saw a mask floating upon the dark- 
ne.ss; he dimly perceived Maiaus’ drooping head and livid face 
above him ; he made a desperate effort, and thrust his foot forward ; 
his foot struck something solid; a support. It was time. 

He rose and writhed and rooted himself upon this support with a 
sort of ftiry. It jiroduced the effect upon him of the first step of a 
.staircn.se reascending towards life. 

This .support, discovered in theihire at the last moment, was the 
heginning of the other slope of the floor, which had bent without 
breaking, and had curved beneath the water like a board, and in a 
single piece. A well-constructed paving forms an arch, and has this 
firmness. 'J'his fragment of the floor, partly submerged, but solid, 
was a real slope, and, once upon this slope, they werp saved. Jean 
Valjean a.scended this inclined plane, and reached the other side of 
the quagmire. 

On coming out of the water, he struck j^inst a stone, and fell 
upon his knees. This seemed to him fitting, and he remained thus 
for some time, his soul lost in unspdken prayer to God. 

He rose, shivering, chilled^ infected, ^digg benea^ thia dying 
man, whom he was draggmg on. all dripping with slime, his soul 
filled with a strange li®ht.

his left, above, the_ Pont cles Invalicles ; the spot would have been 
propitious for awaiting; night and escaping. It was one of the most 
solitary points in I’aris ; the beach which fronts on the Gros C^illou, 
The flip came in and went out tlmough the bars of the grating. 

It might have been half-past eight o’clock in the evening. The day 
was clccliniiig 

Jean Valjcran laid Marius along the wall on the dry part of the 
floor, then walked to the gi-ating and clenched the bars with both 
hands; tfie shtiking was frenzied, the shock nothing. The grating 
did not stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after another, hoping 
to he able to tear out the least solid one, and to make a lever of it to 
lift the d()or or break the lock Nut a bar yielded. A tiger’s teeth are 
not more solid iti their sockets. No lever ; no possible purchase. The 
obstacle was invincilde. No means of opening the door. 

Must he then peri.sh there ? What should he do ? what would be- 
come of them ? go back ; recommeirce the terrible road which he had 
alr(?a&lt;Iy .traversed ; he had not the strength. Besides, how cross that 
quaginire again, from which he had escaped only by a miracle? And 
after the tjuagmire, was there not that police patrol from which, cer- 
tainly, one would not escaiic twice ? And then where should he go ? 
what direction take ? to follow the descent was not to reach the goal. 
.Should he come to another outlet, he would find it obstructed by a 
door or a grating. All the outlets were undoubtedly closed in this 
way. fhaJice had unsealed the grating by which they had entered, 
but evidently all llu; other moutlis of the sewer were fastened. I-Ie 
Iiad only succeeded in escaping into a prison. 

It was ovin". Alt that Jean Valjean had done was useless. Exhaus- 
tion etuUsi in ahortitin. 

They were Imth caught in the gloomy and immense web of death, 
anti Jt'an Valjean fell running over tho.se black threads trembling 
in the darknes.s. the appalling spider. 

lie turned hi.s hack to the grating, and dropped upon the pave- 
ment. rather prostrate than sitting, beside the yet motionless Marks 
anti his head .sank lietween hi.s knees. No exit. This was the last drop 

of angui.sh. • . . , r 

Of wht»m ditl he think in this overwhelming dejection? Neither of 
himself nor of Marius. He thought of Cosette. 


THE TORN COAT-TAIL 

In the midst of this annihilation, a hand was laid upon Ws shoulder, 
and a voice which spoke low, said to him ; 

■ *‘Go halves**'^' ■ »- 

Somebody in that darkness ? No^flng is so like a dream as despair.

JEAN VALJEAN 1093 . 

Thenardier thrust out his under lip with a significant twist of the 
neck. 

“■'I'ou didn’t kill him very dear,” said he. 

He began to handle, in all familiarity, the pockets of Jean Val- 
jean and Marius. Jean Valjean, principally concerned in keeping 
his hack to the light, did not interfere with him. While hewas feel- 
ing of hlariUvs’s coat, Thenardier, with the dexterity of a juggler, 
found means, without attracting Jean Valjean’s attention, to tear 
off a strip, which he hid under his Mouse, probably thinking that 
thi.s scraj) of cloth might assist him afterwards to identify the as- 
sassinated man and the assassin. He found, however, nothing more 
than the thirty f ranc.s. 

“It is true,” sjiid he, “both together, you have no more than that.” 

And, forgetting his words, go halves, he took the whole. 

He lu'silaled a little liefore the big .sous. Upon reflection, he took 
them also, mumbling : 

“No matter ! tliis is to surincr people too cheap.” 

This said, he took the key from under his blouse anew. 

“Now, frientl, you must go out. This is like the fair, you pay on 
going twt. You haw paid, go out.” 

vXiid he liegan to laugh. 

'riiat he had. in extending to an unknown man the help of thir 
key, and in causing another man than himself to go out by this door, 
the pure and disinterested intention of saving an assassin, is some- 
thing which it is jKTmissiblc to doubt. 

'riti'iiardier lidped Jean Valjean to replace Marius upon hia 
shoulders ; then he went towar&lt;ls the gr.'iting upon the points of his 
iKire feet, beckiming to Jean Valjean to follow him, he looked out- 
.side, laid his finger on hi.s mouth, and stood a few seconds as if in 
suspense ; the inspection over, he put the key into the lock. The bolt 
slid and the tloor turned. There was neither snapping nor grinding. 
It was &lt;lonc very quietly. It was plain that this grating and its hinges, 
oiled with care, were ojicned oftener than would have been guessed. 
Tins &lt;iuiet wa.s omino«.s ; you felt in it the furtive goings and com- 
ings, the silent etitrances and exit.s of the men of the night, and the 
wolf-like treail of crime. The sewer was evidently in complicity with 
some mysterious band. This taciturn grating was a receiver. 

Thenardier half opened the door, left just a passage for Jean 
Valjean, closed the grating agwn, turned the key twice in the lock, 
and plunged hack into the obscurity, without making more noise 
than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger. 
A moment afterwards, tihis hidw»U8 prdridence had entered again 
into the invisible. v , ,

h'vening was unfuUling over Jean Valjean’s Iiead all tlie caresses 
of the infinite. 

It was the undecided and exquisite hour which says neither yes 
nor no. Iliere was already ni.eht ennuyji for one to he lost in it at a 
little distance, and still d.iy taiMtieJi for t»ne to he recognised near at

Jean Valjean was for a few secMnd?^ irrc’sistihly overcome by all 
this august ant! caretedng serenity ; there an* such moments of for- 
getfulness; suffering ndiiNes lit liarass the wretched; all is eclipsed 
in thcnight ; [leace covers the dreamer like a night; and, under the 
twilight which is flinging forth its rays, and in imitation of the sky 
wliich is illuminating, the sou! hiromes starry; Jean Valjeau could 
not Imt ga/e at tliai vast clear shadow whitdt was almve him ; pensive, 
he took in the inajcstic silence of the efernal heavens, a bath of 
ecstasy and i»rayer. Hu’in hastily, as if a feeling of duty came back

who was slooning over Marius* 



JEAN VALJEAN 109S 

It was, with the aid of the shadow, a sort of apparition. A simple 
man would have been afraid on account of the twilight, and a re- 
flective man on account of the club. 

Jean Valjean recognised Javert. 

1 he reader has doubtless guessed that Thenardier’s pursuer was 
none other than Javert. Javert, after his unhoped-for departure 
from the barricade, had gone to the prefecture of police, had given 
an account verbally to the prefect in person in a short audience, had 
then immediately returned to .his duty, which implied— the note 
found upon him will be remembered— a certain surveillance of the 
shore on the right bank of the Champs Elysees, which for some time 
liad excited the attention of the police. There he had seen Thenar- 
dier, and had followed him. The rest is known. 

Jt is understood also that the opening of that grating so oblig- 
ingly before Jean Valjean was a piece of shrewdness on the part of 
Tluhiardier. 'J'henardier fdt that Javert was still there ; the man who 
is watched has a scent which does not deceive him ; a bone must be 
thrown to this hound. An assassin, what a godsend 1 It was the scape- 
goat, which nnist never be refused. Thenardier, by putting Jean Val- 
jean out in his place, gave a victim to the police, threw them off bis 
own track, caused himself to be forgotten in a larger matter, _ re- 
wariled Javert for his delay, which always flatters a spy, gained 
thirty francs, and counted .surely, as for himself, upon escaping 
by tile aid of this divenston. 

Ji-an Valjean had pas.sed from one shoal to another. 

These two eneounters, blow on blow, to fall from Thenardier 
upon Javert, it was hard. 

javert did not recognise Jean Valjean, who, as we have said, 
im'longer resemliled lum.self. He did not unfold his arms, he secured 
his club in his grasp by an imperceptible movement, and said in a 
quick and calm voice : 

"Who are you?" 


"What you?” 

"lean Valjean,” , 

Jiivert put the club lictween his teeth, bent lus kriees, inclined ms 
boilv, laid his two powerful hands upon Jean Valjean’s shoulders, 
which they clamped like two vices, examined him, and recognised 
him. Their faces almost touched. Javert’s look was terribk. 

Jean Valjean stood inert under the grasp of Javert like a bon 
who should .submit to the claw of a lynx. ' -j • u- 

‘Tnsiiector Javert," said he, "you lave got me. Besides, since tms 
morning, I have considered myself your prisoner. I did not give 
you my address to try to escape you. Take me. Only grant me one

Javert kept Marius’ pocket-book. 

A moment later, the carriage, descending by the slope of the 
watering-place, was on the beach. Marius was laid upon the back 
scat, and Javert sat down by the side of Jean Valjean On the front 
seat. 

When the (loor was shut, the fiacre moved rapidly off, going* up 
the quais in the direction of the Bastille. 

They left the (ptais and entered the streets. The driver, a black 
silhouette ui)on his box, whipped up his bony horses. Icy silence in 
the coach. Marius, motionless, his body braced in the corner of the 
carriage, his head dropping down upon his breast, his arms hanging, 
his legs rigid, appeared to await nothing now but a coffin ; Jean Val- 
Jean seemed made of slnidow, and Javert of stone; and in that car- 
riage full of night, the interior of which, whenever it passed be- 
fore a lamp, ap])eared to turn lividly pale, as if from an intermittent 
flash, chance grouped to^'ethcr, and seemed dismally to confront 
the three tragic immobilities, the corpse, the spectre, and the. statue. 


X 

RETURN' OF TUB FRODIGAE SON— OF HIS LIFE 
* 

At every j(.)lt over the imvement, a drop of blood fell from Marius's 
hair. 

It was after nightf.all when the fiacre arrived at No. 6, in the Rue 
des h'illes du C’alvaire. 

Jjivert first set foot on the ground, verified by a glance the number 
ai)ove tlie porte-cochere, and, lifting the heavy wrought-iron 
knocker, embellished in the old fashion, with a goat and a satyr 
defying enclt other, struck a •violent blow. The fold of the door 
partly tipeiicd, and Javert pu.shcd it. The porter showed himself^ 
gaping and half-awake, a candle in his hand. 

Everybody in the hoti.se was asleep. People go to bed early 5° 
the Marais, especially on days of feieute. That good old quartier, 
startled by the Revohitian, takes refuge in slumber, as children, 
when they hear Bugaboo coming, hide their heads very quickly 
untler their coverlets. 

Meanwhile Jean Valjean and the driver lifted Marius out of 
the coach, Jean Valjean supporting him by the armpits, and the 
coachman by the knees. 

While he was carrying Marius in this way, Jean Valjean slipped 
his hand under his clothes, which were much tom, felt his breast, 
and assured himself that the heart stiH l»t. It beat even a little less 
feebly, as if the aaotiem of the carriage had determined a certain 
renewal of life.

XI 


COMMOTION IN THE ABSOLUTE 

They did not open their mouths again for the whole distance. 

What did Jean Valjean desire ? I'o finish what he had begun - to 
inform Cosclte, to tell her where L^Xarius was, to give her perhaps 
some other useful information, to make, if he could, certain final 
disjio.sitionH. As to himsidf, as to what concerned him personally, it 
was all oyer ; he had been seized by Javert and did not resist ; another 
than he, in such a condition, would perhaps have thought vaguely of 
that ro{&gt;e which Tlu'nurdier had given him and of the bars of the 
first cell which ho should enter ; but, since the bishop, there had been 
in Jean Valjean, in view of any violent attempt, were it even upon 
his own life, let us repeat, a deep religious hesitation. 

Suicide, that my.stiTiuu.s a.ssault upon the unknown, which may 
contain, iii a certain measure, the death of the soul, was impossible 
to Jean V'aljean. 

At the entrance of the Rue &lt;le rHomme Arm4 the fiacre stopped, 
this street heing too narrow fur carriages to enter. Javert and Jean 
Valjean got out. 

The &lt;lriver Inuuhly represented to monsieur the inspector that 
the Utreclit velvet of his carriage was all stained with the blood of 
the assassin:tted man and with the mud of the assassin. That was 
what he Iiad understooti. He ailded that an indemnity was due him. 
At the same tiine, taking his little book from his pocket, he begged 
monsieur the inspector to have the goodness to write him "a little 
scrap of certificate as to wliat.” 

Javert pushed back the little book which the driver handed him, 
and said : 

“How mudi nuLSt you have, including your stop and your trip?” 

“it is seven hours ami a quarter," answered the driver, “and my 
velvet was hr.'in new. ICighty francs, monsieur the inspector." 

Javert toik four na|)o!eons from his pocket and dismissed the 
fiacre. 

Jean Valjean thought that Javert’s intwition was to take him on 
foot to the post of the Blancs-Mantcaux or to the post of the Ar- 
chive.s which are quite near by. 

They entered the street. It was, as usual, empty. Javert followed 
Jean Valjean. They reached No, 7. Jean Valjean raj^ped. The door 
opened* 

"Very well," said Javert "Go

lenormancl, seeing that they were taking off Marius" clothes, with- 
drew. She began to tell her beads in her room. 

The body had not received any inteidor lesion ; a ball, deadened 
by the pocket-liook, had turned aside, and made the tour of the ribs 
with a hideous gash, but not deep, and consequently not dangerous. 
The long walk underground had completed the dislocation of the 
broken shoulder”l)la(le, and there were serious difficulties there. 
There were sword cuts on the arms. No scar disfigured his face; 
the head, however, was as it were covered with hacks ; what would be 
the result of these wounds on the head? did they stop at the scalp? 
did they affect the skull ? That could not yet be told. A serious symp- 
tom was, that they had caused tlie fainting, and men do not always 
wake from such faintings. The hxunorrhage, moreover, had ex- 
hausted tlie woundt‘d man. ITom the waist, the lower part of the 
body had been protected hy the liarricade. 

Rasque and Nicolette tore up linen and made bandages; Nicol- 
ette sewed tliem, P»a!^iue folded them. There being no lint, the 
doctor slopped the How of blood from the wounds temporarily with 
rolls of wadding, l\y the side of the bed, three candles were burn- 
ing on a table ujiou which tlie surgical instruments were spread out. 
The &lt;loctor wuslied Marius* face and hair with cold water. A bucket- 
ful was ret! in a mtunent. 'Hie pcjrter, candle in hand, stood by. 

Hie [diysician seemed reilecting^ sadly, Ju-om time to time he 
shook his liead, as if he were answering .some question which he had 
put to himstdf internally. A had sign for the patient, these mysterR 
ous dialogues of the physician with himself. 

At the moment the docltir was wiping the face and touching the 
still closed eyelids lightly with liis finger, a door opened at the rear 
end of the parlour, and a long, pale figure approached 

It was the graial father. 

The emente, for two tlays, iiad very much agitate&lt;l, exasperated, 
and ahsorlied M. (lillenonnand. Ife had not slept during tlie pre- 
ceding night, and In* had had a fever all day. At night, ne had gtine to 
bed very early, ret'nmiuending that everything in the house be 
baltt‘d, ami, from fatigue, he luid falUai asleep. 

The shimhers old men are easily broken ; M. Gillenormand*s 
rotim w%as next tlie parlour, and, in spite of tlie precautions they had 
taken, the noise hail awakened him. Surprised by the light which 
he saw at tlie crack of his iloor, he had got out of bed, and groped 
his way along. 

lie Was on the thresliold, one hand on the knob of the half- 
opened door, his head hmi a little feirward and sliaking, his body 
wrapped in a whitt* nightgown, straight and without fohls like a 
shroud ; he was astounded ; and he had the appearance of a phantom 
who is ioi&gt;kirig into a tomb.

JEANVALJEAN 1103 

The physician, who began to be anxious on two accounts, left 
Mai'ius a moment, and went to M. Gillenormand and took his arm. 
The grandfather turned round, looked at him. with eyes which 
seemed swollen and bloody, and said quietly : 

“Monsieur, I thank you. I am calm, I am a man, I saw the death 
of I.ouis XVI., 1 know how to bear up under events. There is one 
thing which is terrible, to think that it is your newspapers that do all 
the harm, ’^'’ou will have scribblers, talkers, lawyers, orators, trib- 
unes, discussions, progress, lights, rights of man, freedom of the 
jircss, and tliis is tlie way they bring home your children for you. 
Oh ! Marius ! it is abominable ! Killed ! dead before me ! A barricade ! 
Oh 1 the bandit ! Doctor, you live in the quartier, I believe ? Oh ! I 
know you well. I see your carriage pass from my window. I am 
going to tell you. You would be wrong to think I am angry. We don’t 
get angry wit h a dead man ; that would be stupid. That is a child I 
brought up. 1 was an old man when he was yct quite small. He played 
at the TuiUifles with his little spade and his little chair, and, so that 
the keeper should not scold, Vilh my cane I filled up the holes in the 
gromwl that he made with his spade. One day he cried; ‘Down with 
Louis XV in !’ and went away. It is not my fault. He was all rosy 
and f:tir. His mother is dead. Have you noticed that all little chil- 
&lt;lrt‘n are fair ? W’liat is the reasoti of it ? He is the son of one of those 
hrigand.s of tlu; Loire; l&gt;nt children are innocent of the crimes of 
their fathers. 1 remt:ml»er when he was as high as this. He could 
not pronounce the d's. His talk was so soft and so obscure that you 
wouUi h:ive thought it was a bird. I recollect that once, before the 
Karriese Hercules, they made a circle to admire and wonder at him, 
that child was so Irji^itiful! It was such a head as you see in pic- 
tures. i sfKike to him in my gruff voice, I frightened him with my 
cane, hut he knew very well it was for fun. In the morning, when he 
came into my mom. I scolded, but it seemed like sunshine to me. You 
can't defend your.self against the.se brats. They take you, they hold 
on to you, they never let go of you. The truth is, tliat there was 
never any amour like that child. Now, what do you say of your 
Lafayette, your Benjamin Con.stant, and of your Tirecuir de Cor- 
celle.s, w!h&gt; kill him for me ! It can’t go on Hke thfe.” 

i le approached Mariu.s, who was still livid and motionless, and to 
whom the iiliysician had returned, and he began to wring his hands. 
The oltl ntjm’s white lips moved a.s if mechanically, and made way 
for almost intiistinet words, like whispers in a death-rattle, which 
couUl scarcely lie heard: “Oh! heartless! Oh! dubbist! Oh! 
scinmdreH Oiif Septembrist !’’ Reproaches whispered by a dying 

man to a corpse. , , . 

! Jttlc by little, as internal eruptions must always make their way 
out, the connection of bis words returned, but the grandfather ap-

pearccl to have lost the strength to utter them, his voice was so dull 
and faint that it seemed to come from tlie otlier side of an abyss; 

“It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, myself. And to 
say that tlun-e is no little cr(‘atnre in ]^'lris wlio would have been glad 
to make the wretch happy! A rascal who. instead of amusing himself 
and enjoying ]if(% went io light and got liimself riddled like a brute! 
And for whom? for what? For iht‘ rejuihlic! Instead of going to 
dance at the Cliaumiere, as young people should! It is well worth 
being twenty years old. 1 'he republic, a deucttd line folly. Poor 
mothers, raise 3 'our pretty h(.n's them. Come, he is dead. That will 
make two funerals under the ])orteH'&lt;Kdiere. 1 'hcn you fixed yourself 
out like tliat for the fine eyes of ( Itmeral I-amar&lt;(uc! What had he 
clone for yoti, (his (.kauTal ! -a.mar(ju&lt;‘ ? A sal)rer ! a hahl)ler ! To get 
killed for a dead man ! H it isidt ennugi*. \o make a man crazy ! Think 
of it! At twenty! And without turning liis head to see if he was 
not leaving somebody behind nim ! Here u&lt;nv are the poor old good- 
men who must die alone. ! \*rish in yutiy eurner, owl ! Well, indeed, 
so mitelt the better, it is what I was ho|&gt;ing, it is going to kill me 
dead I am too ohl, I am a humln'd, I, am a liundred thousand; it is 
a long time since I Itave had a right to be &lt;lt*ad. With this blow, it is 
done. It is all over then, how hwky ! W'hat is the use of making him

BOOK FOURTH— J A VERT OFF THE TRACK

jAVKKT OFF THE TRACK 

jAvrcirr niatle his WMy with slow steps from the Rue cle TITomme 
Armc* 

He walked with his liend down, for the first time in his life, and, 
for the iirst time in Iris life as well, with his hands behind his hack. 

Until tliat day, Javtat liad taken, of the two attitudes of Napoleon, 
only that whii'h ex])resses resolution, the arms folded upon the 
])reasl; that wliidi t*xprt,‘sses uncertainty, the hands behind the 
])aek, was unknown to him. Nt)W, a change had taken place; his 
wlude jxTson, slow and gloomy, bore the impress of anxiety, 

1 hi plunged into the silent streets. 

Still he fijllowisl one direction. 

11(! took the shortest nnile towards the Seine, reached the Quai 
des Ormes, wtait along the ({nai. passed the Grevc, and stopped, at 
a little distance from the post of the Place du Chatelet, at the cor- 
ner of tlie Pont Notre Dame, The Seine there forms between the 
Pont Noire Damti and the Ikmt ait Change h\ one direction, and in 
tlic other between the Ouai de la Megisscrie and the Quai aux Fleurs, 
a sort of siinare lake crossed by a rapid. 

This i)oini of tlie Seine is &lt;lreadcd by mariners. Nothing is more 
dangerous than this nijdd, narrowed at that period and vexed by 
the ]u!es o! the mill of the bridge, since removed. The two bridges, 
so near (?ach oilier,* increase the danger, the water hurrying fear- 
fully under the arches. It rolls on with broad, terrible folds; it 
gathers and lieaps up; the Hood strains at the piles of the bridge 
as if to tear iliem out with huge lk|uid ropes. Men who fall in there, 
one nt*ver st‘es again ; the best swimmers are drowned. 

Javert Ie:uu*d Iiotli elbows on the parapet, with his chin in his 
hands, and while his lingers were clenched mechanically in the 
thickest of liis whiskers, he reflected, 

'riiere had hm\ a new thing, a revolution, a catastrophe in the 
di‘{)ths of his being; and there was matter for self-examinatiom 
javert was suffering frightfully. 

Imr .some hours Javert ha&lt;I ceased to be natural. He was troubled ; 
tins brain, so limpid in, its blindness, had lost its transparency ; there 
was a doiicl in this crystal Javert felt that duty was growing weaker

ill his conscience, and lie could iiol hide it from himself. When he 
hfid so iinex]ie(ied]y met Jerm Valjean upon the hi'ach of the Seine, 
there had heeii in him somethiiif,'' of the wolf, which seizes his prey 
again, and of tlic dug which again finds his master. 

lie saw hcfore him two rornls, hoili equally straight ; hut he saw- 
two : and that terrified him-yhim, who hatl never in his life knoivn 
hut one straight line. Atnl, hitter anguish, these two roads were con- 
tradictory. One of these two straight lines e.xcluded the other. 
Whicli of the two was the true one? 

1 lis coiKiitioii was inespressihle. 

'I'o owe life to a malefactor, to accept th.at debt and to pay it, to 
Ih!, in spite, of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice, and to 
jxiv him for one service with another si-rvice ; to allow him to say: 
“(lO away," and to say to him in turn; *'lk‘ free;’’ to sacrifice duty, 
tliat general ohligatioti, to fUTSoual molivi’s, sind to feel in these per- 
.soiia! motives .something geiiiTal also, and jierhaps stijK'rior; to be- 
tray soidety in order to la* inu* to his own conscience; that all these 
ahsairdities should he realised and that they should he accnmulated 
ttpiHi himself, tliis it w:m by which he was prosiratwl. 

One thitig had astonished him, that jean Valjean had sisared- 
him, and one thing hail petrifieti him, that he, Javert, had spared 
Jean V.aljean. 

Where was he? ife sought himself ,*md fuiiml himself no longer. 
What .shmtld he tlo now ? (live tip jean \‘aljean, that was wrong; 
leave Jean N'aljeati free, that was wrong. In tlie first ease, the man 
of authority would fall lower tlitm the man of the galley ; in the sec- 
ond, a convict rose higher than the law and s«'t his foot upon it. 
In both cases, dishonour to him, Javert. In every course which was 
open to him, there was a fall. Destiny has certain extremities pre- 
cipitous uratn the imixis-sihle, and beyond wltich life i.H no more than 
an al)y.ss. javert was at one of these extremiiie»s. 

One of hi.s causes of anxiety was, that he was compelled to think. 
The very violence of all these contradictory cin’otions forced him to 
it. Thought, an unaccustomed thing to hiin, and singularly minful. 
There is alvimys a certain amount of internal rebellion in tnought; 
and he was irritated at having it within him. 

Thought, upon any subject, no matter what, outside of the narrow 
circle of his ninctions, had been to him, in all ca.ses, a folly and a 
fatigue; but thought upon the day which had Jii.st gone by, was tor- 
ture, He must absolutely, however, kmk into his conscience after such 
shock-s, and render an account of himself to himself, 

What he had just done made him shudder. He had, he, Javert, 
thought good to decide, against all the regulations of tlw police, 
i^ainat the whole social and judida! oivanisation, against tne en- 
tire code, b favour of a release; Uut had pleased him ; he had sub- 
BtkuiMd his own affurs for the public aitairs: ootdd this be d»r- 



JEAN VALJEAN 1107 

acterised ? Every time that he set himself face to face with this name- 
less act which he had committed, he trembled from head to foot. 
Upon what should he resolve ? A single resource remained : to re- 
turn immediately to the Rue de I’Homme Arme, and have Jean Val- 
jean arrested. It was clear that that was what he must do. He could 
not. ' 

Something barred the way to him on tliat side. 

Something? What? Is there anything else in the world besides 
tribunals, sentences, police, and authority ? Javert’s ideas were over- 
turned. 

A galley-slave sacred! a convict not to be taken by justice! and 
that by the act of Javert 1 

That Javert and Jean Valjcan, the man made to be severe, the 
man made to be submissive, that these two men, who were each the 
thing of the law, should have come to this point of setting themselves 
both above the law. was not this terrible ? 

What then ! such enormities should happen and nobody should 
be punished? Jean Valjean, stronger than the entire social order, 
shottld be free and he, Javert, continue to eat the bread of the gov- 
ernment ! 

His reflections gradually became terrible. 

He might also through these reflections have reproached himself 
a little in regard to the insurgent carried to the Rue des Filles du 
Calvatre ; but he did not think of it. The lesser fault was lost in the 
greater. Resides, that insurgent was clearly a dead man, and legally, 
death extinguishes pursuit. 

Jean Valjean then was the weight he had on his mind. 

Jean Valjean confounded him. All the axioms which had been the 
supports of his whole life crumbled away before this man. Jean 
Valjeatr’s generosity towards him, Javert, overwhelmed him. Other 
acts, which he remembered and which he had hitherto treated as lies 
and follies, returned to him now as realities. M. Madeleine reap- 
peare&lt;l behind Jean Valjean, and the two figures overlaid each other 
so as to make but one, which was venerable. Javert felt that some- 
thing horrible was penetrating his soul, admiration for a convict. 
Respect for a galley-slave, can that be possible ? He shuddered at it, 
yet cmthl not'shake it off. It was useless to-struggle, he was reduced 
to confc.ss before his own inner tribunal the sublimity of this wretch. 
That was hateful. 

A beneficent malefactor, a compassionate convict, kind, helpful, 
clement, returning good for evil, returning pardon for hatred, lov- 
ing pity rather than vengeance, preferring to destroy himself rather 
thjin to destroy his enemy, saving him who had stricken him, kneel- 
ing upon the height of virtue, nearer the angels than men. Javert was 
compelled to acknowledge that this monster existed. 

This could not last.

the text of the ccxie, that the imforcueeii would be obeyed, that the 



JEAN VALJEAN 1109 

virtue of a convict might -spread a snare for the virtue of a function- 
ary, that the monstrous might be divine, that destiny had such am- 
buscades as these, and he thought with despair that even he had not 
been proof against a surprise. 

He was compelled to recognise the existence of kindness. This 
convict had been kind. And he himself, wonderful to tell, he had just 
been kind. Therefore he had become depraved. 

He thought himself base. He was a horror to himself. 

Javert’s ideal was not to be humane, not to be great, not to be 
sublime; it was to be irreproachable. Now he had just failed. 

How had he reached that point? How had all this happened? He 
could not have told himself. He took his head in his hands, but it was 
in vain ; he could not explain it to himself. 

He had certainly always had the intention of returning Jean Val- 
jean to the law, of which Jean Valjean was the captive, and of which 
he, Javcrt, was the slave. He had not confessed to himself for a 
single moment while he held him, that he had a thought of letting 
him go. It was in some sort without his knowledge that his hand had 
opened and released him. 

All manner of Interrogation points flashed before his_ eyes. He 
put questions to himself, and he made answers, and his answers 
frightened him. He asked himself : “This convict, this desperate 
man, whom I have pursued even to persecution, and who has had 
me beneath his feet, and could have avenged himself, and who ought 
to have done so as well for his revenge as for his security, in grant- 
ing me life, in sparing me, what has he done? His duty? No. Some- 
thing more. And I, in sparing him in my turn, what hav&amp; I done? 
My duty? No. Something more. There is then something more 
than duty.” Here he was startled ; his balances were disturbed ; one 
of the scales fell into the abyss, the other flew into the sky, and 
Javert felt no less dismay from the one which was above than from 
the one which was below. Without being the least in the world what 
is called a Voltairean, or a philosopher, or a sceptic, respectful on 
the contrary, by instinct, towards the established church, he knew 
it only as an august fragment of the social whole; order was his 
dogma and was enough for him ; since he had been of the age of a 
man, and an official, he had put almost all his religion in the police. 
Being, and we employ the words here without the slightest irony 
and in their most serious acceptation, being, we have said, a spy as 
men are priests. He had a superior, M. pisquet; he had scarcely 
thought, until to-day, of that other superior, God. 

This new chief, God, he felt unawares, and was perplexed thereat. 

He had lost his bearings in this unexpected presence; he did not 
know what to do with this superior; he who was not ignorant that 
the subordinate is bound always to yield, that he ought neither to 
disobey, nor to blame, nor to discuss, and that, in presence of a

JEAN VALJEAN 1111 

an order to the ray to remember the sun; an injunction to the soul 
to recognise the real absolute when it is confronted with the ficti- 
tious absolute; humanity imperishable; the human heart inamis- 
sible ; that splendid phenomenon, the most beautiful perhaps of our 
interior wonders, did Javert comprehend it? did Javert penetrate 
it? did Javert form any idea of it? Evidently not. But under the 
pressure of this incontestable incomprehensible, he felt that his head 
was bursting. 

He was less the transfigured than the victim of this miracle. He 
bore it, exasperated. He saw in it only an immense difficulty of exist- 
ence. It seemed to him that henceforth his breathing would be op- 
pressed for ever. 

To have the unknown over his head, he was not accustomed to that. 

Until now all that he had above him had been in his sight a 
smooth, simple, limpid surface; nothing there unknown, nothing 
obscure ; nothing which was not definite, co-ordinated, concatenated, 
precise, exact, circumscribed, limited, shut in, all foreseen ; authority 
was a plane ; no fall in it, no dizziness before it. Javert had never 
seen the unknown except below. The irregular, the unexpected, the 
disorderly o])ening of chaos, the possible slipping into an abyss; 
that belonged to inferior regions, to the rebellious, the wicked, the 
niiseral)le. Now Javert was thrown over backward, and he was 
abruptly startled by this monstrous apparition : a gulf on high. 

What then ! he was dismantled completely ! he was disconcerted, 
absolutely! In what should he trust? That of which he had been 
convinced gave way 1 

What ! the flaw in the cuirass of society could be found by a mag- 
nanimous wretch I what ! an honest seiwant of the law could find 
himself suddenly caught between two crimes, the crime of letting 
a man escape, and the crime of arresting him ! all was not certain in 
the order given by the state to the official ! There might be blind alleys 
in duty I What then I was all that leal ! was it true that an old bandit, 
weighed down by condemnations, could rise up and be right at last ? 
was this credible ? were there cases then when the law ought, before 
a transfigured crime, to retire, stammering excuses ? 

Yes, there were! and Javert saw it! and Javert touched it! and 
not only could he not deny it, but he took part in it They were reali- 
ties, It was abominable that real facts could reach such deformity. 

If facts did their duty, they would be contented with being the 
proofs of the law ; facts, it is God who sends them. Was anarchy 
then about to descend from on hi|^h? 

So, —and beneath the magnifying power of anguish, and in the 
optical illusion of consternation, all that might have restrained and 
corrected his impression vanished, and society, and the human race, 
and the universe, were summed up henceforth in his eyes in one 
simple and terrible feature— so punishment, the thing judged, the

Javert «lried the fresli ink of the p.-gier, folded it like a letter, 
sealed it, wrote on the hack : Ahdc for the administration, left it or. 
llie laltle, ;ind went out of the mst. The glazed and grated doo» 
cloM'd heliind him. 

I hi again crossed the Place dn Chsitelet diagonally, regained the 
qiiai, and rciiirned with antomatic precision to the very point which 
he had left a tpiarter t»f an hour before, he leaned over there, and 
foniid himself again in the same attitude, on the same stone of the 
parapet. It seemetl as if he had not stirred. 

The ilarkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which 
follows midnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. The sky 
was only an ominous depth. The houses in the city no longer showed 
a single light ; nobody was jassing ; all that he could see of the streets 
and the quais was deserted; Notre Dame and the towers of the 
Palais de Justice seemed like features of the night. A lamp red-

torted in llie mist, one behind the other. 'I’he rains Inul swelled the 
river. 

The place where Javert was leaning was, it will be remembered, 
situated exactly over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly over 
that formidable whirlpool which knots and unknots itself like an 
endless .screw. 

J.avert bent his Jreatl and looked. All was black. Me could distin- 
guish nothing. He heanl a frothing sound; Init he di&lt;l not see the 
river. At intervals, in that giddy ilepth, a gU-ain appeared in dim 
serpentine contortions, the water having titis power, in tlu* most

ing it into at! adder. 1'he glt‘.am vanished, ;ind all hccame ;tg;dn in-

with vapour, suddenly lost to sight, seemeil like an esearptuent td the

BOOK FIFTH 

THE GRANDSON AND THE GRANDFATHER 

I 

IN Wincri WE SEE THE TREE WITH THE PLATE OF ZINC ONCE MORE- 

SoMic lime after the events which we have just related, the Sieur 
BoulatruNle had a vivid emotion. 

The Sieur Boulatruelle is that road-labourer of Montfermeil of 
whom we have already had a glimpse in the dark portions of this 
boolc. 

Boulatruelle, it will perhaps be remembered, was a man occupied 
witli troulilous and various things. He broke stones and damaged 
travellers on the highway. Digger and robber, he had a dream ; he 
believed in treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped 
one day to find money in the ground at the foot of a tree ; in the - 
meantnne, he was willing to search for it in the pockets of the pas- 
,sers-by. ’’ . , , 

Nevertheless; for the moment, he was prudent. He had just had 
a narrow escape. He had been, as we know, picked up in the Jon- 
drette garret with the other bandits. Utility of a vice ; his drunken- 
ness had saved him. It could never be clearly made out whether he 
was there as a robber or as robbed. An order of nol. pros., founded 
upon his clearly proved state of drunkenness on the evening of the 
amlmscade, had set him at liberty. He regained the freedom of the 
woods. He returned to his road from Gagny to Lagny to break 
.stones for the use of the state, under administrative surveillanct^ 
with downcast mien, very thoughtful, a little cooled towards rob- 
bery, which had nearly ruined him, but only turning with the more 
affection towards wine, which had just saved him. 

As to the vivid emotion which he had a little while after his re- 
turn beneath the thatched roof of his road-labourer’s hut, it was tliis : 

One morning a little before the break of day, Boulatruelle, while 
on the way to his work according to his habit, and upon the watch, 
perhaps, perceived a man among the branches, _ whose back only he 
could see, but whose form, as it peemed to him, throt^h tte dis- 
tance and the twilight, was not altogether unknown to him. Boula- 
truelle, although a drunkard, had a correct and lucid memory, an

tUe climbed the beech as high as he could, 

' The idai was good. In eapbring the ioliiiide on the tide where 



JEANVALJEAN 1117 

the wood was entirely wild and tangled, Boulatruelle suddenly per- 
ceived the man. 

Hardly had he perceived him when he lost sight of him. 

The man entered, or rather glided, into a distant glade, masked 
by tall trees, but which Boulatruelle knew very well from having 
noticed there, near a great heap of burrstone, a wounded chestnut 
tree bandaged with a plate of zinc nailed upon the bark. This glade 
is the one which was formerly called the Blaru ground. The heap 
of stones, intended for nobody knows what use, which could be 
seen there thirty years ago, is doubtless there still. Nothing equals 
the longevity of a heap of stones, unless it be that of a palisade fence. 
It is there provisionally. What a reason for enduring ! 

Boulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, let himself fall from the 
tree rather than descended. The lair was found, the problem was to 
catch the game. That famous treasure of his dreams was probably 
there. 

It was no easy matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, 
which make a thousand provoking zigzags, it required a good quarter 
of an hour. In a straight line, through the underbrush, which is there 
singularly thick, very thorny, and very aggressive, it required a long 
half-hour. There was Boulatruelle’s mistake. He believed in the 
straight line ; an optical illusion which is respectable, but which ruins 
many men. The underbrush, bristling as it was, appeared to him the 
best road. 

'T-et us take the wolves’ Rue de RivoH,” said he. 

Botilatruelle, accustomed to going astray, this time made the 
blunder of going straight. 

He threw himself resolutely into the thickest of the bushes. 

He had to deal with hollies, with nettles, with hawthorns, with 
sweetbriers, with thistles, with exceedingly irascible brambles. He 
was very much scratched. 

At the bottom of -a ravine he found a stream which must be 

crossed. ^ ^ . 

He finally reached the Blaru glade, at the end of forty minutes, 
sweating, soaked, breathless, torn, ferocious. 

Nobody in the glade. ^ / -vt t. j 

Boulatruelle ran to the heap of stones. It was in its place. Nobody 

had carried it away. tt . , j 

As for the man, he had vanished into the forest. He had escaped. 
Where ? on which side ? in what thicket ? Impossible to guess. 

And, a bitter thing, there was behind the heap of stones, before 
the tree with the plate of zinc, some fresh earth, a pick, forgotten 
or abandoned, and a hole. 

This hole was empty. . . . 

'^Robber T' cried Boulatruelle, showing both fists to the horizon.

MARIUS, ESCAPING FROM CIVIU WAR, PREPARES FOR DOMESTIC WAR 

Marius was for a long time neither &lt;k‘a(i_ nor alive. Tie luul for 
.several weeks a fever accomiianieci with ileliriuni, anti .serious cere- 
bral .symptoms resulting rather from the concussion jirtjtluced by 
the wouncLs in the head than from the wounds themselves. 

He repeated the name of Cosette during entire nights in the dis- 
mal loquacity of fever and with tlie gloomy obstinacy of agony. 
The size of certain gashes was a .serious danger, the sui&gt;puration of 
large wounds always lieing liable to reiihsorptioii, ami consetpiently 
to kill the patient, under certain atmospheric iniluenccs ; at every 
chaoge in the weather, at the .slightest storm, tlie ph.vsician was anx- 
ious, “Above all, k't the wounded man have no excitement,*’ he re- 
peated. The dressings were complicated and difficult, the fastening 
of cloths and bandages with sparatlrap not being iiiyeiitetl ru that 
period. Nicolette used for lint a slieet “as big as a ctiiling," sai&lt;l she. 
It was not without difficulty that the ehloruretted lotions and the 
nitrate of silver brought the gangrene to an end. As long_a.s there 
was danger, M . Gillenonnaml, in tlesjiair at the bedside if liis grand- 
son, was, like Marius, neither dead nor alive, 

Every day, and sometimes twiia* a day, a very well-dressed gen- 
tleman with white hair, such was the description given by the porter, 
came to inquire after the wotuideil man, ami left a large package of 
lint for the dressings. 

At last, on the 7th of Septemlicr, four months, to a day, after the 
sorrowful night when they had brought him home tlying to his grand- 
father, the physician declared him out of danger. Convalescence be- 
gan. Marius w.is, however, obliged still to remain for more than 
two months .stretched on a long ehair, on account of tin* accidents 
resulting from the fracture of the slioulder-hlade. There is alway.s 
a last wound like this which will not close, and which prolongs llie 
dressings, to the great disgust of the jxuient. 

However, this long sickness and this long convalescence .saved 
him from pursuit. In France, there is no anger, even governmental, 
which six months does not extinguish. Enteutes, in the jiresent state 
of society, are so much the fault of everybody tlmt they are followed 
by a certain necessity of closing the eye.s. 

Let us add that the infamous Gisquet order, which enjoined phy- 
sicians to inform against the wounded, having outraged public opin- 
ion, and not only public opinion, but the king nrst of all, the wounded 
Were shielded and protected by this indignation: and, with the ex- 
ception of those who had been taken prisoners in actual combat, the 
courts-martial dared not disturb any. Marias was therefore left in 
'peac&amp;,' 



JEAN VALJEAN 1119 

M. Gillenorniancl passed j&amp;rst through every anguish, and then 
every ecstasy, Ihey had great difficulty in preventing him from 
passing every night with the wounded man; he had his large arm- 
chair ))rought to the side of Marius^ bed ; he insisted that his daugh- 
ter slioitld take the^ finest linen in the house for compresses and 
1)anda,gt‘s, Mademoiselle Gillenormand, like a prudent and elder 
person, found means to spare the fine linen, while she left the grand- 
father to siqipose that he was obeyed, M. Gillenormand did not per- 
mit an}d)ody to explain to him that for making lint cambric is not so 
good as coarse linen, nor new linen so good as old. He superintended 
all the dressings, from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly 
absented herself. When the dead flesh was cut with scissors, he 
wtathl say : mcT Nothing was so touching as to see him hand 

a cup (d gruel to tlie wounded man with his gentle senile trembling, 
l ie (overwhelmed the doctor with questions. He did not perceive that 
he. always asked tlie same. 

On the djiy tlie physician announced to him that Marius was out 
of &lt;langer, tlie goodman was in delirium. He gave his porter three 
Itnus as a gratuity. In tlie evening, on going to his room, he danced 
a gav(»t» making castanets of his thumb and forefinger, and he sang 
a song which follows : 


Teannc est nee h Fougere, 
\'rai aid (rune btjrgere; 
J'luiore stm jupon, 
lu’ipoii. 


Amour, lu vis cn die; 

('ar de.Ht dans sa prundle 
Qm tu niets ton carcinois, 
Xurquois t 


Moi, jc la cimnte. et j'aimc, 
Plus que Diane meme, 
Jeanne et ses dura tetons 
Bretons. 


Then he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who watched him through 
the hal f-open door, was certain that he was praying. 

Hitherto, he had hardly believed in God. _ 

At each new phase of improvement, which continued to grow 
more itnd more visible, the grandfather raved. He did a thousand 
mirthful tilings mechanically ; he ran up and down stairs wimoul 
knowing why. A neighbour, a pretty woman withal, was amazed at 
receiving a large bououet one morning | it was m 
ii«mf k to her. The husband made a scene. M. Gulenormand at-

He did not hide the obstacles from himself. 
l«t us emphasise one point here : he was not won over, and was 
little softened \n ail thesolicitadeand all the tetideniess of his graiid- 
father. In the first place, he was nut in the secret of it all ; ilien. In 
his skk man's revenea, still feverish perhaps, he distrusted this gen* 
tioness as a new and atrange Uung, the dhiect of wliicb was to sub« 
due him. He remained cold. The grandfatner expended his poor old 
for nothing. Marins said to lumaelf it WM svell so long as he.

grandfather’s real attitude would be unmasked. Then it would be 
harsh recrudescence of family questions, every sarcasm and every 
objection at once: bauchelevcnt, Coupelevent, fortune, poverty, 
misery, the stone at the neck, the future. Violent opposition; con- 
clusion, refusal. Marius was bracing himself in advance. 

And then, in proportion as he took new hold of life, his former 
grie 1 s reappeared, the old ulcers of his memory reopened, he thought 
once more of the past. Colonel Pontmercy appeared again between 
M. (lillenorinand and him, Marius ; he .said to himself that there was 
no real goodness to be hoped for from him who had been so unjust 
and so hard to his father. And with health, there returned to him a 
sort of har.shnesH towards his grandfather. The old man bore it with 
gentleness. 

M_. ( jillenonnand, without manifesting it in any way, noticed that 
Mtirins, since he liad been brought home and restored to conscious- 
ness, had not once said to him “father.” He did not say monsieur, it 
is true ; hut lie found means to say neither the one nor the other, by 
a cerlaiimuanner of turning his sentences. 

A ensis was evidently approaching. 

As it tdmost tilways happens in similar cases, Marius, in order to 
try himself, skirmished before offering battle. This is called feeling 
the ground. One morning it liappened that M. Gillenormand, over 
a newsiKiper which had fallen into his hands, spoke lightly of the 
Copvcnlion aiul di.schargecl a royali.st epiphonema upon Danton, 
Saint Just, and Robespierre. “The men of ’93 were giants,” said 
Mariu.s, .sternly. The old man was silent, and did not whisper for the 
rest of the day. 

Marins, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grand-" 
father of his early years, .saw in this .silence an intense concentration 
of anger, augured from it a .sharp conflict, and increased his preparar" 
tions for combat in the inner recesses of his thought. 

He determined that in case of refusal he would tear off his ban- 
dages, dislocate his .shoulder, lay bare and open his remainii^ 
Wiiunds, and refuse all nourishment. His wounds were his ani- 
munitioii. 'I'o have Cosette or to die. 

1 le waited fur the favourable moment with the crafty isatience of 
the sick. 

Tlrnt moment came.

MARIUS ATTACKS 

One day M. Gillenormand, while his daughter whs putting in order 
the vials and the cups utoo the marble top of the bureau, bent ovei 
Marius and said to him in his most tender tone: 



1122 LES MIsfjKABEKS 

“Do you see, niy darling Marius, in your place I would eat meat 
now rather than fish. A fried sole is e.\celjent to begin a convales- 
cence, but, to put the sick man on his legs, it takes a good cutlet.” 

Marius, nearly all whose strength had returned, gathered it to- 
gether, sat up in bed, rested his clenched hands on the sheets, looked 
his grandfather in the face, assumed a terrible air, and said : 

“This leads me to sav something to you.” 

“What is it?” 

“It is that I wish to marry.” 

“Foreseen,” said the grandfather. An&lt;i he Intrst out laughing. 

“How foreseen?” 

“Yes, foreseen. You .shall have Iut, your kissie." 

Marius, astounded, and overwhelmed by the dazzling burst of 
happiness, trembled in every lintli. 

M. Gillernormatid continued: 

“Ye.s, you shall have her, your handsome, pretty little girl. She 
comes every day in the .shape of an old gentleman to int|itire after 
you. Since yon were woundetl. she h.as passtsl her I hue in weeping 
and making lint. I have made imiuiry. She lives in the Hue de 
ITIammc Anne, Numlier Seven. .Mi, we arc ready! ,\lt! you wttnt 
her! Well, you .shall have her. That caielies y«tu. \'on hud iirranged 
your little plot ; you .said to yourself : J am going to make it known 
bluntly to that grandfather, to tiiat niitmmy of llu* Regency and of 
the Directory, to that old bean, to thtit Doraule Iiecome a (leronte; 
he has had his levitie.s t«.K), him.sclf, and his amours, .and his gris- 
ettes, and his Cosettes ; he has made his display, he has had his wings, 
he has eaten his spring bread ; he must naneinber it well. W'e shall 
see. Battle. Ah 1 you take the Img hy the horns, 'i'liat is good. I pro- 
pose a cutlet, and you answer : *A projHi.s, 1 wish to ntnrry.’ That is 
what I call a transition. Ah! you had reckoned iipou some bickering. 
You didn’t know that I was an okl cowtird. What do you .say to that ? 
You are spited. To find your grandfather still more .stitnid than 
yourself, you didn't exjiect that, you lose the argument which you 
were to have made to me, monsieur advocate ; it is provoking. Well, 
it is all the same, rage. Ido what you wish, that cuts you out of it, 
idiot. Listen. I have made inquiries, 1 am sly too; she is charming, 
she is modest, the lancer is not true, she has made licaps of lint, she 
■is a jewel, she worships you ; if you had died, there would have been 
three of us; her bier would have accbmjianied mine. I had a strong 
notion, as soon as you were better, to plant her square at your bed- 
side, but it is only in romances that they introduce young girls un- 
ceremoniously to the side of the couch of the pretty wounded men 
who interest them. That does not do. What would your aunt have 
aidd? You have been quite naked three-quarters of the time, ray 
goodman. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you a minute, if it was pos- 
sible fpr a woman to be l»re. And then what wouki tlie dot^r nave 



jeanvaLjean 1123 


said ? That doesn’t cure a fever, a pretty girl. Finally, it i^all right ; 
don’t let us talk any more about it, it is said, it is done, it is fixed ; 
take her. Such is my ferocity. Do you see, I saw that you did not 
love me ; I .said : What is there that I can do, then, to make this 
animal love me ? I said : Hold on ! I have my little Cosette under my 
hand ; I will give her to him, he must surely love a little then, or let 
him tell why. Ah ! you thought that the old fellow was going to 
storm, to make a gruff voice, to cry No, and to lift his cane upon 
all this dawn. Not at all. Cosette, so be it; love, so be it ; I ask noth- 
ing better. Monsieur, take the trouble to marry. Be happy, my dear 
child.” 

This said, the old man burst into sobs. 

And he took Marius’ head, and he hugged it in both arms against 
bus old breast, and they both began to weep. That is one of the forms 
of supreme happiness. 

“]''ather !” e.xdaimed Marius. 

“Ah ! you love me then !” said the old man. 

There was an ineffable moment. They choked and could not speak. 

At last the old man stammered : 

“Come ! the ice is broken. He has called me, ‘Father.’ ” 

Marius rdeased'his head from his grandfather’s arms, and said 
.softly: 

“Btit, father, now that I am well, it seems to me that I could see 
her.” 

“Foreseen again, you shall see her to-morrow.” 

“]&lt;'athcr !” 

“What?” 


“Why not to-day?” 

“Well, to-day. Here goes for to-day. You have called me ‘Father," 
three times, it is well worth that. I will see to it. She shall be brought 
to you. Foreseen, I tell you. This has already been put into verse. It 
is the conclusion of Andr6 Chenier’s elegy of the Jeune malade, 
Andre Ch&amp;iier who was murdered by the scound — by the giants 


M, Gilenormand thought he perceived a slight frown on Manus 
brow, although, in truth, we should say, he was no longer listening 
to him, flown off as he had into ecstasy, and thinking far ir 
Cosette than of 1793. The grandfather, trembling at hayin' 
duced AndrI Chenier so inopportunely, resumed precipita 
“Murdered is not the word. The fact is that the great re’ 
ary geniuses, who were not evil disposed, that is incontr-' 
were heroes, egadl found that Andr6 Chenier embarra 

little, and they had him guillot . That is to say that those gr&lt;at 

men, on the seventh of Thermidor, in the interest of the public 

safety, begged Andr6 Chinier to have the kindness to go .

Mother Gigogne. So, marry, beauties. I really don’t see the good 
of being an old maid. I know very well that they have a chapel apart 
in the church, and that they talk a good deal about the sisterhood 
of the Virgin; but, zounds, a handsome husband, a fine fellow, 
and, at the end of the year, a big flaxen-haired boy who sucks you 
merrily, and who has good folds of fat on his legs, and who 
squeezes your Ijreast by handfuls in his little rosy paws, while he 
laughs like the dawn, that is better after all than .holding a taper at 
vespers and singing Turns eburnear 

'I'lie grandfather executed a pirouette upon his ninety year old 
heels, and began to talk again, like a spring which flies back : 

Ainsi, lioniaiit 1« cours clc tes rCvasseries. 

Akipiie, il est done vrai, dans peu tu te maries. 

“Bv the way !” 

“V\diat. father?"

“^'es, Cunrfeyrac.” 

“What has iKTome of him?” 

“He is dead." 

“Very well." 

lie s;U tlown near them, made Cosette sit down, and took their 
four hands in his old wrinkled hands : 

“She is ex([uisite. this darling. She is a masterpiece, this Cosette 1 
She is a very little girl and a very great lady. She will be only a 
barones.s, that is stooping ; she was born a marchioness. Hasn’t she 
lasht's for you ? My children, fix it well in your noddles that you are 
in tlie right of it. Love one another. Be foolish about it. Love is the 
f(HiIi.slniess of men, and the wisdom of God. Adore each other. 
Only," added he, suddenly darkening, “what a misfortune! This is 
what 1 am thinking of! More than half of what I have is in an- 
nuity ; as long as I live, it’s all well enough, but after my death, 
twenty years from now, ah ! my poor children, you will not have a 
sou. V’our beautiful white hands, Madame the Baroness, wdl do the 
devil the homnir to pull him by the tail." 

**Ma&lt;!emoisdle Euphrasie Fauchelevent has six hundred thou-

that he was there, and he stood erect and motionless behmd all these

which we have spoken. He had a pickaxe somewhere in the bushes, 
in a hiding-place known only to himself. When he saw Marius con- 
valescent, feeling that the hour was approaching when this money 
might be useful, he had gone after it; and it was he again whom 
Boulatruelle saw in the wood, but this time in the morning, and not 
at night. Boulati'uclle, inherited the pickaxe. 

I'he real sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand five 
hundred francs. Jean Valjean took out five hundred francs for 
himself. _“_We will see afterwards,” thought he. 

'J'he difference between this sum and the six hundred and thirty 
thousand francs withdrawn from I^ffitte’s represented the ex- 
penses of tell years, from 1823 to 1833. The five years spent in the 
convent had cost only five thousand francs. * 

Jean Valjean put the two silver candlesticks upon the mantel, 
where they shone, to Toussaint’s great admiration. 

Moreover, Jean Valjean kneiitr that he was delivered from Javert. 
It had been mentioned in his presence, and he had verified the fact 
in the Monitcur, which published it, that an inspector of police, 
nanK'd Javert, had been found drowned under a washerwoman’s 
boat between the Pont an Change and Pont Neuf, and that a papef 
left liy this man, otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed 
by his chiefs, led to a belief that he had committed suicide during 
a fit of mental aberration. “In fact,” thought Jean Valjean, “since 
having me in his power, he let me go, he must already have been 
crazy.”

Till? TWO OU) MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH IN IIIS OWN WAY, THAT 
COSHTTE MAY BE HAPPY 

Ar.,i. the preparations were naade for the marriage. The physician 
litfing consulted said that it might take place in February. This was 
in December. Some ravishing weeks of perfect happiness rolled 
away. 

'['he least happy was not_ the grandfather. He would remain 
for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette. 

“The wonderful pretty girl 1" he exclaimed. “And her manners 
are so sweet and so good. It is of no use to say my love my heart, 
she is the most charming girl that I have ever seen in my life. Be- 
sides, .she will have virtues for you sweet as violets. She is a grac^ 
indeed! You can but live nobly with such a creature. Marius, my 
boy, you arc a baron, you are rich, don’t pettifog, I beg of you.^ 
Cosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the grave to parar. 
(Rse. There had been but little caution in the transition, and they 
would have been stunned if they had not been dazzled, 

“Do you understand anything about it?” said Marius to Cosetta,

As for the live hundred and eiuhty-toiir thonsuinl francs, that was 
a legacy left to foselie hy a dead per&gt;»in who desired to remain un- 
known, TTie original legacy had heen live hnwired and ninety-four 
thousand francs; hut Wit ilioiis,and francs had heen expended for 
Mademoiselle hanihrasie's education of which live thmisawl francs 
were jwid to iheconvent ilM’lf. This legacy, deposited in the lumdsof 
a Ihinl party, was to he given up to i o-eite at her majority or at 
the time of her marriage. ■•Mtogether this was very acceptable, as 
we .see, especially with n hasis of more than half .i million. There 
were indeed a few siiigiilariiies here awl there, hut nohtKiy saw 
them ; one of those interested had his eyes InuKlaged by love, the 
other liy the six lumdred thousand francs. 

Cosettc lejtrned lliat she was jioi the daughter of that old man 
whom she Iwtd so long v.il!ed father. 1 ie was only tt relative ; another 
FaucheleveiU w.ts her real father. At any other time, this would 
have broken Iter lieart. But at this inetyahle hour, it was only a little 
shadow, a (larkening, and .she had so imich joy that thi.s cloud was 
of short duration, She had Marius. The young man came, the good- 
man faded away; such is life. 

And then, Cosetic had Iwcn acciisiomt'd for lon]^ years_ to see 
enigmas almut her; everybody who has had a mysterious childhood 
is always ready for certain renunciations. 



JEAK VALJEAN 1131 

• She contmiied, however, to say “Father'’ to Jean Valjeaii. 

* Cosette, in raptures, was enthusiastic about Grandfatlier Gille- 
normand. It is true that he loaded her with madrigals and with 
presents. While Jean Valjean was* building .a normal condition in 
society for Cosette, and a possession of an unimpeachable state, M. 
Gillenorniand was watching over the wedding corbeille. Nothing 
amused him so much as being magnificent. He had given Cosette. 
a di"ess of Binche guipure which descended to him from his own 
grandmother. “These fashions have come round again," said he, 
“old things are the rage, and the young women of my bid age dress 
like the old women of my childhood." 

He rifled his respectable round-bellied bureaus of Coromandel 
lac which had not been opened for years. “Let us put these dowagers 
to the confession," said he ; “let us see what they have in them," He 
noisily stripped the deep drawers full of toilets of all his wives, of 
all his mistresses, and of all his ancestresses. Pekins, damasks, 
laini)as, painted moires, dresses of gros de Tours, Indian handker- 
chiefs embroidered with a gold which could be washed, dauphines 
in the piece finished on both sides, Genoa and Alen^on point, antique 
jewellery, comlit-boxes of ivory ornamented with microscopic bat- 
tles, clothes, riI)I)ons, he lavished all upon Cosette. Cosette, as- 
tonished, desperately in love with Marius and wild with gratitude 
towards M. Gillenorniand, dreamed of a boundless happiness clad 
in satin and velvet. Her wedding corbeille appeared to her upborne 
l)y seraphim. Her soul soared into the azure on wings of Mechlin 
lace. 

The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have said, 
by the ecstasy of the grandfather. It was like a flourish of trumpets 
in the Rue des T^illes du Calvaire. 

Every morning, a new offering of finery from the grandfather to 
Cosette. Every possible furbelow blossomed out splendidly about 
her. 

One day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of 
his happiness, said in reference to I know not what incident: 

“The men of the revolution are so great that they already have 
the ].)reslige of centuries, like Cato and like Phocibn, and each of them 
seems a memoirs? (antique memory) 

“Moire antique!" exclaimed the old man. “Thank you, Marius. 
That is }&gt;recisely the idea that I was in search of." 

And the next day a magnificent dress of tea-coloured moire an- 
tique was added to Cosette’s corbeille. 

The grandfather extracted a wisdom from these rags : 

“Love, all very well ; but it needs that with it. The useless is 
needed in happiness. Happiness is only the essential. Season it for 
me enormously with the superfluous. A palace an&lt;L her heart. Her 
heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand fountains of Ver^

llicy tloii't know how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret the pretty 
ways of I lie old times. 1 regret the whole of them. That elegance, 
that chiv.alry. those courtly and dainty ways, that joyous luxury 
which everyliudy liad, music making part of the wedding, symphony 
above, drumming below, dances, joyful faces at table, ‘far-fetched 
njadrigafs, songs, squibs, free laughter, the devil and his train, 
big knots of ribbon. 1 regret the bride’s garter. The bride’s garter 
is cousin to the cestus of Venus. Upon what turns the war of Troy? 
15y heavens, upon Helen's garter. Why do they fight, why does 
Diomede the ilivine shatter that great bronze helmet with ten points 
on Meriones’ head, wliy do Achilles and Hector pick each other 
willi j'.reat ]tike thrusts? Becau.se Helen let Paris take her garter. 
With t oseite's garter, Uonier would make the Iliad. He would put 
into his jioem an old balililer like me, and he would call him Nestor. 
Mv frietnls, formerly, in that lovely formerly, people married scien- 
tilicidly : tliey matle a good contract, then a good jollification. As 
sooti as I'lijas went out, (iamache came in. But, forsooth! the- 
stomach is .-ui agreeable animal which demands its due, and which 
wants its wedding also, 'fhey .supped well, and they had a beautiful 
neigliliour at table, without a stomacher, who hid her neck but mod- 
erately ! t )li ! the wide laughing mouths, and how gay they were in 
those times 1 h'outh was a lunuiuct ; every young man terminated in 
a Itr:incli of lilae or a hunch of roses; was one a warrior, he was a 
shepliertl ; and if, l»y chance, lie was a captain of dragoons, he found 
.sonu- w;iv to lie ea’lled i•■lorian. They thought everything of being 
pretty, thev emhroiileretl themselves, they empurpled themselves, 
A bourgeois had tlie appearance of a flower, a marquis had the ap- 
pvaranee of ,1 precious stone. They did not wear straps, they did not 
we.-ir hoots. They were flaunting, glossy, moire, gorgeous, flutter- 
itig. daiutv, emiueUish, which -did not prevent them from having a 
sword al t heir side. The humming bird has beak and claws. That was 
th&lt;- time of the htda galantcs. One of the sides of the century was 
the delic.-ite, the other was the magnificent; and, zookers! they 
ninnsril theuiseive.s. Nowadays, they are serious. The bourgeois is 
miserly, the liourgeois is prudish; your century is unfortunate. 
Pei .pie would drive away the Graces for wearing such low necks.

While the grandfather, in full lyrie elfusioii, w.as listening to liim- 
Bclf, Cosettc and Marius were ii'iiosnaied with seeing eaeli oilier 
freely. 

Aunt Gillenormniul beheld it all with her iiu|ieriurai&gt;le itlneidity. 
She had Itatl within five or six months a cerinin mmilier of emotions ; 
Marius returned,^ Marius brought liaek hlccdirtg, Marius hrought 
back from a barricade, Klarins dead, then alive, Marius reconciled, 
Marius bethrothed, Marius marrying a {MUfirr, Marius marrying 
a millionaire. The six hundred thou.san&lt;{ francs had !»een her last 
surprise. Then her first communicant indifTerence returned to her. 
She went regularly to the offices, picked over her rosary, read her 
prayer-lmk, whi!»|»red j^vfi in one part of the house, while they

catastrophes, no human impressions, neither pleasant impressions, 
nor painful impressions. 'This devotion,” said Grandfather Gille- 
normand to his daughter, "corresponds to a cold in the head. You 
smell nothing of life. No bad odour, but no good one.” ' 

Still, the six hundred thousand francs had determined the hesi^ 
tation of the old maid. Her father had acquired the habit of counting 
her for so little, that he had not consulted her in regard to the con- 
sent to Marius’ mandage. He had acted with impetuosity, accord- 
ing to his wont, having, a despot become a slave, but one thought, to 
satisfy Marius. As for the aunt, that the aunt existed, and that she 
might have an opinion, he had not even thought ; and, perfect sheep 
as she was,- this had ruffled her. A little rebellious inwardly, but 
outwardly impassible, she said to herself : "My father settles the 
question of the marriage without me, I will settle the question of 
the inheritance without him.” She was rich, in fact, and her father 
was not She had thei*efore reserved her decision thereupon. It is 
probalde that, if the marriage had been poor, she would have left it 
poor. So much the worse for monsieur, my nephew ! He marries a 
beggar, let him be a beggar. But Cosette’s half-million pleased the 
aunt, and changed her feelings in regard to this pair of lovers. Some 
consideration is due to six hundred thousand francs, and it was clear 
that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young 
people, since they no longer needed it. 

It was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather. 
M, Gillenormand absolutely insisted upon giving them his room, 
the finest in the house. mil rejxivenate me/' he declared. ''It is 
an old project. I aki^ays had the idea of making a zvedding in my 
room/' He filled this room with a profusion of gay old furniture. He 
hung the walls and the ceiling with an extraordinary stuff which he 
had in the piece, and which he believed to be from Utrecht, a satin 
background with golden immortelles, and velvet auriculas. "With 
this stuff,” said he, "the Duchess d'Anville’s bed was draped at La 
Roche Guyon.” He put a little Saxony figure on the mantel, holding 
a muff over her naked belly. 

M. Gillenormand’s library became the attorney’s office which Mar- 
ius required ; an office, it will be remembered, being rendered neces- 
sary by the rules of the order.

THE EFFECTS OF DREAM MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS 

The lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M,

lenormand, "that the intended should come to the house tc 
like this.” But Marius’ convalescence had led to the hab)

^ And himself, was he really the same man? He, the poor, he was 
rich ; he, the abandoned, he had a family ; he, the despairing, he was 
marrying Cosette. It seemed to him that he had passed through a 
tomb, and that he had gone in black, and that he had come out 
white. And in this tomb, the others had remained. At certain mo- 
ments, all these beings of the past, retumed and present, formed a 
circle about him and rendered him gloomy ; then he thought of Co- 
setle, and again Ijccume .serene ; but it required nothing less than this 
felicity to clTace this catastrophe. 

M_. h aiichelevent almost had a place among these vanished beings. 
Marius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade 
was the .same as this^ Fauchelevent in flesh and blood, so gravely 
seated near Cosette. 1 he first was probably one of those nightmares 
coming and going with his hours of delirium. Moreover, their two 
natures showing a steep front to each other, no question was possible 
froin Mariu.s to M. 1* aiichelevent. 3.'he idea of it did not even occuf 
to jiim. Wc have already iiulicatcd this characteristic circumstance. 

'I'wo men who have a common secret, and who, by a sort of tacit 
agreement, do not exchange a word upon the subject, such a thing 
is less rare than one would think. 

_ Once only, Marius made an attempt. He brought the Rue de la 
Chanvrerie into the conversation, and, turning towards M. Fau-. 
chelevent, he said to him : 

"You are well acquainted with that street?” 

"What street ?” 

"The Rue de la Chanvrerie.” 

**T have no idea of tlie name of that street,” answered M. Fauch- 
elevont in the most natural tone in the world. 

The answer, which liore upon the name of the street, and not 
upon the street itself, appeared to Marius more conclusive than it 
was. 

" Decidedly,” thought he, “I have been dreaming. I have had a hal- 
lucination. It was somebody who resembled him. M. Fauchelevent 
was not there.” 


vni 

TWO MEN IMPOSStBLE TO FIND 

The enchantment, great as it was, did -not efface other preoccupa- 
tions from Marius’ mind. 

During the preparations for the marriage, and while waiting for 
the time fixed upon, he had some difficult and careful retrospective 
researches made. 

He owed gratitude on several sid«, he owed some on his father’s 
account, he owed some on his own.

he had been '^stationed/’ from three o’clock in the afternoon until 
night, on the qtiai of the Champs Elysees, above the outlet of the 
Grand Sewer ; that, about nine o’clock in the evening, the grating 
of the sewer, which overlooks the river beach, was opened ; that a 
man came out, carrying another man on his shoulders, who seemed 
to be^ dead ; that the officer, who was watching at that point, arrested 
the living man, and seized the dead man ; that, on the order of the 
officer, he, the driver, received ^‘all those people” into the fiacre ; 
that they went first to the Rue des Filles du Calvaire ; that they 
left the dead man there ; that the dead man was Monsieur Marius, 
and that^ he, the driver, recognised him plainly, although he was 
alive **this time that they then got into his carriage again ; that he 
whipped up his horses ; that, within a few steps of the door, of the 
Archives, he had been called to stop ; that there, in the street, he had 
been paid and left, and that the officer took away the other man ; 
that he knew nothing more, that the night was very’ dark. 

Marius, ^ we have said, recollected nothing. He merely remem- 
bered having been seized from behind by a vigorous hand at the 
moment he fell backwards into the barricades, then all became a 
blank to him. He had recovered consciousness only at M. Gillenor- 
mand’s. 

He was lost in conjectures. 

He could not doubt his own identity. How did it come about, how- 
ever, that, falling in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had been picked 
up by the police officer on the banks of the Seine, near the Pont 
des Invalides? Somebody had carried him from the quartier of the 
markels to the Champs Elysees. And how? By the sewer. Un- 
paralleled devotion ! 

Somebody ? who ? . 

It was this man whom Marius sought. 

Of this man, who was his saviour, nothing; no trace; not the 
least indication. 

Marius, although compelled to great reserve in this respect, 
])ushed his researches as far as the prefecture of police. There, no 
more than elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any 
edaircissement. The prefecture knew less than the driver of the 
, fiacre. They had no knowledge of any arrest made on the 6th of 
June at tlie grating of the Grand Sewer; they had received no of- 
ficer’s report upon that fact, which, at the prefecture, was regarded 
as a faille. Hiey attributed the invention of this fable to the driver. 
A driver who wants drink-money is capable of an3rtliing, even of 
imagination. The thing was certain, for all that, and Marius could 
not doubt it, unless by doubting his own identity, as we have just 
said. 

Everything, in this strange enigma, was inexplicable. 

This man, this mysterious man, whom the driver had seen come

1142 L E S M I S E H A K I. E S 

It was Still imagined at that day, strange to tell, that a marriage 
is an intimate and social festival, that a patriarchal banquet does 
not spoil a domestic solemnity, that gaiety, even excessive, provided 
it be seemly, does no harm to happiness, and fm.ally tliat it is vener- 
able and good that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family 
is to arise, should commence in flie house, and that Ike household 
should have the nuptial chamber for a witness luaiceforth. 

And they have the shamelessness to he married at lunne. 

'J'he marriage took place, therefore, accordiiig to that now ob- 
solete fashion, at M. Gillenormand’s. 

Natural and ordinary as this matter of marriage may be, the 
■mnns to he published, the deeds to he drawn up, the mairie, the 
diurch, always render it somewhat comi»lex. 'i'hey could not be 
ready before the 16th of I'ehruary. 

Now, we mention this circumstanee for the pure satisfaction of 
being exact, it happened that the lf&gt;lh was .Mardi (Iras. Hesitations, 
scruples, particularly from Aunt (lillenoniuind. 

“Mardi Gras!" exclaimed tlie grandfather. “S(» much the better. 
There is a proverb : 

M.'irbme iiii Jfanli (iras, 

K'aiira point (renfanls iuRrats. 

I.et us go on. Here goes hir tlie I6th ! Ho you want to put it off, you, 
Marius 

“Certainly not !” aitswered the lover. 

“Let us grt married,’’ said the grand fatlter. 

So the marriage took place on tlie 16ih, notwithstamling the 
public gaiety. It rainwl that (lay, 1ml there is always a little patch 
of blue in the sky at the .service of happiness, which lovers see, even 
though the rest of cretition .be under an umbrella. 

On the previous evening, Jean X aljeati had handed to Marius, in 
presence of M. Gillenormand, the five hundred and eighty-four 
thousand francs. 

The marriage being performed under the ),iw of community, the 
deeds were simple. 

Toussaint was henceforth u.seless to Jean Vtiljean ; Cosette had 
inherited her and had promoted her to the rank of wailing-maid. 

As for Jean Valjean, there was a Iwautifu! room in the Gillenor- ‘ 
mand house furnished expres.sly {or him, and Cosette had said to 
him so irresi.stiblv : “Father, I pray you," that she had made him 
almost promise that he would come and occupy it. 

A few days before the day fixed for the marriage, an accident 
happened to J^n Valjean; ne slightly bruised the thumb of his 
right hand. It was not serious ; and he had allowed nobody to take 
any trouble about it, nor to dress it, nor even to see his hurt, not even 



JEANVALJEAN* 1145' 

Cosette, It compelled him^ however, to muffle his hand in a bandage, 
and to carry his arm in a sling, and prevented his signing anything. 
M. Gillenormand, as Cosette’s overseeing guardian, took his place. 

We shall take the reader neither to the mairie nor to the church. 
We hardly follow two lovers as far as that, and we generally turn 
our backs upon the drama as soon as it puts its bridegroom's bou- 
quet into his buttonhole. We shall merely mention an incident which, 
although unnoticed by the wedding party, marked its progress from 
the Rue des Filles du Calvaire to Saint Paul's. 

They were repaving, at that time, the northern extremity of the 
Rue Saint Louis. It was fenced off where it leaves the Rue du Parc 
Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to 
Saint Paul's. It was necessary to change the route, and the shortest 
way was to turn off by the boulevard. One of the guests observed that 
it was Mardi Gras, and that the boulevard would be encumbered 
with carriages. ‘Why?" asked M. Gillenormand. “On account of 
the masks." “Capital!" said the grandfather; “let us go that way. 
These young folks are marrying ; they are going to enter upon the 
serious things of life. It will prepare them fpr it to see a bit of 
masquerade." 

They went by the boulevard. The first of the wedding carriages 
contained Cosette and Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand, and 
Jean Vdjean. Marius, still separated from his betrothed, according 
to the custom, did not come till the second. The nuptial cortege, on 
leaving the Rue des Filles du Calvaire, was involved in the long 
procession of carriages which made an endless chain from the 
Madeleine to the Bastille and from the Bastille to the Madeleine. 

Masks abounded on the boulevard. It was of no avail that it 
rained at intervals; Pantaloon and Harlequin were obstinate. In 
the gdod-humour of that winter of 1833, Paris had disguised her- 
self as Venice. We see no such Mardi Gras nowadays. Eve^hing 
being an expanded carnival, there is no longer any carnival. 

The cross-alleys were choked with passengers, and tfie windows 
with the curious. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the 
theatres were lined with spectators. Besides the masks, they beheld 
that row, peculiar to Mardi Gras as well as to. Longchamps, of 
vehicles of all sorts, hackney coaches, spring carts, carrioles, cab- 
riolets; moving in order, rigorously riveted to one another by the 
regulations of the police, and, as it were, running in grooves. Who- 
ever is in one of these vehicles is, at the same time, spectator and 
spectacle. Sergents de ville kept those two interminable parallel 
files on the lower sides of the boulevard moving with a contrary mo- 
tioni and watched, so that nothing should hinder their double cur- 
rent, over those two streams of carriages flowing, the one down, 
the other up, the one towards the Chaussee d'Antin, the other 
towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine. The emblazoned carriages o£

JEAN VALJEAN 1149 

Cdsctte, at the mairie and in the church, was brilliant and touch- 
ing. I'onssaint, aided by Nicolette, had dressed her. 

Lr)sctte wore her dress of Binche guipure over a skirt of white 
taffetas, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a crown of 
orange flowers ; all this was white, and, in this whiteness, she was 
radiant. It was an exquisite candour, dilating and transfiguring 
itself iJito luminousness. One would have said she was a virgin in 
prt)cess of becoming a goddess. 

MariiiiiiS beautiful hair was perfumed and lustrous ; here and there 
might be discerned, under, the thickness of the locks, pallid lines, 
which were the scars of the barricade. 

'J'he grantifather, superb, his head held high, uniting more than 
ever in his toilet and manners all the elegances of the time of Barras, 
conducted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, as his 
arm was in a sling, could not give his hand to the bride, 
jean Valjean, in black, followed and smiled. 

“Monsieur b'auchelevent,” said the grandfather to him, “this is 
a liapi&gt;y day. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. There 
must no longcsr be any sadness anywhere henceforth. By Jove! I 
decree joy! Evil has no right to be. That there should be unfor- 
tunate men — in truth, it is a shame to the blue sky. Evil does not 
come from man, who, in reality, is good. All human miseries have 
fur their chief .seat and central government Hell,, otherwise called 
the Tuileries of the devil. Good, here am I saying demagogical 
words now! As for me, I no longer have any political opinions; 
that all men may be rich, that is to say, happy, that is all I ask for.” 

When, at the completion of all the ceremonies, after having pro- 
nnunceii l)efure the mayor and the priest every possible yes, after 
having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy, 
after having exchanged their rings, after having been on their 
knees elbow to elbow under the canopy of white moire in the smoke 
of the censer, hand in hand, admired and envied by all, Marius in 
black, she in white, preceded by the usher in colonel’s epaulettes, 
striking the pavement with his halberd, between two hedges of mar- 
velling spectators, they arrived under the portal of the church where 
tlte folding-doors were both open, ready to get^ into the carriage 
Hirain, and all was over, Cosette could not yet believe it* She looked 
at Marius, she looked at the throng, she looked at the sky ; it seemed 
as if she were afraid of awaking. Her astonished and bewildered 
air rendered her unspeakably bewitching. To return, they got into 
the same carriage, Marius by Cosette’s side; M. Gillenonnand 
and Jean Valjean sat opposite. Aunt Gillenormand had drawn back, 
one degree, and was in the seepnd carriage. My childr^, ^said 
the grandfather, “here you are Monsieur the Baron ^tid Madaipe 
the Baroness, with thirty thousand francs a year." And Cosette, 
close up to Marius, caressed his ear with this angelic

liacl been invited; they pressed eagerly about Cosette. They vied 
with each other in calling her Madame the Baroness. 

The officer Theodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come 
from Chartres, where he was now in garrison, to attend the wedding 
of his cousin Pontmercy. Cosette did not recognise him. 

He, for his part, accustomed to being thought handsome by the 
women, remembered Cosette no more than any other. 

“I was right in not believing that lancer’s story !” said Grand- 
father Gillenormand to himself. ■ 

Cosette had never been more tender towards Jean Valjean. She 
was in unison with Grandfather Gillenormand ; while he embodied 
joy in aphorisms and in maxims, she exhaled love and kindness like 
a perfume. Happiness wishes everybody happy. 

She went back, in speaking to Jean Valjean, to the tones of voice 
of the time when she was a little girl. She caressed him with smiles. 

A banciuct had been prepared in the dining-room. 

An illumination a giorno is the necessary attendant of a great 
joy. Dusk and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They do not 
consent to be dark. Night, yes ; darkness, no. If there is no sun, one 
must be made. 

'I'hc dining-room was a furnace of cheerful things. In the centre: 
above the white and glittering table, a Venetian lustre with flat 
drops, with all sorts of coloured birds, blue, violet, red,^green, 
perched in the midst of the candles ; about the lustre girandoles, 
upon the wall reflectors with triple and quintuple branches ; glasses, 
crystals, glassware, vessels, porcelains, Faenza-ware, pottery, gold 
arid .silver ware, all sparkled and rejoiced. The spaces between the 
candelabra were filled with bouquets, so that, wherever there was 
not a light, there was a flower. • 

In the antechamber three violins and a flute played some of 
Haydn’s quartettes in softened strains. _ 

Jean Valjean sat in a chair in the parlour, behind the door, which 
shut back upon him in such a way as almost to hide him. A few 
moments before they took their seats at the table, Cosette came,_ as 
if from a sudden impulse, and made him a low courtesy, spreading 
out her bridal dress with both hands, and, with a tenderly frolic- 
some look, she asked him : 

“Father, are you pleased?” 

“Yes,” said Jean Valjean, “I am pleased. 

"Well, then, laugh.” 

Jean Valjean began to laugh. 

A fsw tnoixicnts afterward, Basque announced dinner,^ 

The guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand giving his ara td 
Cosette, entered the dining-room, and took their places, accordmg tp 
the appointed order, about the table. 

Two large arm-chairs were placed, on the

L(io many green leaves, too much aurora in life? can you love each

iisteik% you are too pretty ! Take care, Nemorin, you are too hand- 
some. 1 lie rate absurdity ! Can you enchant each other too much, 
pel each Ollier too much, charm each other too much? can you be 
too much alive? can you he too happy? Moderate your joys Ah 
pshaw! I)i)wn with the philosophers! Wisdom is jubilation, Jubi- 
lale, juhilale. Arc we happy because we are good: or are we good 
because we are lia])i)y ? Is the Sancy called the Sancy because it be- 
lt iiiged to I larlay de Sancy, or because it weighs cent-six [a hundred 
and SIX I carats? 1 know nothing about it; life is full of such prob- 
lems: tlie impurlant thing b to have the Sancy, and happiness. Be 
happy willamt (piibliling. Obey the sun blindly. What is the sun? , 
It is liive. Who says love, says woman. Ah, ha ! There is an omnipo- 
tence; it is^ woman. Ask this demagogue of a Marius if he be not 
the slave of this little tyrant of a Cpsette, and with his full consent, 
tiu* ctiward. Woman! There is no Robespierre who holds out, 
woman reigns, I juii no longer a royalist except for that royalty. 
\\ liat is Adam ? Me is the realm of Eve. No ’89 for Eve. There was 
the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur de lys; there was the im- 
|&gt;erial sceptre surmounted by a globe; there was the sceptre of 
t liarlemagnt?, which was of iron; there was the .sceptre of Louis 
XIV., which was of gohl, the revolution twisted them between his 
thumb and finger like lialf-penny wisps of straw; they are finished, 
tlu'v are broken, tluy are on the ground, there is no longer a sceptre ; \ 
but gi*t me up some revolutions now against this little embroidered 
haiulkerchief which snH‘llH of patchouly! I would like to see you 
at It. Try. Why is it immovable? Because it is a rag. Ah! you are 
t!u‘ ninelVenth century ! Well, what then? We were the eighteenth I 
aiul we were ns stupid as you. Don’t imagine that you have changed 
any great thing in the universe because your stoop-galant is called 
t1ic‘ cholera morbus, and because your boree is called the cachucha. 
At heart you must always love women. I defy you to get away from 
that. These cleviles.ses are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss, 
that is a circle which I defy you to get out of ; and, as for myself, 
t woukl like very W(*n to get back into it. Which of you has seen 
rising into the infinite, calming all beneath her, gazing upon the 
waves like a woman, the star Venus, the great coquette of the abyss, 
Ifie CVlimeiic of the ocean? The ocean is a rude Alceste. Well, he 
scolds in vain; Venus appears, he is obliged to smile. That brute 
beast submits. We are all so. Wrath, tempest, thunderbolts, foam 
to the sky. A woman enters on the scene, a Star rises ; fiat on your 
face! Marius was fighting six months ago; he Si marrying to-day.

growing young again, 1 would like to go ami listen to the hagiti|«^s 
in the woods. These cltildreii who arc so fiirinuaU' as to he heauli- 
ful and happy, that fuddles me. I woidd gel married myself if any- 
body wished. It is imjiossihle to imagine that ImkI has made us fur 
anything but this: to idolise, to coo. lo plume, to !&gt;e pigeons, to !hj 
cocks, to bill with our loves from morning to night, to take pride 
in our little wives, to be vain, to lie irinmphani, to put on airs ; that 
is the aim of life. ITiat is, without otTence to you, what we thought, 
we oh! fellows, in our times when we were the yotmg f«»lks. Ah! 
odswinkers 1 wliat charming women there were in those days, and 
pretty faces, ami la.s.ses ! ‘There’s where I matle my ravages. Then 
love each other. If pcliple did not love one wtother, I really don’t 
see what use thei% would be in having any spring ; and, for my 
part, I should pray the good God to pack up ali the pretty things 
which he shows us. and trite than away from ua, and to put the 



j.eanvaljean 1155 

flowers, the birds, and the pretty girls, back into his box. My chil- 
dren, receive the benediction of the old goodman.” 

The evening was lively, gay, delightful. The sovereign good- 
liunioiii of ihe gTcind father gave the key-note to the whole festival, 
and everybody regulated himself by this almost centenarian cor- 
diality. 1 hey danced a little, they laughed much ; it was a good child- 
like wedding. They might have invited the goodman Formerly. In- 
deed, he was there in the person of Grandfather Gillenormand 

I here wa.s tumult, then silence. 

Ihe bride and groom disappeared. 

A litlle after midnight the Gillenormand house became a'temple. 

Here we stop. Upon the threshold of wedding-nights stands an 
angel smiling, his finger on his lip. 

^ 1 he .soul enters into contemplation before this sanctuary, in whidk 
i,s held the celebration of love. 

1 here mu.st be gleams of light above those houses. The joy whidh 
they contain must escajie in light through the stones of the walls, 
aiul sliine dimly into the darkness. It is impossible that this sacred 
fe.stival of destiny should not send a celestial radiation to the in- 
finite. Love is the sulilime crucible in which is consummated the 
fusion of man and woman ; the one being, the triple being, the final 
being, the human trinily_ springs from it. This birth of two souls 
into one must be an emotion for space. The lover is priest; the rapt 
maiden is affrighted. Something of this joy goes to God. Where 
there is really marriage, that is where there is love, the ideal is 
mingled with it. A nuptial bed makes a halo in the darkness. Were 
it given to the eye of flesh to perceive the fearful and enchanting 
sights of the superior life, it is probable that we should see the forms 
of night, the winged strangers, the blue travellers of the invisible, 
bending, a throng of shadowy heads, over the luminous house, 
pleased, lilessing, showing to one another the sweetly startled maiden 
bride, and wearing the reflection of the human felicity upon their 
divine countenances. If, at that supreme hour, the wedded pair, be- 
wiltlered with pleasure, and believing themselves alone, were to 
listen, they would hear in their chamber a rustling of confused 
■wings, I’erfect happines.s implies the solidarity of the angels. That 
little obscure alcove has for its ceiling the whole heavens. When two 
mouths, made sacred by love, draw near each other to create, it is 
imixissible that above that ineffable kiss there should not be a thrill 
in the immense mystery of the stars. 

The.sc are the true felicities. No joy beyond these joys. Love is 
the only ecstasy, everything else weeps. 

. To love or to have loved, that is enough. Ask nothing further. 
There is no other pearl to be found in the dark folds of life. To 
love is a consummation.

Jean Valjean looked at the walls, shut some closet doors, went and 
canu* from one room to the other. 

I'hen he found himself again in his own room, and he put his 
can&lt;IIe on the table. 

lie had^ released his arm from the sling, and he helped himself 
with his right hand as if he did not suffer from it. 

1 le approached his bed, and his eye fell, was it by chance? was 
it with intention? upon the inseparable, of which Cosette had been 
jealous, upon the little trunk which never left him. On the 4th of 
June, on arriving in the Rue de rHomme Arme, he had placed 
at upon a candle-stand at the head of his bed. He went to this stand 
with a sort of vivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the 
valis&lt;‘. ' ■ , 

lie took nut slowly the garments in which, ten years before, 
C*ost*ttc had left Montfermeil ; first the little dress, then the black 
scarf, tlum the great lieavy child's shoes which Cosette could have 
almi»st {mt on still, so small a foot she had, then the bodice of very 
thick fustian, tlien the knit-skirt, then the apron with pockets, then 
l!u‘ wtHtlleti stt»ckings. Those vStockings, on which the shape of a 
little leg was still gracefully marked, were hardly longer than Jean 
Valje.'m*s luamh These were all black. He had carried these gar- 
tneiils for her to Montfermeil. As he took them out of the valise, 
hv. laid tlu'in on the bed. He was thinking. He remembered. It was in 
winter, a very cold I.)eeemil)er, she shivered half-naked in rags, her 
poor lilth‘ feet all n‘d in her wooden shoes. He, Jean Valjean, he 
had taken lier away from those rags to clothe her in this mourning 
garli. The motlier must have been pleased in her tomb to see her 
dauglit&lt;*r wcjir mourning for her, mcl especially to see that she was 
clad, atnl lliat she was warm. He thoxight of that forest of Montfer- 
mcil ; they liad crossed it together, Cosette and he ; he thought of the 
wt*al!ier, of the trees without leaves, of the forest without birds, 
of the sky withotit sun ; it is all the same, it was charming. He ar- 
ranged tlu* little things upon the bed, the scarf next the skirt, the 
stockings heside the slices, the bodice beside the dress, and he looked 
at tliiiu oiii? after aimthcr. She was no higher than that, she had her 
great doll in her arms, slie had put her louis iVor in the pocket of 
this apron, site laughed, they walked holding each other by the hand 
she hml nobody hut him in the world. , , , , . i i 

Then his venerable white head fell upon the bed, this old stoicaA 
heart broke, his face was swallowed up, so to speak, in Cosette s 
garnienis, and anybody who had passed along the staircase at that 
moment, would have heard fearful sobs.

dicalnig linger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes upon 
the shadow.. 

Jean Valjean had, once again, the choice between the terrible 
haven and the smiling ambush. 

It is true, then? the soul may be cured, but not the lot. "Fearful 
thing! an incurable dCvStiny! 

I'he question which presented itself was this ; 

Jn what manner should Jean Valjean comport himself in regard 
to the lKipi)iness of Cosette and Marius? This happiness, it was he 
who had willed it, it was he who had made it ; he had thrust it into 
his own heart, and at this hour, looking upon it, he might have the 
same satisfaction that an armourer would have, who should recog- 
nise his own mark upon a blade, on withdrawing it all reeking from 
his breast. 

Cosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had every- 
thing, even riclies. And it was his work. 

Ihit this haiq)iness, now that it existed, now that it was here, 
what was he to do with it, he, Jean Valjean? Should he impose him- 
sel f u|)on this hai)piness ? Should he treat it as belonging to him ? Un- 
quest ionably, Cosette was another’s; but should he, Jean Valjean^ 
retain all of tV)sette that he could retain? Should he remain the kind 
of hatlier, scarcely seen, ])ut respected, which he had been hitherto? 
Should he introduce himself quietly into Cosette’s house ? Should he 
liring, without saying a word, his past to this future? Should he 
pn*seut‘ himself there as having a right, and should he come and 
take his seat, veiled, at that luminous hearth? Should he take, smil- 
ing upon them, the hands of those innocent beings into his two 
tragical liands? Should he place upon the peaceful andirons of the 
CilltMMJnnand parlour, his feet which dragged after them the in- 
(txtmm shadow of tlie law? Should he enter upon a participation 
of chancils with Cosette and Marius? Should he thicken the ob- 
s&lt;mrity upon his head and the cloud upon theirs? Should he put itt 
Ins catastrophe as a companion for their two felicities? Should he 
continue to keep silence? In a word, should he be, by the side of 
these Iwti happy beings, the ominous mute of destiny? 

\\\‘ must Ih‘ accustomed to fatality and its encounter, to dare to 
raise mtr eyt‘s when certain questions appear to us in their horrible 
nakedness, (mod or evil are behind this severe interrogation point 
••W'hat are yc,u going to do?” demands the sphynx. ^ _ 

'rids faniiliarily with trial Jean Valjean had. He looked fixedly 


npon the sphynx, « i. 

Me examined the pitiless problem tinder all its ph^es. 

Cosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. 
What was he to do ? Cling on, or let go his hold ? 

If he clung to it, he escaped disaster, he rose again into the sun-

sceptre of red-hot iron, but you have yet to put on the mantle of 
flame, and is tliere no moment when the wretched flesh revolts, and 
when you abdicate the torture ? 

At last Jean Valjean entered the calmness of despair. 

lie weighed, he thought, he considered the alternatives of the 
mysterious balance of light and shade. 

To impose his galleys upon these two dazzling children, or to 
consummate by himself his irremediable engulfnient. On the one 
side the sacrifice of Cosette, on the other of himself. 

At what solution did he stop? 

What determination did he take? What was, within himself, hin 
final answer to the incorruptible demand of fatality? What door 
did he decide to open ? Which side of his life did he resolve to close 
and to condemn ? Between all these unfathomable precipices which 
surrounded him, what was his choice? What extremity did he ac- 
cept ? To which of these gulfs did he bow his head ? 

His giddy reverie lasted all night. 

He remained there until dawn, in the same attitude, doubled over 
on the bed, prostrated under the enormity of fate, crushed perhaps, 
alas ! his fiste clenched, his arms extended at a right angle, like one 
taken from the cross and thrown down with his face to the ground. 
He remained twelve hours, the twelve hours of a long winter night, 
diilled, without lifting his head, and without uttering a word. He 
was as moti(mlcss as a corpse, while his thought writhed upon the 
gn jund and flew away, now like the hydra, now like the eagle. To see 
him thus without motion, one would have said he was dead ; suddenly 
he thrilled convulsively, and his mouth, fixed upon Cosette's gar- 
ments, kiss(Kl them ; then one saw that he was alive. 

What one? since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was nobody 
there ? 

'fhe One who is in the darkness.

“No, Do not tell him that it is 1. Tell him that someliody asks to

“Ah 1“ said Basque. 

“I wish to give him a surprise."

you undersl.and, fit! Iter? I ’01110 now, you hrcaUfasi with in- to-day?" 

'‘Monsieur," .stiiil Jean \‘uljean. "I have one thing to tell yoii. 1 
am an old convict." 

The limit of perceptible acute souiuls may he pimscd ipiife as ea.sily 
for the mind as for tlie ear. Those words : / $tiit tin old l onrii t, com- 
ing fronvM. Fauchelcvent’s imtiuli and enieiing .Marins’ ear, went 
beyond the possible. Marius did not hear. It smueil l«i him that 
something had just Iteen .said to him: Init he knew not what. He 
stood aghast. 

He then perceived that flte man who was talking to him was ter- 
tible. Excifeii as he was, he li-id not until this moment noticeil that 
frightful iKillor. 

Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which sust.ainefi his right 
arm, took of? the cloth wound ahunt his he.id, l.'iid his thumb bjirc, 
and showed it to Marius. 

"There is nothing the matter witli my hand," said he. 

Marius looked at the thumb. 

"There has never been anything the matter with it," omtinued 
jean Valjean. 

There was, in fact, no trace of a wound. 

Jean Valjean pursued ; 

"It waa beat that I should be absent from your marriage. I absented 
layseif as jmteh as I oould. I f e%ned dtia imtmd so as not to commit 



JEANVALJEAN 1165 

a forgery, not to introduce a nullity into the marriage acts, to 
excused from signing/’ 

Marius stammered out : 

'‘What does this mean ?” 

"It means,” answered Jean Valjean, "that I have been in the gal- 
leys.” 

"You drive me mad!” exclaimed Marius in dismay. 

"Monsieur Pontmercy,” said Jean Valjean, "I was nineteen years 
in the galleys. For robbery. Then I was sentenced for life. For rob- 
bery. b'or a second offence. At this hour I am in breach of ban.” 

It was xtseless for Marius to recoil before the reality, to refuse 
the fact, to resist the evidence ; he was compelled to yield. He began 
to comprehend, and as always happens in such a case, he conipre- 
heinlcd l)eyond the truth. He felt the shiver of a horrible inteidor 
flash ; an idea which made him shudder, crossed his mind. He caught 
a glimpse in the future of a hideous destiny for himself. 

"Tell all, tell all 1” cried he. "You are Cosette’s father 1” 

And he took two steps backward with an expression of unspeak- 
able horror, 

Jean Valjean raised his head with such a majesty of attitude that 
he seemed to rise to the ceiling. 

"It is necessary that you believe me in this, monsieur; although 
the oath of such as I be not received.” 

Mere he made a pause ; then, with a sort of sovereign and sepul- 
cliral autliority, he added, articulating slowly and emphasising his 
syllaldes : 

" You will l)elieve me. I, the father of Cosette! before God, 

no, Mo!tsicur Baron I\:)ntmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I 
earnetl my living by priming trees. My name is not Fauchelevent, 
my name is Jean Valjean. I am nothing to Cosette. Compose your- 
self.** 

Marius faltered: 

"Who proves it to me •” 

"I, Since I say so,” 

Marius looked at this man. He was mournful, yet self-possessed. 
No He could come out of such a calmness. That which is frozen is 
sincere. We fed the truth in that sepulchral coldness. 

*M believe yojm** said Marius, 

Jean Valjean inclined his head as if making oath, and continued : 

" Wliat am I to Cosette ? a passer. Ten years ago, I did not know 
that she existed, I love her, it is true. A child whom one has seen 
when little, being himself already old, he loves. When a man is old, 
he feels like a grandfather towards all little children. You can, it 
seems to me, suppose that I have something which resembles a 
heart. She was an orphan. Without father or mother. She had need 
of me* Tha^ is why 1 began to love her. Children are so weak, tha'

all live together, eat in common, I will give my arm to Cosette-^to 
Madame Pontmercy, pardon me, it is from habit — we will have but 
one roof, but one table, but one fire, the same chimney corner in win-^ 
ter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness, 
that, it is everything. We will live as one family, one family!'' 

At this word Jean Valjean grew wild. He folded his arms, gazed 
at the floor at his feet as if he wished to hollow out an abyss in it, 
and his voice suddenly became piercing. 

family I no. I am of no family. I am not of yours. I am not 
of the family of men. In houses where people are at home I am an 
incunibrancc. There are families, but they are not for me. I am the 
unfortunate; 1 am outside. Had I a father and a mother? I almost 
doubt it. 1 he day that I married that child it was all over, I saw that 
she was hajijiy, and that she was with the man whom she loved j, and 
that there was a good old man here, a household of two angels, all 
joys hi this house, and that it was well, I said to myself : Enter thou 
not. 1 could have lied, it is true, have deceived you all, have remained 
M onsieur ,I&lt;\auchele.vent. As long as it was for her, I could lie ; but 
mm it would be for myself, I must not do it. It was enough to re- 
main silent, it is true, and everything would continue. You ask me 
wIkU forces me to wSi)cak ? a strange thing ; my conscience. To remain 
‘client was, however, very easy, 1 have passed the night in trying to 
persuade myself to do so ; you are confessing me, and what I come 
to tell you is so strange that you have a right to do so ; well, yes, I 
have passed tlie niglit in giving myself reasons, I have given myself 
very goixl reasons, I have done what I could, it was of no use. But 
there are t wo thing's in which I did not succeed ; neither in breaking 
the cord which liolds me by the heart fixed, riveted, and sealed here, 
nor in silencing some one who speaks low to me when I am alone. 
Tiiat is why 1 have come to confess all to you this morning. All, or 
alnicxst all. It is useless to tell what concerns only myself ; I keep 
it for my self. The essential you know. So I have taken my mystery, 
and bnnight it to you. And I have ripped open my secret under your 
eyes. It was not an easy resolution to form. All night I have strug- 
gled with myself. Ah! you think I have not said to myself that this 
is not the Champmathieu affair, that in concealing my name I do 
no harm to anybody, that the name of Fauchelevent was given to 
me by Fauchelevent himself in gratitude for a service rendered, and 
1 could very well keep it, and that I should be happy in this room 
which you offer me, that I should interfere with nothing, that I 
should be in my little corner, and that, while you would have Cos- 
ette, I should nave the idea of being in the same house with her* 
Each one would have had his due share of happiness. To continue 
to be Monsieur Fauchelevent, smoothed the way for everything. 
Yes, except for my soul. There was joy everywhere about me, the 
depths of my soul were still black. It is not enough to be happy, we 



1 ir»8 I- K S M I S K R A B 1. J': S 

must be satisfied with ourselves. 'I hus I should have remained 
Monsieur FuucheleveiU, thtis 1 should have eonecaitsi iny real face, 
thus, in presence of your eheerl’nlness, I shoulii have l«irne an

they had known, wouhl have stiid: Ilow horiilile! 1 should have

are alive. Her i should h.ivc coudium&lt;d to iiiysetf for ever, \‘ou, 
Cosette, and I, we should have heen three heads in the green cap! 
Do you not shudder' I am only the most depresstd of men, 1 should

mitted every day! this lie 1 should have aci.-d every day! And 
this face of night i should liave worn evo v day ! And of my dis- 
grace, I should have given to you your part every day ! every diivl 
to you, my loved ones, you, my chddreu. you, my imutceuis! To lie 

f iwt is nothing? to keep silence is simple ? .Vo. it is not simple,

unworthincss, and my cowardice, and my treachery, .'iihI my crime,

face, and I should have answered the smile of the angel with the 
smile of the dunned, and I should have l&gt;ern a cletcstabic im|x&gt;8tur! 
What for? to be happy. To be happy, I ! Have I the right to be 
happy? I am outside of life, raonsieur." 

Jean Valjean stopped. Marius listened. Such a ctmln of Ideas and 
of pangs cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice 
mew. but it was no longer a hollow voice, it was un ominous voice. 

“You ask why I speak ? i am neither informed agidnst, nor jpur- 
«t«d, tmr hunted, say you. Yes 1 1 am hiformed agunst i yes 1 1 un 
pursued lyes ! I am hinted? By whom ?by i^rmlf. it is I myself who

JEAN VALJEAN 1169’ 

and I check myself, and I exert myself, and when one holds himself 
he is well held." 

And .seizing his own coat in his clenched hand and drawing it to- , 
wards Marius : • 

“Look at this hand, now,” continued he. “Don’t you think that it 
holds this collar in such a way as not to let go? Well! conscience 
has quite another grasp 1 If we wish to be happy, monsieur, we must 
never comin'ehend duty; for, as soon as we comprehend it; it is 
implacable. One would say that it punishes you for comprehending- 
it ; but no, it rewards you for it ; for it puts you into a hell where 
you feel God at your side. Your heart is not so soon lacerated when 
you arc at peace with yourself.” 

And, with a bitter emphasis, he added ; 

“ATon.sicur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, but I am an 
honest man. It is by degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate 
mysdf in my own. This has already happened to me once, but it 
wa.s Ics.s grevious then ; it was nothing. Yes, an honest man. I should 
not be one if you had, by my fault, continued to esteem me; now 
that you despise me, I am one. I have this fatality upon me that, be- 
ing forever unalile to have any but stolen consideration, that con- 
.sideration humiliates me and depresses me inwardly, and in order 
•that I may respect myself, I must be despised. Then I hold myself 
erect. I nm a galley slave who obeys his conscience. I know well that 
is im]&gt;rulKibk!. But what would you have me do? it is so. I have as- 
sumed engagements towards myself ; I keep them. There are acci- 
dents which liind us, there are chances which drag us into duties. 
You see, Monsieur Pontmercy, some things liave happened to me 


in my life?” . 

Jean Valjean paused again, swallowing his saliva with effort, as 
if hi.s word.s had a bitter after-taste, and resumed: 

“When one has such a horror over him, he has no right to raatee 
otlicrs .share it without their knowledge, he lias no right to communi- 
cate his pestilence to them, he has no right to make them ^hp down 
his nreciiiiee without warning of it, he has no right to let his red 
cap he tlrawn upon them, he has no right craftily to encumber the 
happiness of others with his own misery lo approach those who 
arc well, apd to touch them in the shadow with his invisible ulcer, that 
is horrilih*. haududevent lent me his namejn vam. I tod no right to

I come to tell you all this. In mere wanlotiness, as you say.” 

Mehreathed with difflculiy, and forcctl out tlu.'se t'nial "worils: 

“'I'o live, once i .stole a loaf of hre:Ml ; to-«l;iy, to live, I will not

"To live !” interrupted Marins. “You have no neeil of that name to

“Ah! I understand,” an.swereil Jean \’aljeaii, raising ami ittwer- 
ing hi.s head .sevend times in succession, 

'i'here was a pan.se. llotii were silent, each sunk in an ahyss of 
thought. Marius huti seated liimself hesitle a taltle, am! was rest-

Wtus walking hack and forth, l ie .sloppeil hefore a gl.tss am! sttHKl

looking at that glass in which he diti mil see liiiiisclf ; 

“While at present, 1 am relieved !” 

Me resumed his walk and went to the oilier end ttf the parlour. 
Just as he hegan to turn, he pereeived that .Marius was noticing liLs

“1 drag one leg a little. You umleisiumi why now.” 

Then lie turned ijuite. round towards Mariiis; 

“And now, monsieur, picture this pi yoiirsel i : I have said uolhiiig, 
I have remained Monsieur I'auclteleveiit, 1 liave taken my place in 
your house, I am one of you, 1 am in my room, I come to lireakfast 
in the morning in slippers, at night we” all three go to tlie tlieatre, 
I accompany Madame Pontniercy to the Tnilerii-s ami to the Place 
Royale, we are together, yms .supjiose me your ct|iial : some itne day 
I am there, you are there, we are chatting, we are laughing, smlilenly 
you hear a voice .shout this name: Jean Valjean! am! you see tliat 
appalling hand, the jailice, spring out of l!ic shadow and nhrnptly 
tear off my mask !” 

Hi (»a8ed again ; Marius hat! risen with a shutlUer. Jean Valjean 
resumed: 

“What say you ?” 

Marius’ silence answered. 

Jean Valjean continued : 

“You see very well that I am right in not kewiing quiet. Go on, 
W happy, be in heaven, be an angel of an angel, lie in tW sunshine, 
and be contented with it, and do not trouble yourself about the way 
which a poor condemned man takes to open his heart and do hit 
duty ; you have a wretched man before you, monsieur." 

Marius crossed the parlour slowly, an4 when he was near Jean 
Vt^lieui. extended bun hk hai»i 



JEAN VALJEANT 1171 

But Marius had to take that hand which did not offer itself, Jean 
Valjean was passive, and it seemed to Marius that he was grasping 
a hand of marble. 

'‘My grandfather has friends,” said Marius. "I will pi-ocure your 
pardon.” 

“It is useless,” answered Jean Valjean. “They think me dead, 
that is enough. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They 
are supi)Osed to moulder tranquilly. Death is the same thing as par- 
don,” 

And, disengaging his hand, which Marius held, he added with 
a sort of inexorable dignity : 

“Besides, to do my duty, that is the friend to which I have re- 
course ; and I need pardon of but one, that is my conscience.” 

Just then, at the other end of the parlour, the door was softly 
opened a little way, and Cosette^s head made its appearance. They 
saw only her sweet f&lt;ice, her hair was in charming disorder, her eye- 
lids were still swollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird 
passing its head out of its nest, looked first at her husband, then at 
Jean Valjean, and called to them with a laugh, you would have 
thought yott saw a smile at the bottom of a rose : 

“ni wager that youh^e talking politics. How stupid that is, instead 
of being with me !” 

Jean Valjean shuddered, 

“Cosette,” faltered Marius — ^and he stopped. One would have 
said that they were two culprits, 

Cosette, radiant, continued to look at them both. The frolic of 
para&lt;lise was in lier eyes. 

“I catch you in the very act,” said Cosette. “I just heard my 
fatlier h'auchelevent say, through the door: ‘Conscience — Do his 
duly/ — It is politics, that is. I will not have it You ought not to 
talk politics the very next day. It is not right.” 

are mistaken, Cosette,” answered Marius. “We were talk- 
ing business. We are talking of the best investment for your six 
hundred thtmsand francs— ” 

“It is not all that,” interrupted Cosette. “I am coming. Do you 
want me here 

And, passing resolutely through the door, she came into the par- 
lour. She was dressed in a full white morning gown, with a thousand 
folds and with wide sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to 
her feet. There are in the golden skies of old Gothic pictures such 
charming robes for angels to wear. 

She viewed herself from head to foot m a large glass,* then ex- 
claimed with an explosion of ineffable ecstasy: 

“Once there was a king and a queen. Oh! how ha^y I ami 

So saying, she made a reverence to Marius and to Jean Valjean. 

“There,” said she, “I am going to install myself by you in an arm-

“No.” 

“Arc you sad ?” 

“No.” 

“Kiss me. If you are well, if you sleep well, if you are happy, I 
will not scold you.” 

And again she offered him her forehead. 

jean Valjcan kissed that forehead, upon which there was a celes- 
tial reflection. 

“Smile.” _ 

Jean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre. 

“Now defend me against my husband.” 

“Cosette! — ” said Marius. 

“(let angry, father. Tell him that I must stay. You can surely 
talk before me. So you think me very silly. It is veiy astonishing 
then what you are saying ! business, putting money in a hank, that 
is a great affair. Men play the mysterious for nothing. I want to stay. 

I am very pretty this morning. I^ok at me, Marius.” _ 

Ami w’ith ati adorable shrug of the shoulders and an inexpressibly 
es(iuisite pout, she looked at Marius. It was like a flash between 
these two beings, 'rhat somebody was there mattered little. 

“1 love you !” .said Marius. ■ 

“I adore }'ou !” said Cosette. 

And they fell irresistibly into each other’s arms. 

“Now," resumed Cosette, readjusting a fold of her gown with a 
little triumphant pout, “I shall stay.” 

“Wliat, no,” answered Marius, in a tone of entreaty, ‘we have 
.something to finish.” 

“No, .St ill?” 

Mtu’ius assumed a grave tone of voice: 

“ I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible.” 

“Ah ! ysni put on your man’s voice, monsieur. Very well, 1 11 go. 
You, father, you have not sustained me. Monsieur my husband, 
rnmtsieur my papa, you are tyrants. I am going to tell grandfather 
«)f you. If you think tluit I shall come back and talk nonsense to you, 
you tire mfstnken. I am proud. I wait for you now, you will see that 
It is you who will get tired without me. I am going away, very well., 

And she went out. r i r 

'I'wo seconds later, the door opened again, her fresh ros 3 [ race 
p.issed once more between the two folding doors, and she cried to 
them : 

“1 am very angry." . , , j 

The door closed again and the darkn^s returned. _ 

It was like a stray sunbeam^ which, without suspecting it, should 
have suddenly traversed the night. „ , , 

Marius made sure that the door was we 1 closed.

JEANVALJEAN 1175 

He placed his hand upon the knob, the latch yielded, the door 
started, Jean \'aljean opened it wide enough to enable him to pass 
out, stopped a second motionless, then shut the door, and turned 
towards Marius. 

He was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer tears 
in his eyes, but a sort of tragical flame. His voice had again become 
strangely calm. 

“But, monsieur,'' said he, “if you are willing, I will come and 
sec her. I assure you that I desire it very much. If I had not clung 
to seeing Cosette, I should not have made the avowal which I have 
made, 1 should have gone away; but. wishing to stay in the place 
where Cosette is and to continue to see her, I was compelled in honour 
to tell yon all. You follow my reasoning, do you not? that 
is a thing which extdains itself. You see, for nine years past, I have, 
had her near me. We lived first in that ruin on the boulevard, then 
in the convent, then near the Luxembourg. It was there that you saw 
her for the first time. You remember her blue plush hat. We were 
afterwards in the quartier of the Invalides where there was a grat- 
itig and a garden. Rue Plumet. I lived in a little back-yard where I 
lieard her piano. That was my life. We never left each other. That 
lasted nine years and some months. I was like her father, and^she 
was iny child. I don't know whether you understand me, Monsieur 
I^jntinercy, hut from the present time, to see her no more, to speak 
to her no more, to have nothing more, that would be hard. If you 
do not tliink it wrong, I will come from time to time to see Cosette. 

I shtuild not come often. I would not stay long. You might say I 
should be received in the little low room. On the ground floor. I 
would willingly come in by the baclcTdoor, which is for the servants, 
Init that would excite wt&gt;ndcr, perhaps. It is better, I suppose, that 
I should tjnter bv the usual door. Monsieur, indeed, I would really 
like to sec&gt; Cosette a little still As rarely as you please. Put yourself 
in my place, it is all that I have. And then, we must take care. If I 
slundd not come at all, it would have a bad effect, it would be thought 
singular. For instance, what, I can do, is to come in the evening, at » 

niglulill'' ^ 1 

will come every evening,*' said Blarius, and Cosette will 

expect, you." ' 

are kind, monsieur," said Jean Valjean. 

Marins Ik wed to Jean Valjean, happiness conducted despair to 
the door, andthese two men separated. 


the obscurities which a revelation may contain 
Marius was completely unhinged.

viatness without being accuser. Besides, those few weeks had beeii 
])ut a flash ; they had had time for nothing, except to loye. Finally, 
everything being weighed, turned over, and examined, if he had told 
the story of the Gorbeau ambuscade to Cosette, if he had named the 
1 licnardiers to her, what would have been the consequences, if he 
had even discovered Jean Valjean was a convict, would that have 
changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, Cosette? 
Would he have shrunk back ? Would he have adored her less ? Would 
he the less have married her? No. Would it have changed anything 
in what had taken place? No. Nothing then to regret, nothing to 
reproach himself with. All was well. There is a God for these drunk- 
ards who are called lovers. Blind, Marius had followed the route 
which he would have chosen had he seen clearly. Love had bandaged 
his eyes, to lead him where? To Paradise. 

But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal 
accompaniment. 

The feu'mer repulsion of Marius towards this man, towards this 
Fauchelevcnt become Jean Valjean, was now mingled with horror. 

In this horror, we must say, there was some pity, and also a cer-* 
tain astonishifient. 

Tliis robber, this twice-convicted robber, had restored a trust/ 
And what a trust ? Six hundred thousand francs. He was alone in the 
secret of the trust. He might have kept all, he had given up all. 

Moreover, he had revealed his condition of his own accord. Noth- 
ing obliged him to do so. If it were known who he was, it was through 
himself. There was more in that avowal than the acceptance of hu- 
miliation, there was the acceptance of peril. To a condemned maiij 
a mask is not a mask, but a vShelter. He had renounced that shelter. 
A false name is security ; he had thrown away this false name. He 
could, he, a galley-slave, have hidden himself for ever in an hon- 
ouralile family ; he had resisted this temptation. And from' what mo- 
tive ? from conscientious scruples. He had explained it himself with 
the irresistible accent of reality. In short, whatever this Jean Val 
jean might be, he had incontestably an awakened conscience. There 
was in him some mysterious regeneration begun ; and, according to 
all appearance, for a long time already the scruple had been master 
of the man. Such paroxysms of justice and goodness do not belong 
to vulgar natures. An awakening of conscience is greatness of soul. 

Jean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable, un- 
* questionable, evident even by the grief which it caused him, rendered 
investigation tiseless and gave authority to all that this man said. 
Here, for Marius, a strange inversion of situations. What came 
from M. Fauchelevcnt? distrust. What flowed from Jean Valjean? 
confidence. 

In the mysterious account which Marius thoughtfully drew up 
concerning this Jean Valjean, he verified the credit, he verified the

pnrsiiiiig, so to speak, Je:ui Valjt-an in the depths of his thoiiglu,

The trust honestly surrendered, the prohily of the avowal, that 
was gootl. It was like a break in tlie cloud, lint the cloud again he- 
rame Idack, 

Confused as Marius' recollections witc, soiite shadow of them 
returned to him. 

What was the exact nature of tliat .•ilTair in tin? jtiinlrette garret? 
\yhy, on the arrivtil of tlie police, did litis man, instead of making 
his compkiint, make his eseajK*? Mere Marins found the answer. 
Because this man was a fugitive from jtistiee in hre.ieh of han. 

Another question : ^\'hy Imd lliis man come into the h;irric;i«ie? 
For now Marius saw that remijiiseeiice again fiisiiiuily, reappearing 
in these emolhms like sympulhetie ink hefore the tire. This man was 
in the harricade. He did not figlit there. What did he come there 
for? Before this (inestion a s|H’eire arose, and made response, javert, 
. Marius reetilleel perfectly to mind at this hour the fata! siglit of Jean 
Valjean dragging Javert himiid outside the harricade,* and he a’g.iin 
heard the frightful pisud-shot heliiiid the corner of the liiile kite 
Mondetour. There was, prohahly, hatred between the spy and this 
galley-slave. 'I'he one eramjied the other. Jimii \ aljean had gone to 
the barricaile to avenge himself. He hail arrived late. He knew 
proliahly that Javert was a prisoner there. ‘I’he i Virsican vemleiia

please God to tiiir the angel with the demon ? Can then a crime and 
an innocent be room&gt;matea in the mysterious galleys &lt;if misery ? 
In this strait of the condemned, which is called human destitiy, can 
two foreheads pa-ss close to one another, the one childlike, the other 
terrible, the one all hathetl in the divine whiteness of the dawn, the 
other for ever pallid with the glare of an eternal lightning? Who

prehensible, attach the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved the 
lamb, for the savage being adored the frail being, for, during nine 
years, the angel had had the monster for a support. Cosette's child- 
hood and youth, her coming to the day, her maidenly growth towards 
life and light, had been protected by this monstrous devotion. Here, 
the questions exfoliated, so to speak, into innumerable enigmas, 
abyss opened at the bottom of abysm, and Marius could no longer 
bend over Jean Valjean without dizziness. What then was this man 
precipice ? 

The old Genesiac symbols are eternal ; in human society, such as 
it is and will be, until the day when a greater light shall change it, 
there are always two men, one superior, the other subterranean; he 
who follows good is Abel ; he who follows evil is Cain. What was 
this remorseful Cain? What was this bandit religiously absorbed 
in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, bringing her up, 
guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, himself impure, 
with purity? What was this cloaca which had venerated this inno- 
cence to such an extent as to leave it immaculate ? What was this 
Jean Valjean watching over the education of Cosette? What was 
this figure of clai^kness, whose only care was to preserve from all 
shadow and from all cloud the rising of a star ? 

In this was the secret of Jean Valjean ; in this was also the secret 
of God* 

Before this doulde secret, Marius recoiled. The one in some sort 
reassured him in regard to the other. God was as visible in this as 
Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He uses what tool He 
ideases. He is not responsil:)le to man. Do we know the ways of God ? 
Jean Valjean had laboured upon Cosette. He had, to some extent,, 
formed that soul. That was incontestable. Well, what then? The 
workman was horrible ; but the work admirable. God performs His 
miracles as seems good to Himself. He had constructed this enchant- 
ing Cosette, and he had employed Jean Valjean on the work. It had 
pleased Him to choose this strange co-worker. What reckoning have 
we to ask of Him ? Is it the first time that the dunghill has aided the 
spring to make the rose ? 

Marius made these answers to himself, and declared that they 
were good. On all the points which we have just indicated, he had 
not dared to press Jean Valjean, without avowing to himself that 
he dared not. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette. Cosette was 
resplendently pure. That was enough for him. What explanation did 
he need ? Cosette was a light. Does light need to be explained ? He 
had all ; what could he desire ? AH, is not that enough. The personal 
affairs of Jean Valjean did not concern him. In bending over the 
fatal shade of this man, he clung to this solemn declaration of the 
miserable being : am nothing to Cosette. Ten years ago^ I did 
know of her existence f .

Jean Valjcan was a passer, 1 le had said su. himself. WVll, he was 
passiiijf away. Whatever lie inijLiht lx-, Ids |)ar) was liiiislied. lieiice- 
forth Marius was to perform the fimelioiis of I'mvideiiee for Co- 
sefte. t 'osette had eoino forili to tiud in tiu! a.-mre lier mate, her 
lover, her imshaii&lt;l, her celestial male. In l.nk-ino Sliyht, fosetie, 
wiii,! 4 'ed and tratisliynred, left hehiiid her on the .tjrouiid, empty and 
hideous, her elirysalis, Jean \'a!j&lt;‘an. 

Ill wliatever eircli; of ideas .Marius turned, he .always came hack 
from it to a certain horror of Jean X'aljean. A s.u'ied horror, per- 
haps, for, as we hav&lt;‘ just indiealed, he felt a t/ir.i/ iliriiuiiii in this 
man. Ihtt, whatever he did, and whatever iidtiyalion he soitidn, he 
was always ohligiul to f;dl haek u|Htn tliis; he was ;t eonviei ; iliai is, 
the creature wlui, mi the soei.al ladder, has no plaee, iieiitij Itelow tiie

vict is no ImiKer, so to speak, llu* f&lt;-llow of the liviit;*. I'he law' has 
deprived him of all the hiiinaniiy wdiieh it eaii lake from a mtni. 
Msirins, upon penal questions, aliiioiiji;h a (b inoeral, still atlliered to 
the iiiexorahle system, and he had, in ref^anl to those whom ilie law 
.smites, all the ideas of tlie law. He had not yet, let ns sav, .'ulopted 
ail the ideas of pro)&gt;ress. lie hail not yet come to di&gt;lini;tiish he- 
iweeii what is wrilicn iiy man and what is wriiten hy &lt; iod. heiween 
law and ri^tiit. He liatl not esaminetl and weiidird the rif&gt;lit which 
man assumes to dispose of tlie irrevocahle ;mil the irreparahle. lie 
had not revolted from the word fi/i/A'init c, ife ihoiiKht it natural 
that certain infraclioiis of tlie wi iileii law slioiihl he followed hy 
eternal penalties, and he acee|ite»l social damnation as |;;rowiii|' 
out of civiliaatinn. He was still at that point, inf.dlililv to aclvanee 
■in time, his nature being good, ami in reality entirely coiiijmsed of 
latent progress. 

_ Through the medium of these ideas. Jean V,-tljean appeared to 
him deformed and ri'intlsive. He was the mitc.ist. He was the eon- 
vict. This word was for him like a sound of the last trumpet : ami, 
after ha vinff considen-d Jean Valjean long, his Ittial action was to 
turn away his head. Fmlf relro, 

Marius, we must remcmlter, am! even insist upon it. though he lind 
&lt;ftieitioned Jean Valjam to such an cxteiii, that Jean Valjean hatl 
tNuid to hfen; Yen or* conftssmg me; ha«l not, however, pm to him 
two or three decisive questions. Not that they ha&lt;l not presented 
themselves to his mind, but he was afraid of them. The Jondrette 
garret? The barricade? Javert? Who knows where the revelations 
would have stopped ? Jean Valj«in did not seem the mdn to .shrink, 
and who knows whether Marius, after having urged him on, would 
not have desired to restrain him? In certain st^Mome conjunctures, 
has It not happened to all of us, after Imving ptit t questhm, to stop

ardice ei^ially when we love. It is not prudent to questimi un^

toward vsituations to the last degree, especially when, the indis- 
soluble portion of our own life is fatally interwoven with them. 
From Jean Val jean’s despairing explanations, some appalling light 
might have sprung, and who knows but that hideous brilliancy 
might have been thrown even upon Cosette? Who knows but a 
sort of infernal glare would have remained upon the brow of this 
angel ? The spatterings of a flash are still hghtning. Fatality has 
such solidarities, whereby innocence itself is impressed with crime 
by the gloomy law of colouring reflections. The purest faces may 
preserve for ever the reverberations of a horrible surrounding. 
Wrongly or rightly Marius had been afraid. He knew too much 
already. He sought rather to blind than to enlighten himself. In des- 
peration, he carried off Cosette in his ai'ms, closing his eyes upon 
Jean Valjean. 

Thk man was of the night, of the living and terrible night. How 
should he dare to probe it to the bottom ? It is appalling to question 
the shadow. Who knows what answer it will make ? The dawn might 
be blackened by it for ever. 

In this frame of mind it was a bitter perplexity to Marius to 
think that this man should have hei*ceforth any contact whatever 
with Cosette. These fearful questions, before which he had shrunk, 
and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have 
sprung, he now reproached himself almost, for not having put. He 
thought himself too good, too mild, let us say the word, too weak. 
This weakness had led him to an impi'udent concession. He had 
allowed himself to be moved. He had done wrong. He should have 
merely and simply cast off Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean was the 
Jonah, he should have done it, and relieved his house of this man. 
He was vexed with himself ; he was vexed with the abruptness of 
that whirl of emotions which had deafened, blinded, and drawn him 
on. He was displeased with himself. 

What should be done now? Jean Valjean’s visits were -very re- 
pugnant to him. Of what use was this man in his house? What 
should he do? Here he shook off his thoughts ; he was unwilling to 
probe, he was unwilling to go deeper; he was unwilling to fathom 
himself. Ho had promised, he had allowed himself to be led into a 
promise ; Jean Valjean had his promise ; even to a convict, especially 
to a convict, a man should keep his word. Still, his first duty was 
towards Cosette. In short, a repulsion, which predominated over all 
else, possessed him. , . 

Marius turned all this assemblage of ideas oyer m his mmd con- 
fusedly, passing from one to another, and excited by all. Hence a 
deep commotion. It was not easy for him to hide this commotion 
from Cosette, but love is a talent, and Marius succeeded. _ 

Besides, he put without apparent object, some questions to Cos- 
ette, who, as candid as a dove is white, suspected nothing ; he talked

TMK llASEMENT ROOM 

Tiik next day, at: ni/^lufall, Jean \%aljean knocked at the M. Gille- 
n&lt;»nnaiul ]un*tt'~cochC*rc,. ik'iscjue received liiin. Basque happened to 
Ik- in the cuurt -yard very conveniently, and as if he had had orders. 
It sunu'tiines iKipiHais that one says to a servant: '‘You will be on 
the watch for Monsieur So-and-so, when he comes.'' 

Bas&lt;[ue, williout waiting for Jean Valjean to come up to him,. 
a&lt;l&lt;lre.sstMi him ns follows: 

“Monsi(‘ur tlte Baron told me to ask monsieur whether he de- 
sires to go iqistairs &lt;u* to remain l)elow?’' 

“1 o remain below/' answered Jean Valjean. 

Bascpie, who was moreover absolutely respectful, opened the. 
door the iKisement room and said: “I will inform madame/' 

'Fhe room winch jean Valjean entered was an arched and damp 
basement, usia! as a cellar when necessary, looking upon the street, 
paved witli red tiles, and dimly lighted by a window with an iron, 
grating. 

11ie room was not of those which are harassed by the brush, the 
dtisti*r» and the l)room. In it the dust was tranquil. There the per- 
secution (d the s|nders had not been organised. A fine web, broadly 
spfi-ao out, very black, adorned with dead flies, ornamented one of 
the window-panes. 1'he room, small and low, was furntshed with a 
pile nf enqay bottles hea])ed up in one corner. The wall had been 
washed with a wash of yellow ochre, which wa.s scaling off in large 
Hakes. At the i*nd was a w^ooden mantel, oainted black, with a nar- 
row shelf. A fire was kindled, which indicated that somebody had 
aniici}&gt;ated Jean Val jean's answer: To remain heloxv. 

Two armchairs were placed at the corners of the fireplace. Be- 
tween the chairs was spread, in guise of a carpet, an old bed-side 
rug, shiuving more warp than wool. 

The room was lighted by the fire in the fireplace and the twilight 
frtiin the window. 

Jean Valjean was fatigued. For some days he had neither eaten 
nor slept, lie let himself fall into one of the arm-chairs. 

Basrjiu* rettirned, set a lighted candle upon the mantel, and re- 
tired. Jean Valjean, his head bent down and his chin upon his 
breast,’ not iced neither Basque nor. the candle.

Sudilenly he started tip. Cosctte was behind him. 

He had not seeiAer conic in, hut he hiul felt that siie was cnininjf. 
He turned. He gazed at her. She was :u!oral&gt;ly beautiful. But 
what he looked upon with that deep look, was not her beauty but her 
soul. 

“Ah, well!” exclaimed Cosette, “father, T knew that you were 
singular, but I .should never have thougliv this. Wluii '.nn ideaf 
Marius tells me that it is you who wish me to receive von lu^re." 
“Yes. it is I.” 

“I expected the atuswer. Well, I warn you that 1 am going to make 
a .scene. Let u.s begin at the beginning, luither. kiss me.” 

And she ofFercil her cheek. 

Jean Valjean remainetl motionless. 

“You do not .stir. I .see it. You act guilty. But it is all the same, 
1 forgive you. Jesus Chri.st .said : •( lil'eu the other cheek.' I lere it is. " 
And she offered the other cheek. 

Jean Valjean did not move. It .seemed as if his feel w&lt;‘re nailed to 
the floor, 

“This is getting serH)U.s.” said fosette. “What liave 1 done to you ? 
J declare I am confounded. You owe me amends. Vtm will dine with

“That is not true. T will have Monsieur t lillenormand ^cold you.

“Impossible." 

Cosette here lost ground a little. She ceased to 4»rder and p:isseil 
to questions. 

“But why not? and you choose the ugliest rtmiu in the hou^t• to 
see me In. It is horrible liere," 

“You know, madame, I am iK-euIiar, I have my whims." 

Cosette clapped her little iiaiuls together. 

"Madame 1 Slill'again! What does tliis mean?" 

Jean Valjean fixed ujxw her that tlistressing smile to which lie 
Bometimes nad recourse : 

“You have wished to be madame. You are so." 

“Not to you, father." 

“Don’t call me fsg;her any more." 

“What." 

“Call me Monsieur Jean. Jean, if you will." 

“You are no longer father? 1 am no longer Cosette ? Monsieur

“Well then?” . ■ 

“All is as usual;” 

“Why do you change your name ?” 

“You have certainly changed yours.” 

He smiled again with that same smile and added ; 

“.Since you are Madame Pontmercy I can surely he Monsieur

“I don’t understand anything about it. It is all nonsense ; i sliall

lie made no answer. , . . ..... 

She seized both his hands hastily and, with an irresistible im- 
pulse, raising them towards her face, she pressed them against her 
neck under her chin, which is a deep token of affection. 

“Oh !” said she to him, “be good !” 


And she continued : _ . ..... 

“This is what I call being good : being nice, coming to stay here, 
there are birds here as well as in the Rue Plumet, living with us, 
leaving that hole in the Rue de I’Homme Anne, hot giving us riddles 
to guess, l)cing like other people, dining with its, breakfasting with 
us, being my father.” 

He disengaged his hands. i. t. j » 

“You have no more need of a father, you have a husoana. 

Cosette could not contain herself. 

“I no more need of a father ! To things like that which have no 

common sense, one really doesn’t know what to say!” , . 

“If Toussaint was here,” replied Jean Valjean, like one who is in 
search of authorities and who catches at every straw, she would 
iie the first to acknowledge that it is Jrue'that I always had my 
peculiar ways. There is nothing new m this. I have always hked 

cold here. We can’t see clearly. It is horrid, too, to 
want to be Monsieur Jean. I don’t want you to talk so to me. 

“lust now, on my way here, answered Jean Valjean, I saw^

And with a bewitching sauciness, pressing Jjer teeth ^

And, growing suddenly .serious, she lookwl (ixediy at jean X'al- 
jean, an&lt;l adiled : 

“So you tlon’t like it that I am happy ?" 

Artlessness, tmeoiisciously, sometimes jamelrales very deep. This 
uuestiou, simple to fosetu", was severe to jean \':dje;in. t'osefte 
wished to scnitch ; she tore. 

Jean V’aljeangrew ptde. I'ora moment he did iml answer, then, 
with an imlescrihalde accent and talking to himself, he nmrnmred; 

“Her hajipiiiess was the aim of my life. N’mw. (lod may fa-ckon

“Ah, you have called me t osetie!'’ e.selaimrd she. 

And she sprang upon liis neck, 

Jean Valjean, in desperation, clasped her to his breast wiltflv. it 
seemed to him almost as if he were taking her liack. 

“Thank you, father !“ said Ornette to him, 

The transjKirt was Incoming poignant to jean Valjean. f ie gently 
put away Oisette’s arms, and took his hat, 

“Well?” said Cosette. 

Iean_ Valjean answered : 

“I will leave vmi'madame ; they are waiting for you." 

And, from the dtior, he avideti: 

“I railed yotj Cosette. Tell your hwsliand that that sliail not 
happen again. Pardon me." 

jean Valjean went out, leaving Cosette astounded at that enig- 
matic farewell.

longer exclaimed that she was cold, no longer talked of the parlour &gt; 
she avoided saying' either father or Monsieur Jean. She let him 
speak as he would. She allowed herself to be called madame. Only 
she betrayed a certain diminution of joy. She would have been sad, 
if sadness had been possible for her. 

It is probable that she had had one of those conversations with 
Marius, in which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains 
nothing, and satisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers 
docs not go very far beyond their love. 

The basement room had made its toilet a little. Basque had sup- 
pressed the bottles, and Nicolette the spiders. 

Every succeeding morrow brought Jean Valjean at the same 
hour. He came every day, not having the strength to take Marius’ 
words otherwise than to the letter. Marius made his arrangements, 
so as to be absent at the hours when Jean Valjean came. The house 
became accustomed to M. Fauchelevent’s new mode of life. Tous- 
.saint aided: “Matmctir always zvas just so,” she repeated. The 
grandfather issued this decree: “He is an original!” and all was 
said. Besides, at ninety, no further tie is possible ; all is juxtaposi- 
tion ; a new-comer is an annoyance. There is no more room ; all the 
haliits are formed. M. Fauchelcvent, M. Tranchelevent, Grandfather 
( iillcnonnand asked nothing better than to be relieved of “that gen- 
tleman.” He added : “Nothing is more common than these originals. 
They do all softs of odd things. No motive. The Marquis de Can- 
aples was worse. He bought a palace to live in the barn. They are 
fantastic appearances which people put on.” 

Nobody caught a glimpse of the nether gloom. Who could have 
guessed such a thing, moreover ? There are such piarshes in India ; 
the water seems strange, inexplicable, quivering when there is no 
wind; agitated where it should be calm. You see upon the surface 
this causeless boiling; you do not perceive the Hydra crawling at 
the bottom. 

Many men have thus a secret monster, a disepe which they feed, 
a dragon which gnaws them, a despair which inhabits their night. 
Such a man resembles other people, goes, comes. Nobody knows 
that he has within him a fearful parasitic pain, with a thousand 
teeth, which lives in the miserable man, who is dying of it. Nobody 
knows that this man is a gulf. It is stagnant, but deep. From time 
to time, a troubling, bf which we understand nothing, shows itself 
on its sur^ce. A mysterious wrinkle comes along, then vanishes, 
then Reappears ; a bubble of air rises and bursts. It is a little thing, 
it is terrible. It is the breathing of the unknown monster. 

Certain strange habits, coming at the time when others are gone, 
shrinking away while others make a display, wearing on all occa- 
sions what might be called the^ wall-coloured mantle, seeking tp&lt; 
solitary path, preferring the deserted street, not mingling in. con-

complete extinction. No more familiarity, no more good-day with 
a kiss, never again that word so intensely sweet: Father! he was, 
upon his own demand and through his own complicitys driven in 
succession from every happiness; and he had this misery, that 
after having lost Cosette wholly in one day, he had been olDliged 
afterwards to lose her again little by little. 

The eye at last becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In 
short, to have a vision of Cosette every day sufficed him. His whole 
life was concentrated in that hour. He sat by her side, he looked 
at her in silence, or rather he talked to her of the years long gore, 
of her childhood, of the convent, of her friends of those days. 

One afternoon — it was one of the early days of April, already 
warm, still fresh, the season of the great cheerfulness of the sun- 
shine*, the gardens which lay about Marius' and Cosette's windows 
felt the emotion of awakening, the hawthorn was beginning to 
peep, a jewelled array of gilliflowers displayed themselves upon 
the old walls, the rosy wolf-mouths gaped in the cracks of the stones, 
there was a charming beginning of daisies and buttercups in the 
grass, the white butterflies of, the year made their first appearance, 
the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding, essayed in the trees 
iki first notes of that grand auroral symphony which the old poets 
called tlitJ rcnomfcau — Marius said to Cosette: ^^We have said that 
we mrnhl go to see our garden in the Rue Plumet again. Let us go. 
We must tiot he ungrateful." And they flew away like two swallows 
towards the spring. This garden in the Rue Plumet had the effect 
of the (lawn upon them. They had behind them in life already some- 
thing wliich was like the spring time of their Jove. The house in the 
Rue Plumet Ijcing taken on a lease, still belonged to Cosette. The} 
wetP' to tins garden and this house. In it they found themselves 
again ; they forgot themselves. At night, at the usual hour, Jean Val- 
jean came to the Rite des Filles du Calvaire. ‘Madame has gope 
out with monsieur, and ha,s not returned yet,” sa,id Basque to him. 
lie Silt down in silence, and waited an hour. Cosette did not return 
He bowed his head and went away. 

Cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to the garden, and sfl 
harnw over having “lived a whole day in her past,” that she did not 
speak of anything else the next day. It did not occur to her that sha 

had not seen Jean Valjean. , 

“1 low did you go there?” Jean Valjean asked her. 

“We walked.” 

“And how did you return ?” 


For some time Jean Valjean had noticed the frugal life which tht 
vounc cmiiile led. He was annoyed at it. Marius economy ’(tos 
SSI ami the word to Jean Viljean had its absolute sense. He 


ventured a question ; 



1 190 L E S M I S &amp; R A B E E S 

“Why have you no carriage of your own? A iirctty hroijghutu 
would cost you only Jive hiimirec! francs a month. You are rich." 

“I don’t know,” answcretl Cosette. 

“So w'ith Toussaint,” contimied Jean \'alje:u!. “She has gone 
away. You have not replaced her. Why not ?" 

“Nicolette i.s eiwutgh." 

“But you inu.st h.ave a waiting niaid." 

"I lave n«»t I Marius?” 

“You ought to have a hott.se of your own, serwints of yrntr own, 
a carriage, a box at the theatre. There is rmthing too giMul for yott. 
Why not have the advantages of being rich? Uiches a&lt;Ul to happi- 
ness".” 

Cosette made no attswer. 

Jean Valjean's vi.sits di&lt;l not grow .shorter. I'ur from it. When the 
heart is slipping we do ntrt sli»p on the tlen'ent. ^ 

When Jean Valjean desired to prolong hi- visit, :uid to tiiake the 
hours pas.s unnoticetl, he eulogised M.irius ; he thought him hejinti- 
ful, noble, courageous, inlelleettial, eloijneut, good, Cosette sur- 
pas.sed him. Jean Valjean Iieg.in .again. They were never sileiit- 
Marius, this word was tnexluinsfihle ; there were volumes in these 
.six letters. In this w.\v Jeatj X'aijean Micm'de«i in staying a long time. 
To see Cosette, to forget at her sirie, it was so sweet to him. It was 
the staunehing of his wound. It hapjjened sevt-ra! times that Bastpie 
came down twice to say : “Mtui-sieur ( hllenormand sen*ls me to re- 
mind Madame the Baroness that rlinncr is served.” 

On tho.se day.s, Jean Valjean rcttirnetl home very thought ful. 

Wa.s there, then, some truth in that comjxirisou of the chrysalis 
which hat! presented itself to Marins* mind? Wa.s Jean V'aljean 
indeed a chrysalis who was obstinate, anti who came to make visits 
to his butterny. 

One day he stayed longer than usual. The next day, he iioiiced 
that there was no fire in the fireplace. "What !" thiui}^l he. "No fire.” 
And he made the cx|j|imation to hintself : “It is a matter of wuirse. 
We are in April, The cold weather is over,'* 

**Goodness I how cold it is here !'* exel,aiinc«! Cosette ns she came in. 

"Why no,” aaid Jean Valjean. 

“So It is you who told Basque not to make a fire ?" 

“Yes, We are close ujKin May." 

“But we have fire until the month of June, In this cellar, it is 
needed the year round.” 

“I thought that the fire was unnecessary.” 

"That is Just one of your kicM I" replied Cosette. 

The next day there was a fire. But the two arm-chairs were placed 

tlw other end of the room, near the door. “What doea that mean ?“ 
dioui^JewaVidjesua. ' 



JEAN VAl-JEAN 1191 

He went for the arm-chairs, and put them back in their usual 
place near the chimney. 

This fire being kindled' again' encouraged him, however. He con- 
tinued the conversation still longer than usual. As he w.as getting 
up to go away, Cosette said to him : 

“My hu.sband said a funny thing to me yesterday.” 

“What was it ?” 

“He said : ‘Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand francs,, 
Twenty-seven that you have, three that my grandfather allows me ' 
I an.swered : ‘That makes thirty.’ ‘Would you have the courage to 
live on three thousand?’ I answered: ‘Yes, on nothing. Provided it 
he with you.’ And then I asked : ‘Why do you say this ?’ He an- 
swered : "‘To know.’ ” 

Jean Valjcan did not say a word. Cosette probably expected some 
explanation from him ; he listened to her in a mournful silence. He 
went back to the Rue de I’Homme Arme ; he was so deeply absorbed 
that he mistook the door, and instead of entering his own house, he 
entered the next one. Not until he had gone up almost to the second 
story di(l he perceive his mistake, and go down again. 

I li.s mind was racked with conjectures. It was evident that Marius 
had doubts in regard to the origin of these six hundred thousand 
francs, that he feared some impure source, who knows ? that he had 
perhaps discovered that this money came from him, Jean Valjean, 
that lie hesitated before this suspicious fortune, and disliked to 
take it as his own, preferring to remain poor, himself and Cosette, 
than to be rich with a doubtful wealth. 

Be.sides, vaguely, Jean Valjean began to feel that the door was 
shown him. 

The next day, he received, on entering the basement room, some- 
thing like a shock. The arm-chairs had disappeared. There was not 

even a chair of any kind. _ , . , T*n. 

“Ah now,” exclaimed Cosette as she came m, no chairs 1 Where 

are the arm-chairs, then ?” 

“They are gone,” answered Jean Valjean. 

“That is a pretty businc.ss r 

Jean Valjean stammered: 

“I told Basque to take them away.’ 

“And what for?” 

“I shall stay only a few minutes to-day. 

“Staying a little while is no reason for standing while you do 

stsiv***' • &lt;1 

‘"‘I helieve that Basque needed some arm-chairs for the parlour. 

“What for?” „ 

“You doubtless have company this evening. 

“We have nobody.” 

Jean Valjean could not say a word more. 



1 192 l, K S MIS k R A It I. K S 

Cosette shrugged her shoulders. 

“To have the cliairs carried away! The tithcr day you had tlic 
fire jHJt out. How singular ytni are!" 

“Good"l»ye,’* murmured Jean Vuljean. 

Tie {liil not say : “Gond-hye, Cusette." But he had not llie strength 
to .say; “(iood-ltye, inatlame.” 

He went away nverwhehned. 

Thi.s time he had umlerstuod. 

The next day he tlid not emne, CVtselte did not lattice it until 
night. 

“Why,** .said .she, “Monsieur jean luts imt cotne to-day." 

She felt something like a .slight ttpjtrc.s^inn «if the hcait. hut she 
hardly perceived it, heing tnimediately diveriet! hy a kiss from 
Marius. 

The next day he did not ctnne. 

Cosctle p:iid no alleiuion to it. pjissfd the evening ant! slept as 
mual, and thought of it only on .iwrikiiig. .‘she was so liajiity ! .She

But the remark esenixsd the notice of Nicolcite,' w!io reported 
nothing of it to Cosette.

ATTRACTtn.sj AXl» KXTINCriOS 

During the last months of ilie spring and the first months of the 
aummer of 1833, the .scattered wayfarers in the Marais, the sturc- 
k&lt;»per8, tive idlers ujxjn the dfairsirps, noticed an olit ninn neatly 
dressed in black, every clay, about the same hour, at night* fall, c«»me 
out of the Rue de rHomme AnmJ, in the direction of ilie Hue .Sainte 
Croix de la Rrctnnncric, pass by the Blancs Manteaux, to the Rue 
Culture Saintc Catherine, and, reaching the Rue de I’l^charpe, turn 
to the left, and enter the Rue Saint I juiis. 

There he walked with slow steps, his h«d bent forward, seeing 
nothing, hearing nothing, his eye Immovably fixed upon one point, 
always the same, which seemed studded with stars to him, and which 
was nothing more nor less than the corner of die Roe des FlUea du 
C^valre. As he approadied the cortMer of ttUM; atreet, hit hsce 



JEANVALJEAN 1 193 

lighted up; a kind of joy illuminated his eye like an interior halo, 
he had a fascinated and softened expression, his lips moved vaguely, 
as if he were speaking to some one whom he did not see, he smiled 
faintly, and he advanced as slowly as he could. You would have 
said that even while wishing to reach some destination, he dreaded 
the moment when he should be near it. When there were but a few 
houses left between him and that street, which appeared to attract 
him, hi.s pace became so slow,, that at times you might have sup- 
posed he had ceased to move. The vacillation of his head and the 
iixednes.s of his eye reminded you of the needle seeking the pole. 
However long he succeeded in deferring it, he must arrive at last ; 
he reached the Rue des Filles du Calvaire; then he stopped, he 
trembled, he ptit his head with a kind of gloomy timidity beyond the 
corner of the last house, and he looked into that street, and there 
was in that tragical look something which resembled the bewilder- 
ment of the impossible, and the reflection of a forbidden paradise. 
Then a tear, which had gradually gathered in the corner of his eye, 
grown large enough to fall, glided over his cheek, and. sometimes 
stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted its bitterness. He re- 
mained thus a few minutes, as if he had been stone ; then he re- 
turned by the same route and at the same pace ; and, in proportion 
as he receded, that look was extinguished. 

I.ittle l)y little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of 
the Rti« des .Filles du Calvaire ; he stopped half way down the Rue 
Saint I..x,mis ; sometimes a little further, sometimes a little nearer. 
One day, he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture Sainte Cath- 
erine, and looked at the Rue des Filles du Calvaire from the^ dis- 
tance. Then he silently moved his head from right to left as if he 
were refusing himself something, and retraced his steps. _ 

Very soon he no longer came even as far as the Rue Saint Louis.. 
He reuchtnl the Rue Pavee, shook his head, and went back; then he 
no longer went beyond the Rue des Trois Pavilions; then he no 
longer passed the Blancs Manteaux. You would have said a pen- 
dulum which has not been wound up, and the oscillations of which 
are growing shorter ere they stop. . 

Every day, he came out of his house at the same hour, he com- 
menced the same walk, but he did not finish it, and, perhaps uncon- 
sciously, he continually .shortened it. His whole countenance ex- 
pressed thi.s .single idea; What is the use? The eye was dull; no 
more radiance, 'i’he tear also was gone ; it no longer gathered at the 
corner of the lids ; tlrnt thoughtful eye was dry. The old man s head, 
was still bent forward ; his chin quivered at times ; the wrinkly 
of his thin neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, 'when the 
weather was had, he carried an umbrella under his am. ^'vroich he 
never opened. The good women of the quartier said: He is a 
natural.” The children followed him laughing.

JEAN VALJEAN 1195 

of his unspoken wishes, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this 
consisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She had to 
make no elfort for that. Without knowing why herself, and without 
aiTording any grounds for censure, her soul had so thoroughly 
heeome lier lius1)and’s soul, that whatever was covered with shadow 
in Marius* thought, was obscured in hers. 

We must not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, 
this forgetfulness and this obliteration were only superfxial. She 
was rallier thoughtless than forgetful. At heart, she really loved 
liini whom slie had so long called father. But she loved her husband 
still more. It was that which had somewhat swayed the balance of 
this licart, inclined in a single direction. 

It soinctimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean, and 
wondered, d'hen Marius calmed her: “He is absent, I think. Didn’t 
he say that he was going away on a journey ?” “That is true,’’ thought 
Cos(‘ite. “He was in the liabit of disappearing in this way. But not 
for so long.” Two or three times she sent Nkolette to inquire in the 
Rne de ri iominc Arme if Monsieur Jean had returned from his 
journey. Jean Valjean had the answer retunied that he had not. 

Voselle clid not inquire further, having but one need on earth, 
Marius. 

We must also say that, on their part, Marius and Cosette had been 
absent. 'They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his 
father’s grave. 

Marius had little by little withdrawn Cosette from Jean Valjean, 
Cosri te was {passive. 

IMan-ern er, wliat is called much too harshly, in certain cases, the 
ingratiinde of children, is not always as blameworthy a thing as is 
siip])ost:&lt;l. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have said 
elsewhere, “looks forward/’ Nature divides living beings into the 
coming an&lt;l the going. The going are turned towards the shadow, 
tlu! coming towards the light. Hence a separation, wITich, on the 
T)art of the old, is a fatality, and, on the part of the young, involun- 
tarv. 1'lus se])aration, at first insensible, gradually increases, like 
(n'crv se]):iration of branches. The limbs, without parting from the 
trunk, re&lt;'&lt;^dc from it. It is not their fault. Youth goes where joy 
is to f(‘slivals, to brilliant lights, to loves. Old age goes to its ^d. 
liicv &lt;lo w\ lose sight of each other, but the ties are loosened. The 
all ed ion of tlie young is chilled by life ; that of the old by the grave. 
W'c must not blame these poor children.

exclaimed ; 

“Why, yntt didn't cat anythinii yesterday, jhioj- tlear man!’' 

“Yes, 1 did,” answered )eaa Valjean. 

“The plate is all full.'* 

“l.i«tk at the water-[titcher. That is empty." 

“That .slu»v\ts that you have drtnik ; it &lt;lnn't show that yon lutve

“Well,” said Jean Valjean, "snpjtose 1 have only heeii hmnpy

“That is calk’d thirst, ,'tnd, when people don’t e.it at the s.niic

jean Valjean took the old wtanan's hand ; 

"I j»romise to eat it," said he to her in In', heiievolrnt voice. 

“1 am mrt sati.sticd with yon," answered the poriiess, 

Jean Valjean scarcely ever .saw_ .any oilu r limnan heiiifj than 
thrtgood woman. There are slrwis in I'at is in which nolindy walks, 
and houses into which nolxidy conies, Me was in one of ihose streets, 
and in one of those houses. 

While he still went tnil, he had IxwtRhl tif a hrazier for a few 
sous a little copiier crncili.\, which he ha«l limiK uj«mi u nail hr f orc-

it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad match.’’ 

The porter replied, with the acrciit of the marital sovereignty : 

"If he is rich, let him have a dwtur. If he is not rich, let hiiil nut 
have any. If he dnesn’t have a doctor, he will die." 

“And if he due,s have one?" 

"He will die." said the' jKjricr. 

The portress fiegan to dig up with an old knife some ^ts« which

puUit^ up the grass, she muttered ; 

"It Is a pity. An old man who is so nic« ! He is white as m chicken." 



JEAN VALJEAN 1197 

She saw a physician of the quartier passing at the end of the street } 
sh(! took it upon herself to beg him to go up. 

“It is on the .second floor,” said she to him. “You will have nothing 
to do hut go in. As the goodman does not stir from his bed now, the 
key is iii the door all the time.” 

'I'he physician saw Jean Valjean, and spoke with him. 

Wlien he came down, the portress questioned him: 

“Well, doctor?” 

"Your .sick man is very sick.” 

"What is the matter with him?” 

"Kverything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearance 
has lost some dear friend. People die of that.” 

"What tlid he tell you?” 

"i If told me that he was well.” 

"Will you come again, doctor?” 

answered the physician. “But another than I must come

A I’E.M IS IIKAVT TO HIM WHO LIFTED PAUCHELEVENT'S CART 

Onk f veiling lean Valjean had difficulty in raising himself upon his , 
elbow ; he felt'hts wrist and found no pulse ; his breathing was short, 
and sto|»iml at intervals : he reali.sed that he was weaker than he had 
iiecii before, 'riien, undoubtedly un&lt;ler the pressure of some supreme 
desire, he made an elTort, sat up in bed, and dressed himself. He 
nut on his old working-man’s garb. As he went opt no longer, he had 
returned to it. and he preferred it. He was obliged to stop several 
times while dressing; the mere effort of putting on his waistcoat, 
made the sweat roll down his forehead. , . , ^ , 

Since he had Ix-en alone, he had made his bed m the ante-room, 
so as tu occupy this desolate tenement as little as iwssible. 

He opened the valise and took out Cosette’s suit. 

He .spread it out uiKin his bed. ^ * i xr-

glass imitation comes from Germany. The jet is lighter, more 
precious, more costly. We can make imitations in France as well as 
in Germany. It requires a little anvil two inches square, and a spirit- 
lamp to soften the wax. The wax was formerly made with resin 
and lamp-black, and cost four francs a pound. I hit upon making it 
with gum lac and turpentine. This costs only thirty sous, and it is 
much better. 1 he buckles are made of violet glass, which is fast- 
ened by means of this wax to a narrow rim of black iron. The glass 
should be violet for iron trinkets, and the black for gold trinkets. 

Spain purchases many of them. That is the country of jet 

Here he stopped, the pen fell from his fingers, he gave way to one 
of lliose despairing sobs which rose at times from the depths of his 
being, tlie poor pian clasped his head with both hands, and reflected. 

“Oh !’’_e.xdaimcd he within himself (pitiful cries, heard by God 
alone) , “it is all over. I shall never see her more. She is a smile which 
has_ passed over me. I am going to enter into the night without even 
.seeing her again. Oh 1 a minute, an instant, to hear her voice, to touch 
her dress, to look at her, the angel ! and then to die ! It is nothing to 
die, but it is dreadful to die without seeing her. She would smile 
upon nje, .she would say a word to me. Would that harm anybody? 
No, it is over, forever. Here I am, all alone. My God! my God! I 
shall nt'ver sec her again.” 

At this moment there was a rap at his door. 


IV 

A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH SERVES ONLY TO WHITEN 

That very day, or rather that very evening, just as Marius had left 
the table and retired into his office, having a bundle of papers to 
study over, Basque had handed him a letter, saying ; “the person 
wlio’wrnte the letter is in the antechamber.” 

Cosette had taken grandfather’s arm, and was walking in the 
garden. 

A letter, as well as a man, may have a forbidding appearance. 
Coarse i)a])er, cluniisy fold, the mere sight of certain missives dis- 
pleases. The letter which Basque brought was of this kind. 

Marius took it. It smelt of tobacco. Nothing awakens a reminis- 
ccnce like an odour. Marius recognised this tobacco. He looked at 
the address: To Monsieur, Monsieur the Baron Pommerci. In his 
The recognition of the tobacco made him recognise the hand- 
writing. We might say that astonishment has its flashes. Marius 
wa.*!, as it were, illuminated by one of those flashes. 

The scent, the mysterious aid-memory, revived a whole world 
within hint. Xlcre was the very paper, the manner of folding, the 
paleness of the ink ; here was, indeed, the well-known handwrith^;

He broke the seal eagerly, aiui read :

The letter was signed "Tiif n ako." 

This signamre was not a false one, It was only a little abridged. 

Besides the rigmarole and the orili"graiiliy tomphred the reve- 
lation. The ceriific.atc of origin was perfeii, "niere was im doiilit

The emotion of Marius was deep, .'\ftrr llm feelitrg of surprise,

whom he sought, the in.an who had saved him, M.iriu.s, and he

Bas^ api^red. 

'*Sbow him in," said Marius. 

Basque annminced: 

*^Monsieur Th^uu-d." 

A nnn entered. 

A new surprise for Marius. The man who came in was perfectly 
mdcrmwn to him.

green spectacles, with doubhi shade of green silk over bis &lt;wes. his

tidy black ; a bunch of trinkets, hanging from his fob, suggested 
a watch. He held an old hat in his hand. He walked with a stoop, 
and the crook of his back increased the lowliness of His bow. 

What was striking at first sight was, that this person's coat, 
too full, although carefully buttoned, did not seem to have been made 
for him. Here a short digression is necessary. 

There was in Paris, at that period, in an old shanty, in the Rue 
Beautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew, whose business 
it was to change a rascal into an honest man. Not for too long a 
time, which might have been uncomfortable for the rascal. The 
change was made at sight, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty 
sous a day, by means of a costume, resembling, as closely as possible, 
that of honest people generally. This renter of costumes was called 
the Changer; the Parisian thieves had given him this name, and 
knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The 
rags with which he tricked out his people were almost respectable. 
He had specialties and categories ; upon each nail in his shop, hiing, 
worn and rumpled, a social condition ; hei*e the magistrate's dress, 
there the cure's dress, there the banker's dress, in one corner the 
retired soldier's dress, in another the literary man's dress, further 
on the statesman's dress. This man was the costumer of the im-' 
mense drama which knavery plays in Paris. His hut was the green- 
room whence robbery came forth, and whither swindling returned. 
A ragged rogue came to this wardrobe, laid down thirty sous, and 
chose, according to the part which he wished to play that day, the 
dress which suited him, and, when he returned to the street, the 
rogue was somebody. The next day the clothes were faithfully 
brought back, and the Changer, who trusted everything to the rob- 
bers, was never robbed. These garments had one inconvenience,, 
they ^‘were not a fit;" not hping been made for those who wore 
them, they were tight for this man, baggy for that, and fitted ho- 
body. Every thief who exceeded the human average in smallness 
or in bigness, was ill at ease in the costumes of the Changer. He 
must be neither too fat nor too lean. The Changer had provided 
only for ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species in 
the person of the first chance vagabond, who was neither thick nor 
thin, neither tall nor §hort. Hence adaptations, sometimes difficult, 
with which the Changer's customers got along as well as they coulA 
So much the worse for the exceptions ! The Statesman's dress- for 
instance, black from top to toe, and consequently suitable, v 
have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. 
Statesman's suit was described as follows in the 
logue; we copy: '*A black cloth coat, pantaloom 
mTUed cassimere, a silk waistcoat, boots, and Km 
the margin : ** Ancient ambassador/' and a note w 
jBcribe ; "Tn a separate box, a wig neatly

trinkets, and two little quill fnlK‘.s an inch in length wrapped in cot- 
ton.” 'rhi.s all went with the Statesman, ancient ainliassador. This 
entire cnstnme was, if we may use the word, einaciateii; the seams 
were turning white, an undefined Imtlonlutle was appearing at one 
of the elhinvs; tnoreover a hntton was inissing un the hreast of the 
coat; Inil this was a slight matter; as the Stateman's hand ought 
always to he witliin the coat and ttpun the heart, its function was’ to 
conceal the alisent liniton, 

If Marins had been familiar with ihetHTuh institutions of Paris 
he would have recognised inimetliately, on the liaek of tin; visitor 
■whom Basque had jiist introduced, the Sltitesman's coat liorrowed 
from the I'nliiKik-ine-llmt of the flumger. 

Marins' disiqipnintnuMii, on seeing another man enter than the 
one he was esjuvting, turned into dislike towards the new comer, 
lie e.xamined him from head to foot, while the personage howed 
without me.istire, and asked him in ,*i sharp tone; 

“What tin yon want ?” 

The man answeretl with an aniialtle grin of which the caressing 
smile of a crociHlile would give some idea : 

“It seenis to me iinpos-'ihle that I have not already had the hon- 
our tif seeing Monsieur the Baron in socieiv, I really liiiuk that I 
met him privately some years ago. at Mailame ihe Princess Bagra- 
tion’s niul in the salons tif hi^ lonBliip the N isconnt 1 tuiuhrav. i&gt;eer 
of France." 

It is always good tactics in rascality to pretend to reeitgnise one 
whom you do n&lt;»t know. 

Manus listened alluiuively to tlie voice of this man. He w,atched 
for the tone and gesture eagerly, hut Ids tlisajiisditimeut increased; 
it was a whining pronunciation, entirely diiierent from the sharp 
and dry .sound of voice which he ex|ncled. He was completely he- 
wiltleretl. 

“I don’t know," said he. “eiiher Mailame Bagration or M. Dam- 
hray. I have never in my life set fimt in the house of either the one 
or the other." 

The answer was testy. The |)erson. gnicious not withstanding, 
persisted; 

“Then it must lie at Gialeauhriand's that I have seen monsieur? 
1 know Chafeauliriand well. He is very afTatde. I le say.s to me some- 
times; ’Th^nard, my friend, won’t you drink a glass of wine with 
me?’"_ 

Marius* brow grew more and more severe : 

"I have never had the honour of licing received at Monsieur de 
^ateaubriand's. Come to the point. What is it you wish ?" 

The man, In view of the harsher voice, made a lower bow.

is composed of a single house. A large, square, three-story adobe 
house, each side of the square five hundred feet long, each story 
set back twelve feet from the story below, so as to leave in front a 
terrace which runs round the building, in the centre am interior 
court in which are provisions and ammunition, no windows, loop- 
holes, no door, ladders, ladders to mount from the ground to the 
first terrace, and from the first to the second, and from the second . 
to the third, ladders to descend into the interior court, no doors to 
the rooms, hatchways, no stairs to the rooms, ladders ; at night the 
hatchways are closed, the ladders drawn in : swivels and carbines 
are aimed through the port-holes ; no means of entering ; a house by 
day, a citadel by night, eight hundred inhabitants, such is this village. 
Why so much precaution ? because the country is dangerous ; it is 
full of anthropophagi. Then why do people go there ? because that 
country is wonderful ; gold is found there.” 

“What are you coming to ?” Marius interrupted, who from disap- 
pointment was passing to impatience. 

“To this. Monsieur Baron. I am an old weary diplomatist. The old 
civilisation has used me up. I wish to try the savages.” 

“What then?” 

“Monsieur Baron, selfishness is the law of the world. The prole- 
tarian country-woman who works by the day, turns round when the 
diligence jxisses, the proprietary country-woman who works in her 
own field, does not turn round. The poor man’s dog barks at the rich 
man, the rich man’s dog barks at the poor man. Every one for him- 
,self. Interest is the motive of men. Gold is the loadstone.” 

“What then? Conclude.” 

“I would like to go and establish myself at La Joya. There are 
three of us. I have my spouse and my young lady ; a girl who is very 
beautiful. 'J'he voyage is long and dear. I must have a little money.” 

“How does that concern me ?” inquired Marius. 

^ The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a movement 
characteristic of the vulture, and replied, with redoubled smiles : 

“Then Monsieur the Baron has not read my letter ?” 

That was not far from true. The fact is, that the contents of the 
epistle had glanced off from Marius. He had seen the handwriting 
rather than read the letter. He scarcely remembered it. Within a 
moment a new clue had been given him. He had noticed this remark : 
My spouse and my young lady. He fixed a searching eye upon the 
stranger. An examining judge could not have done better. He seemed 
to be lying in ambush for him. He answered : 

“Explain.” 

The stranger thrust his hands into his fobs, raisecj his head with- 
out straightening his backbone, but scrutinising Marius in his turn 
with the green gaze of his spectacles. 



1204 L E S M r S f: R A li L K s 

“Certainly, Monsieur the Baron. 1 will explain. I have a secret 
to sell you.” 

“A secret ?” 

“A secret.” 

“Which c(&gt;m'ern.s me?” 

“Somewhat." 

“What is this secret?” 

Marius e.Kainiiie&lt;l the man more and more closely, while listening 
to him. 

"I commence gratis,” said the stranger. “Yon will .see that I am 
interesting.” 

“Co on.” 

“Monsieur Baron, ytui have in yonr house a roldter and an assa.s- 
sin." 

Marius .shtuhlered. 

“In tuy house? no,”- said he. 

The stranger, imperlurbalde, Ijrushvil his hut with his sleev**, and 
continued : 

“A.ssassin and robber. Observe, ^Fonsienr B:irnn. tliat I &lt;Jo not 
speak here of act.s, old, hygoiu*. and witheretl, which may he can- 
celled by prescriptitm in the eye of the law, and by repentaiiec in the 
eye of Cod. I sneak uf recent act.s, presrnit acts, acts yet imkn&lt;»w!i to

confidejice, and almost into your family, im«ler a false name. I ata 
going to tdl you his true name. And to tell it to you for nothing.” 

“I am listening." 

“Ills name is jean Valjean.” 

“I know it." 

"I am going to tell you, also for nothing, who he is." 

“Say on.” 

“He i.s an old cotivkt." 

“I know it.” 

“You know it since I h.ave hatl the honour of telling you.” 

“No. I knew it before." 

Marius* coo! tone, that double reply, / A-iiow it, his laconic 
snethod of speech, embarra.ssing to conversation, excited some sup- 
oressed anger in the stranger. He shot furtively at Marins a furious 
^k, whidn.was immediately extinguished. Quick a,s it was, this 
yck was one of those which are rect^ised after they have once 
‘VM&gt;n ; it did not escape Marias. Certain flames can only come 
'min souls ; the eye, that window of the thought, biases with 
les hide nothing ; you might as well put a glaas over helL 
uiger r^umed with a smile :

tune of Madame the Baroness. It is an extraordinary secret. It is 
for sale. I offer it to you first. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs'.” 

“I know that secret as well as the others,” said Marius. 

The person felt the necessity of lowering his price a little. 

“Monsieur Baron, say ten thousand francs, and I will go on.” 

“I repeat, that you have nothing to acquaint me with. I know what 
you wish to tell me.” 

'J’here wa.s a new flash in the man’s eye. He exclaimed : 

“Still 1 must dine to-day. It is an extraordinary secret, I tell you. 
Monsieur the Baron, I am going to speak. I will speak. Give me 
twenty francs.” 

Marius looked at him steadily : _ ^ 

“I know your extraordinary secret ; just as I knew Jean Valjean s 
name : just as 1 know your name.” 

“Myname?” 

“Yes.” , , ^ 

“'I'htit is not difficult. Monsieur Baron. I have had the honour of 
writing it to you and telling it to you. Thenard.” 


“Dier.” 

“Kh?” 

“Thcnardier.” 

** Wlu) is thtit ?** 

In danger the porcupine bristles, the beetle feigns death, the Old 
(itiard forms a square ; this man began to laugh. , , . 

Then, with a fillip, he brushed a speck of dust from ms coat- 


sleeve. 

Marius continued ; , , , j- -r- t 

"You are also the working-man Jondrette, the comedian Faban- 
tmi, the poet Genflot, the Spaniard Don Alvar^, and the woman 
Balizard." 

"The woman what?” » 

**And you have kept a chop-house at Montfermeil. 

“A chop-house! never.” 

“And 1 tell you that you are Thenardier. 

**I deny it/* ,, 

"And that you are a scoundrel. Here.” , 

And Marius, taking a bank-note from his pocket, threw it m his 

“Thanks ! pardon ! five hundred francs ! Monsieur Baron !” _ 
And the man, bewildered, bowing, catching the note, examined 

**’"Five hundred francs!” he repeated in astonishment. And he 
stammered out in an undertone! A stnons fapat. 

“We"n so"be it.” exclaimed he. “Let us make ourselves comfor- 

table.”

And, with the aKility of a nmnla-y, thniwin^' his hair oiT back- 
wards, pulliiif? nff his sjHTtaclcs, taking dut of his nose an&lt;! puckct- 
iiig the two (juill tubes of wliich we havi! just spoken, and wliich 
tvi! have already seen elsewliere on .another paj^e of this book, he 
took oir his count enattce as one lakes otV his hat. 

His eye kindled ; his forehead, uneven, ravined, humped in spots, 
aideoHsiy wrinkled at the toj&gt;, emei-f'ed ; his jmse became as sharj) a.s 
a he.ak; the tierce and cunniii}; profile of the man of prev nppe.ared 
again. 

“Monsieur the Raron is inftiinhle.” said he in .a clear voice from 
which all nasality lias disappeared, "1 am 'riienardier.'' 

And he straightened his bent back. 

Thennrdier, for jt was indeed he, was strangely surprisetl; he 
would iwve been disconeerted if he could have heeii, lie hud come 
to bring astouishmciil, and he hiin&gt;t'!f received it. ‘I'lns hu!nili!!tiiiii 
had been compensated liv live hnndreil fraiu s, ami. ;il! things con- 
aitlered, he accepted it ; hut he was none the less astounded. 

^ He saw this llaroti I’uniniercv for the fust time, ami. in sjiite of 
hi.s clisguise, this Baron Ponlmercy nvognised him. and recognised 
him tliortiiiglily. .And not only w^:is this huinn fully infornied, in 
reganl to 'liieiiardier, hut lie seemed fully informed in rcgtird ttu 
Je.un Valjean. W’ho was this almost beardless young ni;m, so icy 
and .so generous, wlto knew people'.s names, who knew all their 
names, ami who opened his purse to them, who ahtised rogues like 
a judge and who p;tid them like a dupe ? 

Thenardier, it will lie rememl«*rt&gt;d. although lie Itad been ,n ueigh- 
bmtr of Marius, had never seen hint, which is frctjueii! in Paris; iie 
had once heard some talk of his daughters ainmt a very jamr yoimg

without knowing him, the letter wliich we have seen. Xo eoimectioii

Through his daughter Azelina, however, whom he lm&lt;l put mion

his own re.searches, he had siieemletl in finding out many tilings, 
and, from the depth of his darkness, lie had lieen able to sri*e nun 
than one mysterious clue. He had, by clint of industry, discovered, 
or, at least, by dint of induction, gucsseil who the man was wltutn 
he had met on a certain day in the (Jraiul .Sewer, I**nim the man. he 
had easily arrived at the name. He knew that Madame the Baroness 
Ponlmercy was Cnsclfe. But, in that rcsfiect, he intended to Ik pru- 
dent. Who was Co-scue? He tlid not know exactly himself. He sus- 
pected indeed some illegitimacy. Fantinc’i story had always seemed 
to him ambiguous ; but why speak of it ? to get paid for his silence? 
He had, or tnov^t he had, something better to sell than that And to 
aO ai^rtuices, to come and make, without any proof, this revda^

to Baron Pontmercy : Your wife is a bastard, would only have at- 
tracted the husband’s boot towards the revelator’s back. 

In Thcnardier’s opinion, the conversation with Marius had not 
}'ct coininenced. Pie had been obliged to retreat, to modify his strat- 
egy, to al.)andon a position, to change his base ; but nothing essential 
was yet lost, and he had five hundred francs in his pocket. More- 
over, he had something decisive to say, and even against this Baron 
Poiitmcrcy, so well informed and so well armed, he felt himself 
strong. To men of Thenardier’s nature, every dialogue is a battle. 
In that which was about to be commenced what was his situation? 
He did not Icnow to whom he was speaking, but he knew about what 
he was speaking. He rapidly made this interior review of his forces, 
rind after saying: ‘7 am Thcnardicr,” he waited. 

Marins remained absorbed in thought. At last, then, he had caught 
Hienardier ; this man, whom he had so much desired to find again, 
wa.s before him : so he would be able to do honour to Colonel Pont- 
niercy’s injunction. He was humiliated that that hero should owe 
anything to this bandit, and that the bill of exchange drawn by his 
father from the depth of the grave upon him, Marius, should have 
l)e(‘n |)rolested until this day. It appeared to him, also, in the complex 
position of his mind with regard to Thenarciier, that here was an 
o|iport unity to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been 
saved I)y such a rascal. However that might be, he was pleased. He 
was al)(nit to deliver the coloncrs shade at last from his unworthy 
creditor, and it seemed to liirn that he was about to release his father’s 
metnnry from imprisonment for debt. 

Besides this duty, he had another, to clear up, if he could, the 
source of Cosette’s fortune. The opportunity seemed to present 
itself. Thenardier knew something, perhaps. It might be useful to 
probe tliis man to the IxHtoni. Pie began with that. 

Hienardier had slipped the “serious fafiot' into his fob, and was 
looking at Marius with an almost affectionate humility. 

Marius interrupted the silence. 

**Tluhiardier, I have told you your name. Now your secret, what 
yon came to make known to me, do you want me to tell you that? 
1 have my means of information. You shall see that I know more 
about it than you do. Jean Valjcan, as you have said, is an assassin 
and a rol)bcr.X robber, because he robbed a rich manufacturer, M. 
Madtdeine, whose ruin he caused. An assassin, because he assassx- 
mxU d the police-officer, Javert/' . , . .. 

"1 don’t understand, Monsieur Baron,” said Thenardier. 

“1 will make myself understood. Listen. There was, in an arron- 
dissement of tlie I\is-de-Calais, about 1822, aman who had had some 
tdd difficulty with justice, and who, under the name of M. Madeleine, 
liad ref fanned and re-established himself. He had become m the 
force of the term an upright man. By means of a manufacture, that

jf black glass triijkets, he had maik the furtune of an entire city. 
As for his own personal fortune, he harl made it also, but seeuini- 
arily, and, in sonic sort, inciflenlally. He was the foster-father of 
the poor. He founded hospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, 
endowed daugliters, supported witiows, ailopiet! (.rphans; iu* was,

himself — hy mean.s of a false signatme, a sum of more th;m half

little to tell me, Jean Valjean killed the ol'f'u er j.tveri ; he killed Itiiit 
withapistol. I, who am now spcakii.g to yon, 1 was present. ” 

Thcnardier cast upon Marins the sovereign glance of a heaten 
man, who lays hold on victory again, and who has just recovere&gt;i iit 
one minute all the ground wliieh he had lost. Hut the smile relunieil 
tmmediately ; the inferior before the superior can onlv have a .skulk- 
ng triTuniiii, and Theiiardier merely said to .Marine: 

“Monsieur Itaron, we are on the wrong Hack," 

And he einithasised this phrase Ity giving his hunch of trinkets 
an expressive twirl. 

“What!" replied M.arius, “do you deny tliut-' I'lieM* are facts," 

“They arc eiiimeras. ‘i he e«inlideiiee wiili wliich .Vloii'-ieur the 
Baron hoiionrs me tnakes it my duty to tell him so. Before all things, 
truth and justice. I do not like to see people accused unjustly. Mou- 
Bteur Baron, Jean Valjean never robbed Muiisieur Madeleine, and 
Jean Valjean never killed j.averl." 

“You speak strongly ! how is that ?*' 

“For two reasons.”' 

“What are they ? tel! me.” 

“The first i.s this: lietlitl not nth Monsieur Madeleine, .since it in 
Jeen Valjean himself who was Monsieur Maileleinc," 

“What is that you are telling me ?" 

“And the second is this : he thd not Bs.sa.ssinate Invert , since javert 
himself killed Javert." 

“What do you mean ?" 

“That Javert committed suicide," 

“Prove it ! prove it 1" cried Marius, hestde himself. 

Tiuburdier resumed, scanning his plirase in the fashion of an 
ancient Alexandrine: 

poMce— of — ^ficer-^a— -vert — was — found — drowned—

“Btn piWB it now r* . 



JEANVALJEAN 1209 

Thcnardier took from his pocket a large envelope of grey paper, 
which seemed to contain folded sheets of different sizes. 

“I have my documents/' said he, with calmness. 

And he added : 


‘‘Monsieur Baron, in your interest, I wished to find out Jean Val- 
jean to the bottom. I say that Jean Valjean and Madeleine are the 
same man ; and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert ; 
and when I speak I have the proofs. Not manuscript proofs; writ- 
ing is suspicious ; writing is complaisant, but proofs in print.^’ 

While speaking, Thenardier took out of the envelope two news- 
papers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One of 
these two newspapers, broken at all the folds, and falling in square 
pieces, seemed much older than the other. 

‘*Two facts, two proofs,” said Thenardier. And unfolding the 
two papers, he handed them to Marius. 

* With these two newspapers the reader is acquainted. One, the 
oldest, a copy of the Drapeau Blanc, of the 25th of July, 1823. the 
text of which can be found on page 304 of this book, established 
the identity of M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean. The other, a Monin 
Unir of the 15th of June, 1832, verified the suicide of Javert, add- 
itig that it appeared from a verbal report made by Javert to the 
prefect that, taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de la 
Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insur- 
gent who, though he had him at the muzzle of his pistol, instead of 
blowing out his brains, had fired into the air. 

Marius read. There was evidence, certain date, unquestionable 
proof; those two newspapers had not been printed expressly to 
support Idninardier^s words. The note published in the Moniteur 
was an official communication from the prefecture of police. Marius 
could not doubt. The information derived from the cashier was false, 


and he himself was mistaken. Jean Valjean, suddenly growmg 
grand, arose from the cloud. Marius could not restrain a cry of joy: 

“Well, then, this unhappy man is a wonderful man! all that for- 
tune was really his own ! he is Madeleine, the providence of a whole 
region ! he is Jean Valjean, the saviour of Javert ! he is a hero ! he is 
II, saint!” 

“lie is not a saint, and he is not a hero,” said Thenardier. “He fe 


an assassin and a robber,” 

And he added with the tone of a man who begins to feel some 
authority in himself : “Let us be calm.” 

Roliber, assassin ; these words, which Marius supposed were gone, 
yet which came back, fell upon him like a shbwer of ice. 

“Again,” said he, 

“Still," said Thenardier. “Jean Valjean did not rob Maddemc, 
tait he is a robber. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer.” ■ 

“Will you soeak,” resumed Marius, “of that petty taeft of fort?/

years ago, expiattHl, as appears from your newspapers themselves, 
by a whole life of rcjientauee, ahnegaiioii, and virtue?” 

“I said assassination and robbery, Monsieur ISanvn. And I repeat 
that I speak of recent facts. What 1 have to reveal to you is abso* 
lutely unknown. It lielongs to the u’npubli.shed. .And perlitips you 
will find in it the .source of the forluiu; adroitly presentwi by Jean 
Vaijean to Madame the Baroness, i .s;iy ailroitly, ft»r. by a donation 
of this kind, to glide into tin honouralile house, the ertinforts of 
which he will share, and, hy the .same stroke, to etuieeii! his crime, 
to enjoy his rohhery, to bury his ntime, ami to crtMte himseif a fam- 
ily, that would not he \'ery unskilful.” 

“1 might interrupt yoti’ here," okserveil .Marius ; “hut continue." 

“Monsieur Baron, I will tell you till. letiving the nvompeiise to 
your generosity. This secret is worth ;i pile of gold. 'I'ou will s;iy to 
me: why have you not gone to Jean V.iljean? lAtr a very siitiple 
reason: I know that he lias dispossessed himself, and disiiossessed 
in your favour, and I tliink the coiitrivtinee ingenious; hut he litis 
not a sou left, he would .show me his empty htmds, atid. since 1 need 
some money hir my voytige to I a Joyti, I prefer you, who have till, 
to him who has nothing, 1 tun somewhat fatigued ; allow me to take a 
chair." 


Marius sat down, and inade sign to him to sit down. 

Thenardier installed liimself in a cappadine clitiir, took up the 
two newsjtapers, thru.st them hack into the envelo|H*. mid imiftered, 
striking the Draf&gt;eau Hlaiic with his nail: “It cost me some ban! 
work to get this one." 'I'his done, he crossed his legs and lay litick 
in his chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what 
they are sajdng, then entered into tlie suliject .seriously, and em- 
phasising his words : 

"Monsieur Baron, on the 6ih of June, !8,^2, about a vear ago, the 
day of the mieute, a man was in ilu’ Clraml Sewer of I'uris, near 
where the sewer empties into the Seine, iR-twcen the rout ties iii- 
vaUdes and the Pont d’leiia." 

Marius suddenly drew his chair nmr 'fh^ardicr’s. Thenardier 
aw^ced tWs movement, and coniinue* wiili the dclilwration of a 
weaker who holds his intcrkicuior fast, and who feels the palpita- 
wu^ Ma adversary beneath his words ; 

compelled to conceal himself, for reasons foreign to 
odlittcs, however, nad taken the sewer for his dwelling, and iwd • 
key to it. It was, I repeat it, the 6th of June ; it might have been eight 
o’clock in the evening. The man heard a noise in the sewer. Very 
much surprised, he hid himself, and watched. It was a sound of 
steps, smnehody was walking in the darkness ; somebody was oxning 
la ms direction. Strange to aay, there was another man in the aewer 
hesicte Mnt^ The gnMiog of the outlet of the sewer was not far «l. 
,^lfttle%ht whioi cahM fnm k wtbled bim to reoov^ the new- 



JEAN VAL JEAN 1211 

comer, and to see that this man was carrying something on his back. 
He walked bent over. The man who was walking bent over was an 
old convict, and what he was carrying upon his shoulders was a 
corpse. Assassination in flagrante delicto, if ever there was such a 
thing. As for Ae robbery, it follows of course; nobody kills a man 
for nothmg. This convict was going to throw his corpse into the 
river. It is noteworthy fact, that before reaching the grating of 
the outlet, this convict, who came from a distance in the sewer, had 
been compelled to pass through a horrible quagmire in which it 
would seem that he might have left the corpse ; but, the sewer-men 
working upon the quagmire might, the very next day, have found the 
assassinated man, and that was not the assassin’s game. He preferred 
to go through the quagmire with his load, and his efforts must have 
been terrible ; it is impossible to put one’s life in greater peril; I do 
not understand how he came out of it alive.” 

Marius’ chair drew still nearer. Tlufnardier took advantage of it 
to draw ii long breath. He continued : 

“Monsieur llaron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lacks 
everything there, even room. When two men are in a sewer, they 
must meet each other. That is what happened. The resident and the 
traveller were compelled to say good-day to each other, to their 
mutual regret. The traveller said to the resident: “You see what I 
have cm my back, I must get out, you have the key, give it to me.” 
’I'hi.s convict was a man of terrible strength. There was no refusing 
hiin. Still he who had the key parleyed, merely to gain time. He ex- 
amined the dead man, but he could see nothing, except that he was 
young, well dressed, apparently a rich man, and all disfigured with 
blood. While he was talking, he found means to cut and tear off 
f rom heliind, without the assassin perceiving it, a piece of the assas- 
* sinated man’.s coat. A pjece of evidence, you understand ; means of 
getting trace of the affair, and proving the crime upon the criminal. 
He put this piece of evidence in his pocket. After which he opened 
the grating, let the man out with his incumbrance on his back, shut 
the grating again and escaped, little caring to be mixed up with the 
remainder of the adventure, and especially desiring not to be present 
when the assassin should throw the assassinated man into the river. 
You understand now. He who was carrying the corpse was Jean 
Vaijean ; he who had the key is now speaking to you, .and the piece 
of the coat ” 

Th^nardier finished the phrase by drawing from his pocket and 
holding up, on a level with his eyes, between his thumbs and his fore- 
fingers, a strip of ragged black cloth, covered with dark stains. 

Marius had risen, j^le, hardly breathing, his eye fixed upon the 
scrap of black doth, and, without uttering a word, without losing 
sight of this rag, he retreated to the wall, and, with his right hand 
stretched ^hind him, groped about for a key which was in the lock 



1212 LESMlSEKABI-ES 

of a closet near the chimney. He found this key, oiwnecl the closet, 
and thrust his arm into it without looking, and without removing 
his startled eyes from the fragment that Thcnardier held up. 

Meanwhile Thcnardier continued ; 

“Monsieur Baron, I have the .strongest rea,sons to believe that the 
assassinated young man was an opulent stranger drawn into a 
snare by Jean Valjean, and the bearer of an cnontious sum.” 

“The young man was myself, and there is the coat !” cried Marius, 
and he threw an old black coat covered with blood upon the carpet. 

Then, snatching the fragment from Thenardier’s hands, he bent 
down over the coat, and applied the piece tt) the cut skirt. The edges 
fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat. 

Thcnardier was petrified. He thouglit this: “I am iloore&lt;I.” 

Marius rose up, quivering, de.Hperate, flaslung. 

He felt in hi.s pocket, and walkwl, furious, towards 'riicnardier, 
offering him and almost pushing into hi.s face hi.s fi.st full of live 
hundred and a thousand franc notes. 

“You are a wretch! you are a liar, a slamlerer, a scoundrel. You 
came to accuse this man, you have juslifietl him ; you wanted to 
destroy him, you have .succeeded only in glorifying him. And it is 
you who are a robber ! and it is you who are an aswissin, 1 .saw you, 
Thimardier, Jondrette, in that den on the Boulevard de rilopital- 
I know etiough alH&gt;ut you to .send y‘&gt;u to the galleys, and further 
even, if I wished. Here, there are a tlum.s.and francs, braggart that 
you are !” 

And he threw a bill for a thousand francs to 'riu'nardier. 

“Ahl Jondrette 'riienardier, vile knave I let this be a lesson to 
you, pedlar of secrets, trader in my.stcries, fumbler in the tiark, 
wretch ! Take these five hundred francs, and leave thi.s place ! Water- . 
Ido protects you.’* 

“Waterloo!" muttered Thcnardier, pocketing the five hundred! 
francs with the thousand franc.s. 

“Yes, assassin ! you .savctl tltc life of a colonel there " 

“Of a general," said Thcnardier, raising his liead. 

“Of a colonel 1” replied Marius with a hurst of passion. "I would 
not give a farthing for a general. And you came here to act out your 
infamy ! I tell you that you have committed every crime. Go ! out of 
my sight 1 Be happy only, that is all that I desire. Ahl monster I 
there are three thousand francs more. Take them. You will start 
to-morrow for America, with your daughter, for your wife is dead* 
abominable liar. I wrill see to your departure, bandit, and I will count 
out to you then twenty thousand francs. Go and get hung elsewhere !" 

“Monsieur J^aron," answered Th^xardtw, bowing to the ground* 
“eternal gratitude." 

And llilBardier srant out, cim a prei i endiaf nothiim;, astounded mA

transported with this sweet crushing under sacks of gold and with 
this^ thunderbolt bursting upon his head in bank-notes. 

1 hunderstnick he was, but happy also; and he would have been 
very sorry to have had a. lightning rod against that thunderbolt. 

Let us finish with this man at once. Two days after the events 
which we are now relating, he left, through Marius’ care, for Amer- 
ica, under a false name, with his daughter Azelma, provided with 
a draft upon New York for twenty thousand francs. Thenardier, 
the moral misery of Thenardier, the brokendown bourgeois, was 
irremeiliable j he was in America what he had been in Europe. The 
touch of a wicked man is often enough to corrupt a good deed and 
to make an evil result spring from it. With Marius’ money, Thenar- 
tlier became a slaver. 

As soon as Thenardier was out of doors, Marius ran to the gar- 
den where Cosette was still walking ; 

“Co.sette! Cosette !”' cried he. “Come! come quick! Let us go. 
flasque, a fiacre ! Cosette, come. Oh ! my God ! It was he who saved 
iny life ! Let us not lose a minute ! Put on your shawl.” 

Cosette thought him mad, and obeyed. 

lie did not breatlu:, he put his hand upon his heart to repress its 
lieating. Tie walked to and fro with rapid strides, he embraced Co- 
setle : “Oli ! Cioselte ! I am an unhappy man !” said he. 

Miirius was in amaze. He began to see in this Jean Valjean a 
.strangely lofty and saddened form. An unparalleled virtue appeared 
beftjre him, supreme and mild, humble in its immensity. The oonvict 
was tninsligured into Christ. Marius was bewildered by this mar- 
vel. He did not know exactly what he saw, but it was grand. 

In it moment, a fiacre was at the door. 

Marius helped Cosette in and .sprang in himself. 

“Driver,” said he, “Rue de I’Homme Arm6, Number 7.” 

'J'hc fiacre started. 

“Oh ! what happine.s.s !” said Cosette. “Rue de I’Homme Arme ! I 
dared not .speak to you of it again. We are going to see Monsieur 
jean.” 

“Your father! Co.sette, your, father more than ever. Cosette, I 
see it. You told me that you never received the letter which I sent 
you by Gavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went 
to the barricade to save me. As it is a necessity for him to be an 
angel, on the way, he saved others; he saved Javert. He snatched 
me out of tltat gulf to give me to you. He carried me on his back in 
that frightful sewer, C)h ! I am an unnatural ingrate. Cosette, after 
having been your providence, he was mine. Only think that there was 
i horrible quagmire, enough to drown him a hundred times, to drown 
him in the mire, Cosette ! he carried me through that. I had fainted ; 
I saw nothing, I heard nothing, I could know notlung of my ovm 
fate. We are going to bring him back, take him with whether

“V'uu are riglU.” said she to him. 

Meanwhile the iiaere rolled on.

At the knock which he heard at his door, lean V'aljean turned Itis 
head. 

"Come in," said he feehly. 

Tlie door oiieiied, Cost'tle and Marins appeared. 

t ‘o.selte rushed into the rtmn. 

Marius remained upon tlic threshohl, leaning against the easing 
of the door. 

"Cosette!" .said Jean X’aljean, and he rose in his chair. Ins arms 
stretched out and Iremhling, liaggard, livid, lerrililc, with immense 
joy in his eyes. 

Cosette sidled with eii»tti«in. fell npon )ean V'al jean's Ineast. 

“Father r .said .she. . . ; 

Jean Valjean, beside himself, stammered : 

“Cosette! she? you, madanjc? it is ytni. Cosetl*’? t &gt;h, my tiod!' 

And, clasped in Cosette’s arms, he exelaimed ; 

“It is you, Cosette? you are here? Yon forgive me then!” 

Marius, dropping his eyelids tltat the tears might not fall, stepix-d 
forward and murmured between his lips wliieli were contracted 
convulsively to check the .sohs : 

"Father r 

“And you too, you forgive me !“ said Jean Valjean. 

Marius could not utter a word, and Jean Valjean added; 
' Thania." 

C^tsette todc off her shawl and tiircw her liat ujxjit the bed. 

“Tlwy are in my way,” said she. 

And, seating herself up&lt;m the old man’s knees, she sirokctl away 
Hus white hair with an adorable grace, and kissed his forehead. 

Jean Valjean, bewildered, offered no resistance, 

^sette, who had but a veiy confused understanding of all this, 
redoubled her caresses, as if she would pay Marius' debt. 

lean Valjean faltered :

miserable man, I shall never see Cosette again, I was saying that at 
the very nwment you were coming up the stairs. Was I not silly? 
I was as silly as that ! But we reckon without God. God said: You 
think that you are going to be abandoned, dolt? No. No, it shall not- 
come to pass like that. Come, here is a poor goodman who has need 
of an angel. And the angel comes ; and I see my Cosette again ! and 
I .see my darling Cosette again ! Oh ! I was very miserable !” 

I'or a moment he could not speak, then he continued : 

“I really needed to see Cosette a little while from time to time. A 
heart does want a bone to gnaw. Still I felt plainly that I was in the 
way. I gave myself reasons : they have no need of you, stay in your 
corner, you have no right to continue for ever. Oh! bless God, I 
.see her again 1 Do you know, Cosette, that your husband is very 
handsome? Ah, you have a pretty embroidered collar, yes, yes. -I 
like that pattern. Your husband chose it, did not he ? And then, Cos- 
ette, you must have cashmeres. Monsieur Pontmercy, let me call 
her Cosette. It will not be very long.” 

And C'o.selte continued again : , 

“1 low naughty to have left us in this way ! Where have you been? 
why were you away so long ? Your journeys did not use to last more 
tluin tltrec or four days. 1 sent Nicolette, the answer always was : 
He is absent. How long since you returned? Why did not you let 
us know ? Do you know that you are veiy much changed. Oh 1 the 
naughty father! he has been sick,_ and we did not know it! Here, 
Muriius, feel his hand, how cold it is !” 

“So you arc here, Monsieur Pontmercy, you forgive me!” re- 
peated Jean Valjean. 

At these words, which Jean Valjean now said for the second tirpe, 
all thiit was swelling in Marius heart found an outlet, he broke forth : 

“Cosette, do you hear ? that is the way with him ! he begs my par- 
don, and do you know what he has done for me, Cosette? he has 
.saved my life. He has done more. He has given you to me. And, after 
having stived me, and after having given you to me, Cosette, what 
did he do with himself ? he sacrificed himself. There is the man. And, 
to me the ungrateful, to me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me 
the guilty, he says : Thanks ! Cosette, my whole life passed at the 
feet of this man would be too little. That barricade, that sewer, that 
furnace, that cloaca, he went through everything for me, for you, 
Cosette! He bore me through death in every form which he put 
aside from me, and which he accepted for himself. All courage, all 
virtue, all heroism, all sanctity, he has it all, Cosette, that man is an 

*”^Hush! hushl” said Jean Valjean in a whisper. "'Why tell all 

that?” . . , . . , . , 

“But you 1” exclaimed Harms, with a passion in which veneration 
was mingled, “why have not you told it? It is your fault, too. You

those big tears which are the gloomy pearls of the soul, gathered 
elowly in his eye. He murmured : 

“1’he proof that God is good is that she is here.” 

“Father !” cried Cosette. 

Jean Valjean continued : 

“It is veiy true that it would be charming to live together. They 
have their trees full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. To be 
with people who live, who bid each other good morning, who call 
each other into the garden, would be sweet. We would see each other 
as soon as it was morning. We would each cultivate our little cor- 
ner. She would have me eat her strawberries. I would have her pick 
my roses. It would be charming. Only ” 

He pati-sed and said mildly : 

“It is a pity.” 

'fhe tear did not fall, it went back, and Jean Valjean replaced it 
with a smile. 

Cosette took both the old man’s hands in her own. 

“My God !” said she, “your hands are colder yet. Are you sick ? 
Arc you suffering ?” 

“No,” answered Jean Valjean. “I am very well. Only- ” 

He stopped. 

“Only what ?” 

“I shall die in a few minutes.” 


Cosette and Marius shuddered. 

“Die 1” exclaimed Marius. 

“Yes, but that is nothing,” said Jean Valjean. 

He breathed, smiled, and continued. 

“Cosette, you are speaking to me, go on, speak again, your little 
red-breast is dead then, speak, let me hear your voice !” 

Marius, petrified, gazed upon the old man. 

Cosette uttered a piercing cry: _ _ 

“Father ! my father ! you shall live. You are going to live. I will 
have you live, do you hear 1 ” » ... 

Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration. 

“Oh yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? I shall obey perhaps. I 
was just dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me 
that I was born again," 

'^You are full of strength and life,” exclaimed Marius. Do you 
think people die like that ? You have had trouble, you shall bave no 
more. I a.sk your pardon now, and that on my knees! You shall 
live, and live with us, and live long. We will take you back. Both 
of us here will have but one thought henceforth, your happiness 1 

“You see,” added Cosette in tears, “that Marius says you will 


not die.”

There was a noise at the door. It w:ts the physician coming in. 

'"Ciiood &lt;l!iy and gooil-by, doctor," .said Je:m Maljcan. "Here arc 
my poor children.” 

Marius ajiproached the physu-ian. He atldressed this single word 
to him : "Monsieur ?” hut iu the manner of prt»miimcing it, there was 
a complete (jnestioji. 

The physician answered the tinesiion hy an exftressive gliince. 

"llecause things are unpletisant," .said Jean Valjcan, "that is no 
reason h»r heing imjiisl towards (iod." 

There w:is a silence. All hearts were oispressei!. 

Jean Vtiljean ttirncd towards f’oselte. He began to g.ij!e at lier 
fts if he wotili! lake a look which should endure through eternity. 
At the depth of .sharlow to winch he had alrettdy deMendctl. eest.isy 
was still possible to him while lieholding I'oseite, 'I'he relletiion of 
that sweet countenance lllumincfl his pale ftice. The scpuichre may 
tiave its cnchajumcnis. 

The jihy.sician felt his pulse. 

"Ah! it was yt»u he ueetled!" murmured he, looking at C'oselte 
and Marius, 

And, bending towtirds M;trius' ear he a«lde&lt;l very low : 

“'foo late." * 

Jean 'Valjcan, almost without ceasing to gaxr u|hiu C'oscttc, turned 
.l^n Marius and the pliysician a U«»k of screnit)*. They heard these 
•h^t inarticulate wonls ctMuc from his lips : 

, f*It ia nothing to die; it is frightful not to live." 

, Suddttdy he arose. These returns of strength are sometimes a 
4^ of dm deathnitruggle. He walked with a Arm step to the wall, 
and the physician, who ofTered to assist him, took 
from dm i«ll the little cop[&gt;er crucifix which hung there, came 
and sat down with alt the freedom ol motion of perfect health, 
/Up! Pid in a knui vdee, laying the crucifix on the table : 

./ .**B«i*oId the great nrnrtyr." 

tareaP sank fak Ms head wavered, as if the dtssiness of

the tomb seized him, and his hands resting upon his .knees, began 
to clutch as his pantaloons. 

Cosette supported his shoulders, and sobbed, and attempted to 
speak to him, but could not. There could be distinguished, among the 
words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears, 
sentences like this : “Father ! do not leave us. Is it possible that we 
have found you again only to lose you ?” 

The agony of death may be said to meander. It goes, cornes, ad- 
vances towards the grave, and returns towards life. There is some 
groping in the act of dying. 

Jean Valjean, after this semi-syncope, gathered strength, shook 
hi.s forehead as if to throw off the darkness, and became almost 
completely lucid once more. He took a fold of Cosette’s sleeve, and 
kissed it. 

“He is reviving ! doctor, he is reviving !” cried Marius. 

“You are both kind,” said Jean Valjean. “I will tell you what has 
given me pain. What has given me pain, Monsieur Pontmercy, was 
that you have been unwilling to touch that money. That money 
really belongs to your wife. I will explain it to you, my children, on 
that account I am glad to see you. The black jet_ comes from Eng- 
land, the white jet comes from Norway. All this is in the paper you 
sec there, which you will read. For bracelets, I invented the substi- 
tution of clasps made by bending the metal, for clasps made by 
soldering the metal. They are handsomer, better, and cheaper. You 
understand how much money can be made. So Cosette’s fortune is 
really her own. I give you these particulars, so that your minds may 
bcatre.st.” 

The portress had come up, and was looking through the half-open 
door. The physician motioned her away, but he could not prevent 
that good, zealous woman from crying to the dying man before she 
went: ' 

“Do you want a pric.st ?” 

*T have one,” answered Jean Valjean. _ 

And, with his finger, he seemed to designate a point above his 
head, where, you would have said, he saw some one. 

It is probable that the Bishop was indeed a witness of this death- 

■ Cosette slipped a pillow under his back gently. 

Jean Valjean resumed : ' . rpi. • 

“Monsieur Pontmercy, have no fear, I conjure you. The six 
hundred thousand francs are really Cosette’s. I shall have lost my 
life if you do not enjoy it ! We succeeded very well in yaking glass- 
work, We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. Indeed, the Ger- 
man black glass cannot be compared with it. A gross, which contains 
twelve hundred grains very well cut, costs only three iraiicS. _ _

(villi a lonk which clings to him, and which would hold him hack. 

Both, dumb with rin,guisl), knowing not wluit tr» say to death, desi&gt;air- 

ing and trembling, they stood before him, Marius holding C'osetle’s 

hand. 

]''roin moment to jiionient, Jean Vuljean grew weaker. I fe was 
sinking; he was a|ii&gt;ro:u‘liing the dark horizon, ,1 lis Itreafh had he- 
come iiitennitteiit ; it was interruiiled by a slight rattle, fie had 
difficulty in moving his wrist, his feet had li»st ;ill motion, and, at 
the .same time that the distress of the limbs and llu; exhaust ion of the 
body iiicrea-scfl, all the majesty of tin; soul rose and displayed itself 
iijtnn Ins ftirehead. 'I'he lijfht of the unknown work! was already 
visiiile in his lye. 

J'fis face grew pale, and at (lie sain&lt;* time .smiled. Life was no lon- 
ger present, there w.as suinething el&gt;e, 11 is breath died away, his 
look grevv grand. It wtis a corjise on which yon felt wings.

them in n voice .so faint it seemed to eome from af.ar, anil yon would

* JEANVALJEAN 1221 

I saw her a little pale, I was sad. There is a five hundred franc bill 
in the bureau. I have not touched it. It is for the poor. Cosette, do 
you see your little dress, there on the bed ? do you recognise it ? Yet 
it was only ten years ago. How time passes! We have been very 
hapi^y. It is over. My children, do not weep, I am not going very far, 

I shall s&lt;‘e you from there. You will only have to look when it is 
night, you will see me smile. Cosette, do you remember Monffer- 
meil? You were in the wood, you were very much frightened; do 
you remember when I took the handle of the ^^ater-bucket? That 
was the first lime I touched your poor little hand. It was so cold! 
Ah ! you liad red hands in those days, mademoiselle, your hands are 
v(‘ry white now. And the great doll ! do you remember ? yoti called 
her ( ntharine. You regretted that you did not carry her to the con- 
Y&lt;‘nt. I low you made me laugh sometimes, my sweet angel ! When it 
had rained you launched spears of straw in the gutters, and you 
watched them. One day, I gave you a willow battledore, and a shut- 
thvoek with yellow, blue, and green feathers. You have forgotten 
it. \hni were so cunning when you were little ! You played. You put 
cherri&lt;*s in your ears. Those are things of the past. The forests 
ihrougli whicli we have passed with our child, the trees under which 
we liave walked, the convents in which we have hidden, the games, 
tite freti laugliter of childhood, all is in shadow. I imagined that all 
iliat belonged to me. There was my folly. Those Thenardiers were 
wicked. We must forgive them. Cosette, the time hp come to tell 
ymi the name of yottr mother. Her name was Fantine. Remember 
tliat name : Fantine. P'all on your knees whenever you pronounce it 
sin? suffered much. And loved you much. Her measure of unhappi- 
ness was as full as yours of happiness. Such are the distributions of 
' Gml l ie is on high, he sees us all,,andhe knows what he does in the 
midst nf his great stars. So I am going away, my children. Love each 
other dearly alway.s. There is scarcely anything else in the world 
but that : to love one another. You will think sometimes of the 
old man who died here. O my Cosette ! it is not my fault, indeed, if 
I have not .seen you all this time, it broke my heart ; I went as far as 
tlie corner of the street, I mu.st have seemed strange tp the jjeople 
wln&gt; sa w me puss, I looked like a crazy man, once I went out with no 
hat Mv children, I do not see very clearly now, I had some more 
thiiiKs to say, hut it makes no difference. Think of me a little. You 
are hiessei! ereature.s. I do not know what is the matter with me, I 
see a light. Come nearer.^ I die happy. Let me put my hands upon 

ytnir dear beloved heads.” , . , i i j
